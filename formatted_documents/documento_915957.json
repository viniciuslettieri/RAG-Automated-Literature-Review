The importance of the performance of a rail system to the logistics of goods in countries with large territorial dimensions i s recognized. However, its role is secondary in Brazil compared to road transport, representing high economic and environmental costs. SFBC is dedicated to the export of mineral and agricultural bulk where it has a significant capacity for insertion . Mean while, the SFBC has an insignificant participation in the internal distribution of goods, which is mostly done in highway s, including on longer routes . Consequently , the transport sector in Brazil emits twice as much CO 2 from burning fuels than the world av erage. SFBC presents characteristics of a medium performance scenario. The performance of the operators is heterogeneous, benchmarking is an outlier, the average efficiency is low, and the average idleness of the sections is high. To discuss the conditions to achieve a high performance scenario is the ma in contribution of this thesis. Three researches were done to address this issue. The first one is dedicated to estimate the efficiency of the railway concessionaires in Brazil between 2010 -2014 by using Dat a Envelopment Analysis. In a second stage, the si gnificance of selected variables was assessed through Bootstrap Truncated Regression, including the type of the use of the railway track (shared or monopoly) , a gap in the literature. The operators were grou ped according to the efficiency scores and the ty pe of returns to scale , and measures to increase the efficiency of the clusters were discussed. The second research has the purpose to explain the heterogeneity found in the average efficiency of the differe nt railway systems in the world, the object of re searches done between 2000 -2016 , through a meta -analysis carried out for the first time on rail ways . For greater robustness, Leave -One-Out-Cross -Validation and Weighted Regression were applied . Public polici es including diversification of services and mode ls for assessing efficiency by regulatory agencies were discussed. The third research is devoted to the efficiency of the SFBC railway sections and identifies the significant conditions for high and low performance scenarios by combining the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution and a differential evolution algorithm for estimating the weights of variables in optimized scenarios, another gap in the literature. In a second stage, th e significance of the variables selected was evaluated . The research shows that the public manager should push the rail companies toward the transportation of any type of cargo, the diversification of services, the centralized control of the operation, and the sharing of the railway track. The competitio n and diversification are significant for high performance.", "Keywords: railways, Brazil, efficiency, DEA, BTR, meta -analysis, TOPSIS, genetic algorithm.", "RESUMO", "MARCHETTI, Dalmo dos Santos.

However, new economic and environmental factors have revitalized the rail tra nsport such as the restriction of using fossil fuels and th e control of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, the effort to reduce costs, the search for better living conditions and the restriction of using cars in cities, and the impetus toward intermodalism (HARRISON ; DONNELLY, 2011 ; RODRIGUE; COMTOIS; SLACK, 2013) .", "The technological developmen t and the new transportation policies are at the origin of seeing value again in railways as an option for efficient and sustainable transport. Since the 1960s, the emer gence of the High Speed Rail (HSR) technology in Japan, and in the next decade in Franc e, repositioned the fate of rail transport. Technological improvements created faster and more efficient long -distance connections, causing them to be highly competitive with road and air travel (RODRIGUE; COMTOIS; SLACK, 2013) . By the 1980s, public policies had been put in place to promote th e revitalization of rail transport, especially for cargo. The regulatory models put int o practice in the United States and the European Union sought to ensure the best allocation of resources, increase the efficiency, and take back again the market share l ost, being one of the pillars of the rai l transport resurgence (CARBAJO; DE RUS, 1991; EUROPEAN POLI CY CENTRE, [s.d.]; LEGAL INFORMATION INSTITUTE, [s.d.]; WHEAT; NASH, 2006). In the United States, the Staggers Rail Act (US, 1980) arises as a result of the then recent theory of contestable markets developed at the end of the 1970s by Baumol , Panzar and Willig (1982) , which was also applied to the ground and air transport sectors in the American market. Guidelines for the developme nt of railways in the European Union were drawn up in the community . Directive 91/440/EEC (EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 1991) is aimed at promoting competition and integration between the rail transport systems i n Europe, whose measures began to be adopted by the Member States sin ce 2001 .", "In Brazil, following the external influence, the rail system was developed at the end of the 19th century, expanded, and declined. It went under State control at the end of the 1930s, the administration of the cargo service was separated from tha t of urban passengers in the 1980s, and the productivity indicators were recovered after the privatization process and concession of the network , previously administered by the state comp any Rede Ferroviária Federal S.A. (RFFSA), which took place at the end of the 1990s. However, despite the resumption of", "investment, the increase in the production volume, and the reduction of the number of accidents recorded in the period after the concess ion (MARCHETTI; FERREIRA, 2012) , the SFBC is heterogeneous, pres enting different standards of efficiency , and distinct physical and operational characteristics (MARCHETTI; WANKE, 2 017). The set of attributes of the Brazilian rail cargo system (BRCS ), among them the low average efficiency, the high average idleness of the sections, the low productivity of the railway track, the low diversity of se rvices and types of cargo, no statistical significance as to the type of use of the rail (if shared or in monopoly), and the heterogeneity among the operators , characterizes a medium performance scenario as will be discussed in the third paper of this thes is. This condition suggests to explain the low participation of the rail transport in the transportation modal matrix in Brazil , and the highest participation of the transport sector in emitting CO 2 from burning fossil fuels in Brazil (46%) , compared with the global average (23%) (FERREIRA et al., 2016; IEA, 201 3). More details on the SFBC are provided in the subsections 1.1.2 and 1.1.3. The greatest challenge of the managers and public administrators in Brazil is to move the SFBC to a high performa nce scenario.", "The federal government, which is responsible for planning in the railway sector, is in the process of discussing and analyzing the early extension of the existing concessions on the basis of Law No. 13,448 , of June 5, 2017 (BRAZIL, [s.d.]) . Among other aspects, the Law No. 13,448 sets th e conditions for the advance extension of concession contracts in the railway sector as long as it is timely requested by the incumbent s. The early extension is linked, among other terms, to the inclusion of investments not forese en in the original contrac t in order to meet the growth in demand , and the elaboration of a technical study by the incumbent that proves the advantage of extending the current contract compared to holding a new bid. To assess whether the provisions of Law No. 13,448 are able to enc ourage the concessionaires toward a SFBC high performance scenario is the subsidiary question of this research.", "In Brazil, the National Land Transportation Agency (ANTT), responsible for monitoring, regulating, and inspecting the SFBC, does not evaluate th e efficiency of the rail concessionaires by methods widely used in the literature, which makes it more difficult to decide for the early extension of existing contracts due to the interest on the part of the public administration. The planning of investmen ts within the framework of the federal government is limited to new concessions (BRAZIL, [s.d.]) , and does not present objectively what is the role of the railway network in the transportation sector in Brazil, including which targets it should reach, and what economic results it should o ffer to society in the long term. Issues such as SFBC’s level of average performance, the insertion of rail transport according to the type of", "cargo, the provision of new services , the entry of new operators, the regional and inter -regional transport of pa ssengers, the level of intermodal operations, and the developmen t of rail corridors for the regional integration have not been systematically planned or addressed in an effective way to change the reality of SBFC’s current attributes . The planning of the f ederal government is highly linked to the construction of new isolated railways (BRAZIL, [s.d.]) on the basis of proposals mostly presented from the export private sector, with a low systemic vision , similar to what happened in the development of the Brazilian system in the late 19th cent ury, that was characterized by a dispersion and isolation of the railways. The North -South Railway, otherwise, planned by the federal government , is a single example of a regional integration railway.", "The theme of this research is the efficiency of the rai lway systems. The objective of the research is to answer the fol lowing four questions: What is the efficiency of the SBFC concessionaires? What are the variables and the significant factors for SBFC’s efficiency? What are the evidences extracted from previ ous research es that influenced the average efficiency of different rail systems in the world? What are the conditions required to push SBFC to high performance? Therefore, three independent scientific papers were developed us ing different databases and met hodologies tha t together allow readers to obtain the evidences and insights that answer these research questions.", "The first paper is entitled Brazil's Rail Freight Transport: Efficiency Analysis Using Two-Stage DEA and Cluster -Driven Public Policies and de als with the e fficiency of the SFBC using Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) , widely applied to evaluate the relative performance of Decision Making Units (DMUs) (MARKOVITS -SOMOGYI, 2011; WANKE; BARROS, 2015) . The efficiency of the SFBC concessionaires for the period 2010 -2014 was evaluated when a new regulation that sought to boost competition in the system w as put into pr actice. Through the Bootstrap Truncated Regression (BTR) model, in a second stage, the significance of exogenous variables in the performance of the concessionaires was estimated , such as the type of cargo, the gauge (track width), and the ty pe of use of t he railway (if shared or in monopoly). The significance of the new regulations on the efficiency of the DMUs (SFBC concessionaires ) and the methodological structure itself in two stages were constituted in the gap in the literature. The artic le also propos ed the grouping of the concessionaires into clusters according to their efficiency score and the type of the return s to scale (RTS) of each concessionaire ( whether increasing, constant, or decreasing). Public policies to increase the efficien cy of each one of these clusters were discussed , such as : increase in scale of operations with expansion of inputs (upsizing) ; best combination and/or reduction of inputs (downsizing) ;", "and, simultaneously, the adoption of better operational practices, impr ovement in the railway infrastructure to increase the asset s turnover, and upsizing (or downsizing).", "The second paper is entitled Efficiency in rail transport: Evaluation of the main drivers through meta -analysis with resampling and reveals through a meta -analysis of 21 articles published between 2000 -2016 the variables and the factors that explain a significant part of the heterogeneity found between the different efficiency frontiers observed in different rail systems , with distinct characteristics and me thodologies applied by the authors. Meta -analysis is a systematic review model from literature supported by statistical methods increasingly adopted in social sciences but , as to our best knowledge , used for the first time to aggregate and contrast results of researc hes on efficiency frontier of railways. From a systematic review of the articles, the research aimed at obtaining results not identified in each study individually to explain the variance in the average efficiency estimate s. Among the findings, the article concludes with an important evidence for the Brazilian market where there is predominance or almost exclusive transport of cargo on the existing rail network. Other conclusions of a methodological nature are also presented and contribute to the best perfo rmance of the role performed by monitoring, regulatory and inspection agencies, which should evaluate the efficiency of public services applying methods widely used in the literature. Validation methods were presented regarding the independence of the term s, the independence of the observations, the requirement of normal distribution of the dependent variable, and other potential sources of biases in the results (HIGGINS; THOMPSON, 2004) , bring ing robustness to the results and becoming a true research finding.", "The third paper is entitled Efficiency of the rail sections in the B razilian railway system using TOPSIS and a Genetic Algorithm to analyze optimized scenarios and evaluates the efficiency of the rail sections using a TOPSIS methodology that when combined with a genetic algorithm of differential evolution estimates the wei ghts of the positive and negative TOPSIS variables and simulates the behavior of the scores in the optimized low and high performance scenarios. The use of a genetic algorithm for estimating weights in optimized scen arios was, as to our best knowledge, a m ethodological innovation. In the literature, it is common to use a genetic algorithm together with the TOPSIS model, but in a different way from the one proposed in th e paper . Evolutionary algorithms are usually used to optimize multi -objective functions i n different systems or products and the TOPSIS methodology is commonly used in a second stage to rank the optimal solutions found. The use of the railway sections as a unit of analysis also enabled innovative conclus ions about the efficiency of the Brazili an rail system because it linked the physical, operational, capacity, and regulation characteristics of the", "railway sections of the network. By using a Tobit model, the significance of contextual variables selected i n each optimized scenario was analyzed, such as the operator, the predominant type of cargo transported, the type of technology used in the operation, and the type of use of the railway section (whether open or restricted) . The significant attributes of low and high performance were highlighted. Finally, by analyzing the percentiles of the scores, it was possible to identify the least and most efficient railway sections for each scenario, offering a contribution of an admin istrative -managerial nature. The reading of the three papers in sequence w ill allow readers to gather evidences and obtain their own insights on how to leverage the efficiency of a railway system and what mechanisms are needed to drive and push the SFBC in to high performance scenario.", "This thesis is divided into five parts. The theme, gaps found in the literature, and the questions of the research are presented in Section 1. A contextualization in subsection 1.1 prepares the reader for the papers . From Section 2 to 4 is the development of the research itself , in the format of th ree scientific papers that complement each other , providing the reader the conditions that explain the efficiency and the significant attributes for SFBC’s high performance. In subsection s 5.1 to 5.3 , the conclusions and recommendations are presented, answ ering the research questions.

The most important cities were coastal cities in the Baltic, North and Mediterranean Seas, and the ports located in the interior of the European co ntinent, such as London, Norwich, Königsberg, Hamburg, Bruges, Bordeaux, Lyon, Lisbon, Barcelona and Venice. The maritime connections were the principal way to commercial exchange and", "reflected country´s economic strength. The industrial revolution during the 18th and 19th centuries brought significant changes to the transport systems. The emergence of the steam engine, attributed to Watt in 1765, beyond giving great impetus to the maritime systems, introduced the rail system (RODR IGUE; COMTOIS; SLACK, 2013) .", "The steam engines w ere widely applied on railways. In 1814, George Stephenson, English mechanical engineer, presented the first project of a steam locomotive, given the start to the railway age. The need of an economic transport of large volumes of cargo, with higher speed and for more distant sites were t he main aspects that boosted the project (MUNHOZ, [s.d.]) . In 1830, Stephenson constructed the locomotives used in the first commercial railroad for the tra nsportation of coal between Manchester and Liverpool (65 km) (WIKIPÉDIA, [s.d.]) . Railroads were then built in England, Western Europe and North America. The first railway in Japan date 1872. In the United States railroads appeared to first complement the main important systems of channels. Soon, railroads begun to be more efficient than channels and their natural substitute. In the late 19th century, 130,000 km of railways were laid in the United States. Transcontinental railway lines were built in the United S tates (New York to San Francisco, 1869), Canada (Trans -Canadian Railway, 1886) and Russia (Trans -Siberian Railway, 1904). With the development of the engines, rail networks developed worldwide. Cities sprung up along the railways. Rail services became spec ialized, offering passenger, cargo and mixed services. The growth of urban pop ulation favoured the construction of railways for the public transportation of passengers , and subway systems were built in major European metropolitan areas.", "However, with the development of highways in the last century , and an economy focused on the int ensive use of the automobile, the conventional rail system reduced its importance (RODRIGUE; COMTOIS; SLACK, 2013) . In the si xties , a disruption happened. On October 1st, 1964, the Japanese national railways started the operation of a 515 km standard gauge line (1 ,435 mm) named the Tokaido Shinkansen, from Tokyo Central to Shin Osaka. Initially designed to operate at 210 km/h, its meaning was that th e HSR technology had just born. On September 27, 1981, in turn, the Société Nationale des Chemins de Fer Français , the national French railway company, started the operation of the first high speed line between Paris to Lyons, at a m aximum speed of 260 km/h. The European HSR was born. More recently, the HSR technology was developed especially in China, who implemente d a network more than 21,000 km long (UIC, 2015) , and in Korea and Taiwan.", "The expansion of the railways reached its height in the 20th century but is still expanding denoting vitality. The rail infrastructure in the world is divided among Europe", "(29%), for passenger and cargo services, mainly in Germany, France and Ukraine; Asia and Oceania (26%), intended to meet the major part of the global passenger demand located in Japan, China and India, but also cargo , mainly in China and India; Americas (30%), with the predominant cargo transportation; Russia (9%), mainly for cargo transport, but also passenger services; and Africa (6%), for cargo and passenger transpor t (UIC, 2015) . The HSR technology is present mainly in Asia (75%) and Europe (24%). The highlights are the Japanese, French and German systems and the recent Chinese system. Spain, Italy, South Korea, and Taiwan are other remarkable countries using the HSR technology (UIC, [s.d.]) .", "1.1.2 The Development of the Brazilian Rail System", "The implementation of the Bra zilian r ail system dates back to the second half of the 19th century. The first rail section was introduced approximately 24 years after the laying of the first commercial railway line in England. Irineu Evangelista de Souza envisioned and built in Rio de Janeiro the Mauá Rail road, a first rail line 14.5 km long and 1.68 m gauge between the port of Estrela at the bottom of the Guanabara Bay , in a location called Raiz da Serra , in the direction of the imperial city of Petrópolis. The Baron of Mauá, as he was known, also participated in drafting or negotiating nine other railroads in Brazil (WIKIPÉDIA, [s.d.]) . After incentives from the government initially embodied by Decree No. 101 , of October 31, 1835, the Feijó Decree (a letter of exclusive privilege for the construction and operation for a period of 40 years of railway lines between the States of Rio de Janeiro, Bahia, Minas Gerais, and Rio Grande do Sul), and subsequently by Decree N o. 641 , of July 26, 1852 (BRAZ IL, [s.d.]) (granting of privilege for the construction and ope ration for a period of up to 90 years, exemption of import duties on imported machinery and materials, guarantee of interest on the capital invested, right to expropriate private land and re ceiving free land grants of national areas without economic use, and safeguarded areas), new rail roads were deployed. In the period between the second half of the 19th century and the first half of the 20th century, railroads of different gauges were insta lled in a dispersed way in the Brazilian territory by private and foreign (English) capital companies. The main economic incentive was to meet the needs of urban centers and the ports with agricultural and minerals products coming from the countryside. In Rio de Janeiro, the main railroads built were D. Pedro II and the North Railway , linking Rio de Janeiro to São Paulo. In São Paulo, a network for transporting coffee to the Port of Santos was deployed , includ ing the main connection between Santos to Jundiaí (São Paulo Railway Ltda) and Jundiaí to Campinas (Companhia Paul ista de Estradas de Ferro) , and the", "Sorocabana, Mogiana, Araraquara, and Northwest of Brazil Railways . The latter crosses the current state of Mato Grosso do Sul until the city of Coru mbá on the border with Bolivia. The second railroad implemented in Brazi l was the Recife -Vila do Cabo (The Recife and São Francisco Railway Company), in the Northeast Region of the country, which was later merged with the Recife -Paudalho connection (Great Western) and interconnected with the Bahia to São Francisco railroad , giving origin to the northeast rail network. It was intended mainly to meet the needs of the sugar cane industry and to transport imported manufactured products. The Madeira -Mamoré Railw ay was laid in the Northern Region of the country . The economic function of the railroad was the land transport along the Madeira River of the latex rubber produced in the northern region of Bolivia. With the decline of the international rubber market, the railway succumbed after a truly epic story during its construction due to the difficulties encountered in the jungle where thousands of technicians and workers were decimated by malaria and yellow fever (MUNHOZ, [s.d.]) . In the South Region of the country, several railroad s were laid, such as Porto Alegre -São Leopoldo (Companhia Limitada Estradas de Ferro de Porto Alegre a Nova Hamburgo), Curitiba -Paranaguá, which at the time was considered impossible to execute due to the abyss es, overpasses, and bridges, Mafra -São Francisco do Sul, and Ourinhos -Londrina. According to Munhoz (s.d.) , the policy of government incentives for building railroads has brought conse quences that persist until today, denoting a lack of a long - term strateg y on the part of the imperial government , such as : diversity of gauges, making the operational integration between the railroads difficult ; winding and excessive length pathways ; and the dispersion and isolation between the rail lines . Many passages withou t interconnection were subsequently abandoned and roads were opened to replace them. The lack of a systemic integration of the SBFC lasts until today.", "The government of Getúlio Vargas , at the end of the 1930s , initiated the process of reorganizing the rai lways and promoting investments by taking over foreign and national companies that were in a poor financial situation (MUNHOZ, [s.d.]) . In the beginning of the 1950s, the system totaled 37,000 km long. Eighteen regional railroads were handed over to the administration of RFFSA , created in 1957. Among the main reasons of taking railw ays over by the Union included to avoid the interruption of traffic, prevent u nemployment, provide operational improvements, promote an administrative reorganization, and recover lines and rolling stock (MUNHOZ, [s.d.]) . The state of São Paulo created the Ferrovia Paulista S.A. (FEPASA) in the 1970s to administer approximately 5 ,000 km of railways, subsequently made federal and included in the national privat ization program. In 1984, similar to what was already happening in Europe, the re was the administrative and accounting separation of the cargo and", "urban passenger transport service s, thus excluding RFFSA from urban transport. The Brazilian Company of Urban Transport (CBTU) was responsible for providing urban services. Finally , at the end of the 1990s, the RFFSA privatization process was carried out with the entire rail system being granted to seven concessionaires for a period of 30 years, in most cases, an d the operational assets were leased. The economic rationale for the privatiza tion was to reduce the public operational deficit, attract financial and administrative capital from the private sector, to improve governance, and to increase investment in the rail sector to meet the demand expansion . Furthermore, the Federal Government granted to Vale Company , within its privatization process, the exploitation of the Vitória to Minas and Carajás Rail ways . Subsequently, RFFSA was closed through Decree No. 6 ,018, of January 22, 2007 (BRAZIL, [s.d.] ). Other concessions were granted by the federal government such as Ferrono rte (North Network Railway ) in 1990 and the North -South Railroad in its north stretch in 2004. The current Brazilian network has about 29,000 km with few sections widely used and many almost without use. The Central and South part of the North -South Railwa y, in the centre region of the country, was recently granted to Rumo Logistics in March, 2019 .", "1.1.3 The Role of the Rail Sector in Freight Transport in Brazil", "Brazil has a freight transport matrix that is unbalanced (EPL, 2016) when compared with countries of large territorial dimensions. Road transport has the highest market -share in Brazil, including for lon g distances routes . This imposes high economic and environmental costs, impacting the cost of transportation, the cost of distribution of inputs and of industrial products (the logistic cost), and the emission of pollutants. Figur e 1.1 shows the freight transport matrix in Brazil. Data from Empresa de Planejamento e Logística S.A. (EPL). Created in 2012, EPL is a the state company focused on the Brazilian logistic planning, integrating roadways, railways, ports, airports, and river transport. SFBC covers 15 % of the demand for cargo transportation, while road transport meets 65%. In the United States, for example, the ratio of rail transport in the modal network is approximately 43% and the road transport is approximately 32% (ILOS, [s.d.]) . In Brazil the cost of logistics is estimated at 11.7% of the gross domestic product (GDP) while in the United States it is around 8.3% of the GDP (ILOS, [s.d.]) . The transport (services ) sector in Brazil is responsible for the largest share of CO 2 emissions from the combustion of fuels (46%). The average participation of these emissions from transportation is smaller in t he world, reaching about half of what is registered for Brazil ,", "Figure 1.1: Freight transport matrix i n Brazil, 2015 Source: EPL (2016 ) Figure 1.2 presents the demand transported on railways in 2015 per type of cargo . The demand transported by SFBC, approximate representation of supply, is concentrated in mineral and agricultural bulk, nearly 95% of the to tal. General cargo and liquid bulk represent only 5% of what is transported on the Brazilian rai lways (EPL, 2016) .", "Figure 1.2: Rail sector transport per type of cargo in Brazil, 2015 Source: EPL (2016 )", "The demand for transportation in Brazil, in turn, is diverse, reflecting the country's economic complexity, being the largest portion represented by the transportation of general cargo (1,292 billion tons.km). The relative importance of the type of cargo in the demand for transportation is presented in Figure 1.3.", "Figure 1.3: Transport demand per type of cargo in Brazil, 2015 Source: EPL (2016 ) The ins ertion of the rail modality according to the type of cargo and the comparison with the highway mode of transport is presented in Figure 1.4. The concentration of the rail system in bulk transport is evident. 49% of non -agricultural solid bulk, 30% o f agric ultural solid bulk, and only 1% of general cargo are transported on the Brazilian railways, while highway transport is more diverse, and more focused on general cargo and agricultural bulk . The transport of bulk liquid is performed mostly by the wat erway mode and by pipes, being the most well balanced in the country.", "Figure 1.4: Road, and rail transport market -share per type of cargo in Brazil, 2014 Source: ILOS (s.d.) When focusing on road transport, it can be seen that the consolidated long-distance inter-regional transport along longer routes , with an average length of 1,305 km , using larger capacity vehicles , and with the participation of independent drivers , accounts for 69% of everything that is transported on Brazilian highways . It uses 54% of the diesel consumed in the roadway mode (cargo transportation) in the country (ILOS, [s.d.]) . Figure 1.5 shows the relative production and the relative consumption of diesel fuel depending on the type of road transport.", "Figure 1.5: Ton.km, and diesel consumption per type of the road transport in Brazil, 2014 0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90% 100%general cargonon-agricultural solid bulkagricultural bulkliquid bulk roadways railways", "In Brazil the rail sector concentr ates on hand ling the export of solid bulk with a low diversification of scope where it dedicates about 95% of its offer. Road transportation participates in the handling of solid bulk, but mainly in meeting the internal demand of general cargo for inter -regional long distances. This is where the highest economic costs are concentrated and the largest amount of emission of pollutants from the consumption of diesel are registered . Public policies should attempt to change this reality in the long term in order to balance the Brazilian transport matrix, reducing the cost of transportation, the logistics cost, and the emission of pollutants from the transport sector in the country . In addition to expanding the participation in bulk transport , a new action that le ad to a sign ificant participation of the railway sector in general cargo transportation will be decisive since it has a marginal participation in the main demand for transportation in the country (EPL, 2016) .", "1.2 REFER ENCES", "BAUMOL, W.

In a second stage, a Bootstrap Truncated Regression was used to test the significance of exogenous variables on concessionaire performance: main type of cargo, track gauge, railway operation type (shared infrastruc ture or monopoly), in order to address an important gap in the literature. Secondary data came from the National Land Transport Agency (ANTT). The findings have significance for broad -gauge track commodities transport, while shared - infrastructure operation s had no significance on efficiency, despite regulator incentives. Well directed regulations must encourage concessionaires to increase efficiency, particularly through incentives for agricultural and mineral commodities carried on the broad -gaug e track characteristic of North and Center -West Brazil. Public policies designed to boost cluster efficiency are presented, addressing options such as upsizing, downsizing and resizing inputs, restructuring, best management practices and infrastructure upg rades. Keywords: Efficiency; Railway; Brazil; DEA; Regulation", "2.1 INTRODUCTION", "Due to the continent -sized dimensions of Brazil, cargo transport plays a leading role in lowering transportation costs. It is vital for servicing economic boundaries, increasing th e competit iveness of companies and enhancing the well -being of the population through more affordable access to materials (industrial inputs) and goods. However, the cargo transport matrix is unevenly structured in Brazil, with the road mode accounting fo r some 67% and railways accounting for around only 18% (ILOS, 2014) . There are several reasons behind this situation going back many years, which outside the scope of this paper. It is im portant to stress only that the road mode has higher total costs per unit carried than rail, for long -distance transport of goods (ILOS, 2014) , which is typical in Brazi l. Brazil’ s cargo transport matrix structure holds the entire nation hostage to higher environmental and transport costs than", "countries with better balanced cargo transport matrixes (EPE, 2014) . It is, thus, a matter of strategic importance for Brazil to achi eve an eve n balance for its transport mode matrix from the standpoint of the competitiveness of its companies and of the transport industry as a whole, lowering their overall CO2 emissions (JITSUZUMI; NAKAMURA, 2010) . It will be important to make good use of potential reductions in outlays on logistics (freight fees, inventory, cargo handling costs and overhead) resultin g from mor e intensive use of alternative means of transport with greater cargo unit capacity (railways and waterways) to service new economic frontiers in the Center -West, North and Northeast Regions, as well as areas with more mature economies.", "For the tr ansport in frastructure to function efficiently, its operations must be efficient in terms of sector -specific benchmarks. Thus, when presenting the topic of this survey – the cargo -carrying efficiency of Brazilian rail concessionaires – one must address the developme nt of the Brazilian economy. For comparative measurements of concessionaire efficiency, a commonly used technique was used, which is Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) (ILOS, 2008; MARKOVITS -SOMOGYI, 2011; WANKE; BARROS, 2015a) . The model allows comparative assessments to be made of a set of Decision -Making Units (DMUs), to see which of them are on the efficiency boundary of the production possibili ty set and thus benchmarks for other inefficient DMUs. From a methodological standpoint, this paper contributes in the second stage with an analysis using Bootstrap Truncated Regression (see Methodology) of the significance of contextual variable s in DMU p erformance. The selected variables are ‘predominant cargo’ (agricultural commodities, mineral commodities or assorted cargo), track gauge (broad or metric) and ‘type of operation’ (shared infrastructure or monopoly). This paper seeks to shed ligh t on the c onditions that would boost the efficiency of Brazilian rail transport by evaluating, among other aspects, whether the regulatory incentives designed to boost competition offered by the ANTT after 2011 (see on Brazilian Rail Freight Context) — particularly shared track use — have been significant for DMU efficiency, which is the main gap in the literature. Proposed public policies focused on groups of concessionaires (clusters) with similar performances are presented.", "The reminder of this paper is organized as follows. Initially, in Section 2.2, the Brazilian Rail Freight Context is presented. Section 2.3 shows a review of the literature on railway efficiency, indicating the gap in the literature. Section 2.4 describes the methodology used to analyz e the data. Section 2.5 comprises a detailed description of the database and our findings, including the sig nificance levels of the selected contextual variables on DMU efficiency. Additionally, rail concessionaires are clustered by performance and a propo sal is made for", "public policies (item 2.5.4), and outliers are discussed (item 2.5.5). Section 2.6 concludes the discussion and presents the constraints of the survey , and suggestions for future projects focused on the development of Brazil’s rail freight sector.", "2.2 BRAZILIAN RAIL FREIGHT CONTEXT", "Although Brazil’s rail freight network is around 29,000 km long (ANTT, 2015) , it is used unevenly because while some se gments carry heavy traffic every day, others are underutilized, if at all. Twelve concessionaires operate th is network under a concession model that is controlled by the private sector from standpoint of the capital ownership. A minority share of capital i s owned by the public sector (in America Latina Logística S.A., merged with Rumo Logistics S.A. in 2015, 8%; Vale, 5%; and VLI, holding that controls FCA and FNS, 16%), though this does not affect capital control. This private sector control was firmed up through the concession award process for rail transport systems in Brazil between 1996 and 1999 (MARCHETTI; FERREIRA, 2012) .", "As to concess ionaire performance, how is this impacted by the regulatory environment? More than half of the concessionaires haul mainly agricultural commodities and ores (ANTF, 201 5; ANTT, 2015) . The predominant track gauge is metric (58% of the DMUs) and 25% of the DMUs in the sample operate shared infrastructure with other operators. The concessionaires are clustered mainly in South and Southeast Brazil (58%). Furthermore, most (74%) of the cargo carried on the system is considered tied to the rail s ector (i.e., not subject to economic competition from other means of transport). Mineral commodities are particularly important (iron ore, other ores and coal) (ANTF, 201 5). Transportation of agricultural commodities (soybeans, soy bran, and maize), although typically carried by rail, is open to competition from other haulage opt ions, especially the road mode with its economic and environmental externalities.", "The key regulatory framework consists of provisions set forth in the concession agreements, supplemented by resolutions published by the National Land Transport Agency (ANTF, 201 5; ANTT, 2015; ILOS, 2008; MARCHETTI; FERREIRA, 2012; WANKE; BARROS, 2015a) . Some operating indicators present growth rates higher than those of the Brazilian economy fo r the period (ANTF, 201 5). Important indicators include transport output in useful tons x kilometers (TKU), investments (in Brazi lian reais), reduced rate of accidents (number of acci dents recorded by number of trains and kilometers travelled) and cargo shipped in useful tons (TU). However, from 2011 onwards, the regulatory framework for the Brazilian rail sector was gradually alter ed in an attempt to include provisions for competition in the", "network, in order to provide users with greater benefits. Outstanding efforts include the removal of regulatory obstacles to facilitate the penetration of rail concessionaires into third -party networks, the setting of new contractual production (TK U), and safety targets and, subsequently, implementation of a methodology for calculating the rates to haul each type of cargo (MARCHETTI; FERREIRA, 2012 ). Resolutions promulgated by the ANTT in 2011 supplies for the concession system and encourage intra -mode competition; this can be achieved mainly through regulating mutual traffic and right -of-way operations and setting segment production targets for each concessionaire to allow t hird-party use of idle capac ity. The modifications to the regulatory framework fostered competition in the network while curtailing the monopolistic powers of the incumbents, culminating in Decree Nº 8 ,129, promulgated on October 23, 2013, which establishe d the policy of free access to the federal rail sub-system, based on the European model (BOGNETTI; FAZIOLI, 1999; KUMBHAKAR et al., 2007; LOIZIDES; TSIONAS, 2002) . Rail sector regulations made provision for separating the concessions for operating rail infrastructure and the rendering of rail transport services. Viewed a s a whole, the regulations altered the organizational structure of rail operations from a monopoly regulated by segments to a contestable market with no barriers to entry, despite the existence of the economies of scale that are typical of natural monopoli es and the multiplicity of services in the network.", "The alterations being implemented suggest that the grantor authority was dissatisfied with the results of the administrative mechanisms put in place by the rail concessionaires . These included the exercis e of monopolistic power in price management, control of supply quantities, and quality of service at a level often harmful to users. Although disputed by operators, these conditions were the principal reason for removing barrier s to entry for new operators (MARCHETTI; FERREIRA, 2012 ). Concerns built up regarding whether the assessment of these matters was scientific and whether the selected remedy (regulatory actions) was the right choice for boosting the effic iency of Brazilian rail frei ght operations.", "In this context, we present the main questions underpinning the proposal to generate expertise: How efficient are cargo -carrying rail concessionaires in Brazil? Which operators are on the efficiency frontier? What exogenous factors affect t he efficiency of these companies? Do shared -infrastructure operations impact concessionaire efficiency? What public policies could be adopted to boost efficiency? This survey seeks to solve a practical problem for the Brazilian economy by delineating the c onditions needed to boost rail freight efficiency and thereby enable lower transport costs in the supply chain of products being transported in Brazil.", "Table 2.1 presents the rail concessionaires that constitute the sample for this survey. In addition, the predominant car go, rail network track gauges, regions serviced by each of the concessionaires and type of operation, whether shared infrastructure (with more than one operator) or monopoly (exclusive to a single operator) are listed. Concessionaires with shared operation s addressed by this survey were ALL.P, which encompasses the operations of ALL.N, MRS and FCA; the EFC, which includes the operations of FNS; and FNS, which encompasses the operations of VALEC, handled by VLI on behalf of VALEC.", "2.3 LITERATURE REVIEW", "Several surveys of analysis of transport system operating performance have been conducted using the non -parametric DEA model.

On ly five studies (7%), however, were conduct ed in South America, the majority being focused on Europe, Asia and North America. The inputs used were selected mainly from labor (employees) and capital (production equipment) factors. The outputs normally emplo yed refer to operating results and/or finan cial earnings of transport companies (MARKOV ITS-SOMOGYI, 2011) .", "Focusing on rail infrastructure and the methods employed by researchers, George and Rangaraj (2008) used super -efficiency DEA (SDEA) to assess the performance of railway zones in the Indian network in terms of the best -performing zon es and efficiency trends. Yu (2008) , Yu and Lin (2008) and Doomernick (2015) used the network DEA (NDEA) approach to assess production efficiency, service efficacy, and efficacy of 40 European railway systems, 20 passenger and cargo railways selected from all over the world, and the high -speed passenger transport systems of Asia and Europe, respectively. Efficient input deployment was compared with system efficacy using the production and service provider models. T he production phase output was construed as input for the service provider phase in the model proposed by the authors; moreover, the efficacy of the systems is viewed as the final outcome between the two evaluation models. Through the NDEA, Yu (2008) and Y u and Lin (2008) felt that the methodology offered greater insights into the sources of inefficiency for purposes of upgrading system performance. Doomernick (2015) found the most efficient systems in the sample, together with the factors contributing to h igh output performance.", "Shi, Lim and Chi (2 011) et al., Guzm án and Montoya (2011) , Kabakasal , Kutlar and Sarikaya (2013) and Doomernick (2015) not only analyzed efficiency scores using DEA or NDEA models to assess progress in productivity among railways in the US and Spain: they also looked at sele cted railways elsewhere in the world and high -speed rail passenger transport systems, respectively, by analyzing the progression of the Malmquist Index. Management productivity and technical efficiency gains were also examined during the period under analy sis. Shi , Lim and Chi (2011) examined the productivity gain factors for each US railway, concluding that the leader was Burlington Northern Santa Fe (BNSF) followed by Union Pacific (UP). Guzman and Montoya (2011) analyzed the gains in productivity among S panish railways that would explain the corporate movements subsequent to the period under analysis. Kabakasal , Kutlar and Sarikaya (2013) studied the efficiency scores of 31 railway companies worldwide and conclud ed that total factor productivity (Malmquis t Index) increases by only 0.03% for the entire period analyzed.", "Oum , Pathomsir i and Yoshida (2013) used the non -parametric Directional Output Distance F unction (DO DF) method together with compound social efficien cy indicators to assess DMU efficiency, concluding that railways are socially more efficient than airlines. The classic DEA (CCR and BCC) models were used by Bil (2013) , Hilmola (2007) and Bhanot and Singh (2014). Bil (2013) evaluated the overestimation of efficiency scores through DEA models, Pareto efficiency analyses, and the assurance region method, finding that the results are sensitive to the models used but probably have no major impact on the final con clusions (efficiency rankings). Hilmola (2007) assessed the efficiency of European railways and their adaptation to shrinking demands, concluding that railways in the Baltic nations Estonia and Latvia are the most efficient for cargo transport. Bhanot and Singh (2014) presented the performance indicator s for Indian railways carrying containers in the period following the lifting of the monopoly held by the CONCOR state -owned enterprise. They found lower efficiency of the state -owned company during the perio d under analysis.", "Several researchers have analy zed the relationship between the variables used to explain efficiency scores. Hilmola (2011) used a linear regression after applying the DEA model and analyzed the relationship between the efficiency scores o f the public transport system and the extent of use of individual transportation (automobiles) in major cities. He found a significant relationship between low automobile use and higher efficiency values for public transport systems. Kutlar , Kabasakal and Sarikaya (2013) used the Tobit Regression to che ck which DEA model outputs were significant for the efficiency scores found in the DEA CCR and DEA BCC models, finding that the outputs were more significant in terms of explaining allocative efficiency. Chen (2014) analyzed the efficiency of the Freeway B us Service industry in Taiwan (FBS) after the arrival of the Taiwan High -Speed Rail system (THSR), assessing the significance of several contextual variables on the scores with a Tobit Regression. Chen found that the arrival of THSR improved the long term efficiency of the FBS, despite the decline of industry competitiveness since 2007 (motivated by technological changes), the significance of market -share, and the increase in management outlays on the performa nce of incumbents. Kabakasal , Kutlar and Sarikay a (2013) , in his turn, utilized a Panel Regression to analyze the influence of DEA models on the output variable, concluding that CCR models provide more meaningful explanations for some output variables than BCC models. Also through the Tobit Regression, Wanke and Barros (2015a) inves tigated the effects of contextual variables (location and cargo type) on the efficiency scores found in the Brazilian rail freight industry using Distance Friction Minimization (DFM). They concluded that regu latory authorities must consider two groups of c ompanies in terms of funding with different interest rates for", "infrastructure investments: one focused on iron ore transport and the other on hauling agricultural commodities and general containerized cargo.", "Additional parametric methods have been used to assess railway efficiency. Bogart and Chaudhary (2013) , Crafts , Mills and Mulatu (2007) used Total Factor Productivity (TFP). Bogart and Chaudhary (2013) measured Indian railway growth between 1874 -1912, conc luding that had surpassed the expansion of Ameri can, British and Spanish railways. Crafts , Mils and Mulatu (2007) analyzed the productivity of British railways between 1852 and 1912, finding management problems related to collusion and entry barriers. Leun ig, Mulatu and Crafts (2008) , in another study, utilized TFP to assess whether British railways were well -managed at the beginning of the twentieth century. They concluded that rail companies were not well - managed a hundred years ago and were hampered by c osts inefficiencies and low growth of TFP levels . Neither competition nor regulation were effective. Dodgson (2011) used TFP to analyze the productivity of British railways between 1893 -1912 in a disaggregated model (locomotives, wagons, permanent way and traffic), concluding that productivity growth in the period was slow, despite the growth in transport in the first decade of the twentieth century and additional consumption of inputs. Couto and Graham (2008) used Stochastic Frontier Analysis (SFA) to anal yze the efficiency of the European railway indus try between 1972 -1999, finding an average efficiency loss of 15% due to rising costs from technical (6.5%) and allocative (7%) inefficiency. Kumb hakar et al. (2007) utilized Latent Class Model (LCM) and panel data of 17 European railways between 1971 -1974, claiming the input orientation model (cost function approach) is to be preferred after the European directives to increase profits and reduce losses (in 1984, decentralized methods of management by sector, s eparating accounts and costs of each business se gment and, in 1991, competitive access to infrastructure based on the principle of vertical disintegration between infrastructure and operations). They found the input model to be more appropriate in countrie s such as Spain, Portugal, Greece and Ireland, w hile the output orientation model (revenue function approach) is more suited to railways in Switzerland, Luxembourg, Norway, Denmark and Sweden. Loizides and Tsionas (2002) proposed a General Index to assess the evolution of the productivity of 10 European railways between 1969 -1992, including special circumstances between different countries in the sample (economies of scale, regulatory restrictions, etc.), not considered in the TFP model. For that reason, Lo izides and Tsionas (2002) utilized a Seemingly U nrelated Regression (SUR) using different coefficients for each railway. The results showed a declining trend. Only German and British railways showed a positive evolution (technical change), while the others generally presented room for improvement in ter ms of productivity.", "Some authors have compared parametric with non -parametric methods. Graham (2008) , for instance, compared efficiency scores with DEA and TFP, noting a similarity between the efficiency rat ings, despite differences in terms of economies of scale among urban rail companies. Technological elements that comprise firm -specific technology include system control types, economic vibrancy of the city, and population density, all of which influence t he productivity of urban rail companies. Others authors sought to interpret inefficiency sources and have devised methods to optimize subsidy levels and assess the relationship between subsidy and efficiency. Concerned about the cuts to productivity incent ives in subsidized companies and the struggle fo r financial support caused by increasing energy and labor costs, Mallikarjun , Lewis and Sexton (2014) applied a non -oriented NDEA to assess the efficiency of 24 public rail systems in the US during 2001 -2010. To evaluate the relationship between inefficien cy and subsidy, Mallikarjun , Lewis and Sexton (2014) utilized a censored Tobit Regression and a Generalized Least Squares (GLS) Regression with bootstrapping in order to address concerns regarding non paramet ric efficiency scores. It turned out that highly subsidized systems were, on average, less efficient in terms of operational costs and revenues than less subsidized systems. In other words, there is a statically significant negative relationship between ef ficiency and subsidy in the sample studied. Jits uzumi and Nakamura (2010) used DEA in conjunction with the cost -efficiency model suggested by Far rell (1957) and Debreu (2012) to analyze the causes of inefficiency in Japanese railways. They proposed a method to calculate the optimum level of subsidy to c ompensate for regional disparities. They found that some railways had received subsidies beyond the values presented by the pr oposal model, suggesting that the methodology could benefit public authorities.", "Table 2 .2 presents the literature review.", "Table 2 .2:", "Literature Review .", "Author (s) and year Purpose of the Study #DMUs Method (s) Country of the Study Inputs mentioned Outputs Mentioned Contextual Variables George, S.

However, such sur veys of Latin America are sparse, perhaps justified by the smalle r relative share held by the rail mode in the transport matrixes of these countries. We believe our assessment of the efficiency of rail concessionaires in Brazil through classic DEA CCR and DEA BCC models, followed by a Bootstrap Truncated Regression at a second stage, constitutes a methodological structure never before used to assess the efficiency of Brazilian rail concessionaires and the impact of selected contextual variables on operator performance. Moreover, the significance of the type of operation (shared infrastructure or monopoly) on concessionaire performance after the process to foster competition in the rail network implemented by ANTT in 2011 onwards, has also not been explored a nd therefore represents a gap in the literature. Importantly, the answers to the questions listed earlier (i.e., What is the efficiency of railway cargo concessionaires in Brazil? Which operators are on the efficiency borderline? What exogenous factors aff ect corporate efficiency? Do shared infrastructure operations imp act concessionaire efficiency? What public policies could be adopted to boost efficiency?) also constitute findings that could contribute to the formulation of specific public policies for th e improved efficiency in Brazil’s rail freight sector. Finally, t he paper differs from Wanke and Barros (2015a) in two major aspects. The first relates to methodological framework; the second, the analysis of efficiency of the DEA models combined with scale efficiency (S E) and the type of return to scale (RTS) of the DM Us, thus allowing concessionaires to be divide d into specific homogeneous groups (clusters) with public policies targeting each of them, moving ahead in terms of the proposals presented in (WANKE; BARROS, 2015a) .", "2.4 METHODOLOGY", "The methodology is structured into three sections.

The purpose of DEA models is to identify and measure relative effic iencies among several production units, Decision -Making Units, defined through efficiency scores. The methodology applies linear programming methods to construct a non -parametric frontier for the data, where efficiency measurements are estimated in relatio n to the frontier (COOPER; SEIFORD; TONE, 2006) . The linear programming model seeks to maximize unit efficiency, expressed as the ratio between outputs and thei r respective weights and inputs and their respective weights, by comparing the efficiency of the specific unit with the performan ce of a group of similar units. Units attaining 100% are rated as efficient and serve as peers for those scoring less than 100% . Efficient DMUs (score = 1) will necessarily be located on the production possibility frontier.

It measures the impact of scale size on DMU productivity operations, or the abi lity to generate more outputs per inputs used. When the SE ratio is equal to 1, the DEA CCR and DEA BCC model efficiency scores coincide (RTS is constant) and the DMU operates at the optimum scale. If 0 ≤ SE < 1, the operations scale is inefficient. The sc ale inefficiency is given by the expression [(1-SE)/100]. Efficiency measured through the DEA CCR model (overall technic al efficiency) may be broken down into efficiency measured through the DEA BCC model (pure technical efficiency) and scale efficiency (S E) (BOG ETOFT; OTTO, 2011) .", "There are different ways to define the type of the RTS (SEIFORD; ZHU, 1999) . The return to scale may be defined through an inspection of the sum of the weights [ 𝜆] resulting from the DEA CCR model for each DMU. If the sum of the weights attributed by the DEA CCR mod el to each of the DMUs is 1, the scale returns are constant; this is called the Most Productive Scale Size (MPSS). Should this sum be less than 1, tha n the RTS is increasing (Increasing Return to Scale or IRS) and the scale efficiency is rated as sub -optim um.

The results of this regression is called the second stage of DEA model evaluation. It is worthwhile noting that Banker and Natajaran (2008) proposed another estimate based on the square minimu ms method. The parametric regression proposed by Simar and Wilson (2000) tests the significance o f exogenous contextual variables in the efficiency scores assigned by the DEA models, using a specific confidence interval (5%). The technique consists of simu lating a new sample distribution through a data generation process using the DEA scores.

There is considerable asymmetry among the rail concessionair es, as indicated by the gap between the minimum (0.037) and maximum (1.000 ) efficiency in the DEA CCR model, with constant returns of scale. The mean overall technical efficiency is low (0.309) for the DMU group analyzed. This suggests a mean overall ineff iciency of 69.1% for the system, indicating that rail concessionaires must be encouraged to step up production (TKU million) in order to operate at the efficiency frontier. Also notable is the fact that the mean efficiency found in the DEA BCC model (0.383 ), with variable returns to scale, reflects a mean management inefficiency of 61.7% for production management, based on the inputs used. This management inefficiency outstrips the mean inefficiency found in the operations scale (14%). The results suggest t hat, on average, management inefficiency is more important than DMU scale inefficiency when we try to explain the mean overall technical inefficiency found in the DEA CCR model (69.1%).

Concessionaire EFC specializes in the transport of mineral commodities (ores), mainly in the North Region, on broad gauge and with shared infrastructure from Açailândia to Itaqui Port, both in Maranhão State, where it receives trains of the FNS or VALEC (VLI) concessionaires. The efficiency frontier in the DEA BCC model, represented by convex linear combinations of the produ ction possibilities set, with variable returns of scale, consists of 10% of the DMUs in the sample (six DMUs). Two D MUs garnered an efficiency score equal to one in the DEA CCR model, thus operating with an SE rated as optimum, and four DMUs were ranked as efficient in the DEA BCC model (albeit inefficient in the DEA CCR model) with sub-optimum SE (concessionaires EFC a nd F.OES). The EFC concessionaire presented an SE that is very close to the scale efficiency rated as optimum in 2011, 2012 and 2014 (0.958, 0.957 and 0.944, respectively) and had outputs among the highest in the sample (99,567, 103,399 and 104,177 TKU mil lion, respectively). In contrast, concessionaire F.OES presented the lowest SE but one in the sample (0.414) and a very low output (209 TKU million, the sixth lowest in the sample). These results undermine the unfeasibility of this side of the efficiency f rontier. Despite proportionally efficient output compared to low input levels, this DMU (F.OES) cannot be", "taken as a benchmark for other ine fficient DMUs, due to the low output. Concessionaire F.OES is a monopoly carrying agricultural commodities on metric gauge track in Southern Brazil. Table 2.7 separates the inefficient concessionaires in quartiles, as proposed by Kumar and Gulati (2008) . This is the first step in grouping the concessionaires by similar performance, which will be presented in more detai l in 5.4. The quartiles are classified as “Most Inefficient” (Category 1); “Below Mean Efficiency” (Category 2); “Above Mean Efficiency” (Ca tegory 3); and “Marginally Inefficient” (Category 4). The DEA CCR model scores were used here as they are more restr ictive than those of the DEA BCC model and generally do not exceed the scores found in the DEA BCC model (COOPER; SEIFORD; TONE, 2006) .

The type of opera tion (shared infrastructure) variable was not significant to explain DMU efficiency in the confidence interval used. These results corroborate the findings of the DEA BC C model, where efficient DMUs have the predominant characteristic of carrying all commo dities and operating on broad gauge tracks. Agricultural and mineral cargoes are well suited to rail freight and can be carried in large volumes on long trains, ensuring better use of inputs, economies of scale and lower operating costs. The results sugges t the importance of economies of scale for the efficiency of operations.", "Operating with shared infrastructure did not appear as a significant variable for operator effic iency scores, despite regulatory incentives. This suggests that transport operations on more competitive structures, with more than one operator, did not influence DMU performance in the sample analyzed. The predominant cargo type and rail gauge proved mor e relevant than the market structure of the operations. Bearing in mind the sample used , operations on shared permanent rail were not confirmed as an element enhancing operator efficiency. It still remains to be discovered whether monopoly operations (sing le permanent rail operator) are significant for DMU efficiency. Further studies must be conducted in order to assess the significance of monopolistic operations including new variables in the DEA models, for example, which could encompass gains in scale fo r operating costs or the tariff/km prices of shared and monopolist operations (undesira ble output).", "2.5.4 Public Policies", "Figure 2 clusters the rail concessionaires with similar characteristics through the joint analysis of the efficiency of the BTR results and RTS of the DMUs of the sample.

These objectives are presented below. Group I (“upsizing”), characterized by efficiency above the m ean and IRS, has a greater need f or increased inputs (wagons and labor) and other operating assets (such as terminals and rail access) in order to expand the scope of their activities. Group II (“efficiency measures+upsizing”), characterized by efficiency below mean and IRS, requires, tog ether, improvement of management practices (production management) and tracking of infrastructure upgrades (to boost assets turnover) in addition to expanding new inputs and operating assets. Stand -alone measures will not b e able to offset the various sour ces of inefficiency. Group III (“combination of best inputs and/or downsizing”), characterized by efficiency above mean and DRS, requires firm steps to reduce inputs and/or ensure a more even balance in their combination (f or the more efficient members of the Group). Group IV (“efficiency measures+downsizing”), characterized by efficiency below the mean and DRS, requires joint steps to attain better management practices, track infrastructure upgrades and lower inputs. Group E (“efficient”) consisted of a si ngle concessionaire that is the benchmark for others, is less dependent on incentives in terms of the scale of its activities, better management practices or tracking of infrastructure upgrades. Discussion of incentives to continue activities at a rate com mensurate with rising demand still remains. Rail sector financing mechanisms may tailor their financial support policies to each of the proposed groups in order to enhance concessionaire efficiency, while also pursuing grea ter efficiency in the allocation of their proper resources. For instance, special financial conditions for upsizing (Group I) and for improvements in management and infrastructure (Groups II and IV). The results of the influence of the contextual variable s on DMU efficiency indicate that it is important to emphasize the feasibility of the conditions needed for operators to handle the transport of agricultural and mineral commodities on broad gauge systems, which are characteristic of the rail corridors in North and Center -West Brazil. How ever, mechanisms for increased competition in the rail network have not yet resulted in enhanced efficiency among DMUs operating shared tracks. The conclusions suggest that DMUs on Groups II and IV, with efficiency below th e mean and carrying mainly assort ed cargo on metric gauge tracks, are the ones most exposed to regulatory competitive pressures and the arrival of more efficient new operators.", "2.5.5 Analysis of Outliers", "Outliers are firms that differ from others in terms of the set of production possibilities for some specific reason and can have a significant impact on DEA models (BOGETOFT; OTTO, 2011) . The presence of outliers has been a concern i n the DEA literature over the past three decades due to the limitations of classic models, since there has been no clear definition as to how to identify outliers in DEA models (KHEZRIMOTLAGH, 2013) . One possible indicator of the presence of an outlier (or group of outliers) is a sharp drop in efficiency scores obtained from selected DMUs (BOGETOFT; OTTO, 2011) . Part of this problem may derive from the presence of slacks, with efficiency scores not taken into account in cla ssic DEA models. Bogetoft and Ott o (2011) provide some reasons for the presence of outliers: (a) error in the database; (b) correct, albeit atypical observations (high leverage points); and (c) observations that suggest low or high performance in efficienc y scores. In addition, Khezrimotl agh (2013) points to the following as causes of outliers: (a) the presence on non - homogeneous DMU among observations; and (b) the presence of “Near and Far Dat a”, 'when one DMU uses a much greater (bit less) value of input and only produces a bit greater ( much less) value of output’. As a precautionary measure, extreme observations, that are hard to replicate, can be classified as outliers. However, parsimony should be considered in the treatment of outliers, since these ext reme observations can also repres ent the best adopted business practices or new technological practices used that expand the efficiency frontier, making the DMU(s) a reference for the others.", "2.5.5.1 Identification of Outliers", "Figure 2.3 below shows the scatterplo t of the variables considered in the efficiency evaluation of Brazilian railway sector concessionaires according to Table 3. The most productive DMU (TKU million) are possible outlier candidates (EFC in all the years considered in the sample), as suggested by the TKU million x wagons grap h. The boxplot in Figure 4 reinforces this possibility, since it indicates the highest values as outliers (as attained by concessionaire EFC).", "Figure 2.3: Scatterplot of the variables used in the DEA modeling", "Figure 2.4: Box plot, histogram and density plot of output (TKU million) 2.5.5.2 Impact on the DEA Models, BTR Regression and Composition of Clusters Figure 2.5 below shows the density of the efficiency results of the DMUs in the various models used, considering the sample both with and without the outlier s.

There is greater uniformity of results when outliers are removed.", "Figure 2.5: Comparison of the effici ency results obtained in classical DEA models (CCR, BCC) and in BTR regressions (crs and vrs), with and without outliers The results of the BTR using the sample without outliers are shown in Tables 2.11 and 2.12 below.

The migration of DMU ALL.S in years 2013 and 2014 from Group II to Group IV reinforces the need to cut inputs and make improvements in administration and infrastructure.

Mean eff DEA CCR = 0.46; mean eff BTR (crs) = 0.43 (without outliers). In the present case, the importance of the outliers in the benchmarking analysis is recognized. The DMU EFC is controlled by the Vale mining company. Vale operates a rail corridor that is part of a logistics chain for exporting mi neral commodities in a competitive market. The efficiency of this logistics chain is critical to Vale maintaini ng competitive export capacity. For this purpose, the company uses both operational and technological techniques to obtain superior results, incl uding long compositions (300 wagons), automatic discharge wagons (to reduce the transit time of the composition s in cargo loading and unloading), eliminating railroad crossings (for greater freight speed), high power AC locomotives (for greater traction), as well as favorable locational factors of the rail (favorable longitudinal topography of permanent rail). Main taining the EFC in the entire DMU sample set is important, precisely to expand the efficiency frontier through operational and technological prac tices of reference for the other DMUs.", "2.6 CONCLUSIONS", "The mean efficiency of Brazilian rail concessionaires as a g roup is low, not exceeding 38.3%. It may be inferred that the Brazilian rail system generally operates with an excess of inputs (wagons in circul ation and labor) and/or low output (TKU million). This suggests that the mean inefficiency of the system is 61. 7%. Therefore, concessionaires can boost production (TKU million), without increasing inputs, to attain frontier efficiency for their operations. To some extent, these findings are not surprising, in view of the criticism of efficiency of Brazil’s rail con cessionaires as a group (described in this paper). Although not homogeneous in terms", "of the scope of their activities (inputs) and performance, m ost of these companies operate with low overall technical efficiency, far from the efficiency frontier. This ca lls for management actions by the grantor authority to implement regulatory measures to enhance firm performance. Another noteworthy aspect is th at the mean management inefficiency (61.7%) measured using the DEA BCC model is higher than the mean inefficien cy found in SE of the operations (14%). Analyzed in a second stage via BTR methodology, the effects of the contextual variables on DMU performanc e lead to the conclusion that transporting predominantly agricultural and mineral commodities on broad gauge tr acks are significant variables in DMU efficiency scores, considering constant and variable returns to scale. Operations on shared infrastructure, with more than one operator, did not prove significant for DMU efficiency, despite recent regulatory incentive s. The findings also suggest that it is important to ensure the feasibility of conditions required for concessionaires to handle shipments of agr icultural and mineral commodities on broad gauge systems, which are characteristic of rail corridors in North and Center -West Brazil.", "Public policies designed to enhance efficiency must address clusters of concessionaires with similar performance, promotin g regulatory incentives and offering different types of financing. Group I (“upsizing”) has the greatest need f or measures for expanding activities (more inputs and operating assets). Group II (“efficiency measures + upsizing”) requires improved management practices for production control, infrastructure upgrades (faster asset turnover) and expansion of operations. Group III (“best inputs combination and/or downsizing”) requires fewer inputs and a better balanced combination (for the most efficient in this Group) while maintaining output. Group IV (“efficiency measures + downsizing”) requires better management pract ices, infrastructure upgrades, and incentives to reduce inputs. Finally, Group E (“efficient”) consists of only a single concessionaire (EFC), a benchmark for the others, that requires fewer regulatory and financing (interest rate) incentives, and more sup port for maintaining efficiency conditions attuned to rising demands. The conclusions also suggest that the concessionaires in Groups II and IV, characterized by efficiency below the mean and predominantly hauling assorted cargo on metric gauge tracks, are the ones most exposed to regulatory competitive pressures and the arrival of more efficient new operators. The conclusions were supported by a r obustness analysis of the effects of outliers in the benchmarking analysis.", "This survey focused on solving a pr actical problem in the Brazilian economy:", "exploring the conditions to enhance rail freight efficiency, paving the way for better integration of rail in the supply chain of a wide range of products. In addition to addressi ng the theoretical", "gap, these concl usions could also contribute to the formulation of cluster -specific public policies designed to boost efficiency in Brazil’s rail freight sector. This survey was limited to the data available in the ANTT database. However , further studies are required, for example, comparing the performance of Brazilian rail concessionaires with operators elsewhere in the world, by extending the database. The significance of other contextual variables on concessionaire performance is also relevant. An analysis must be made of efficiency along critical segments of DMUs where demands are reaching track capacity, in order to discover which sub -segments are the most efficient and which require increased capacity and further investments. All of these studies can offer important c ontributions to the development of the rail freight sector in Brazil.", "2.7 REFERENCES", "ANTF. Balanço do Transporte Ferroviário de Cargas 2014.

It is increasingly adopted in social sciences but according to our best knowledge used for the first tim e to aggregate and contrast findings on rail tran sport efficiency. The experiment adopted a permutation test to evaluate the influence of variables discussed in the literature in the mean efficiency scores. The results suggest that railways located in Japa n and in the US have characteristics that push th em toward increasing efficiency. The passenger rail systems reached significantly higher estimates than conventional cargo systems. Estimates from parametric and nonparametric models showed significant diffe rence, while from nonparametric models including Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) and from Network DEA did not. The number of variables and the ratio between the number of decision making units and the number of variables employed significantly influenced t he scores. Unexpectedly, different data structure s did not. Validation methods are presented. Public policies based on the empirical results are commented.", "Keywords : Efficiency; rail systems; railways; meta -analysis; permutation test.", "3.1 INTRODUCTION", "The indu strial revolution brought profound changes in transport systems. The steam engine (1765) introduced the rail system (RODRIGUE; COMTOIS; SLACK, 2013) . The steam technology was commercially adopted for the transportation of coal between Manchester and Liverpool (1830). Railroads were then built in England, Western Europe, and North America. In the late 19th century, 130,000 km of railways were laid in the United States. Its r apid development can be confused with the country itself. Transcontinental railway lines were built: New York to San Francisco (1869), Trans -Canadian Railway (1886), and Trans -Siberian Railway (1904). The first railway built in Japan dates to 1872. With th e improvement of the engines, the railways developed worldwide during the 20th century. Cities sprung up along the railways. Rail services became specialized. The growth of the urban population led to the", "const ruction of subway systems. However, the develo pment of highways reduced the relative importance of the conventional rail system. The more intense use of the automobile in the cities and the urban sprawl (HARRISON, C. AND DONNELLY, 2011) brought unsustainable economic, social, and environmental costs. But the high -speed rail ( HSR) technology in the sixties reinvented rail transport. Its first appearance was in Japan (Shinkansen) from Tokyo to Osaka (1964). Later in France (Train à Grande Vitesse – TGV) from Paris to Lyons (1981), and later in several other European countries, f ully compatible with existing railways (RODRIGUE; COMTOIS; SLACK, 2013; UIC, [s.d.]) . The value of new economic factors also favoured railway transport: restriction of the use of fossil fuels and of the emission of greenhouse gases (GHG), cost reduction initiatives, improved quality of life in an urban environment, and intermodalism (RODRIGUE; COMTOIS; SLACK, 2013) .", "The expansion of railroads reached its height in the 20th century but remains in expansion. Almost 29% of the world’s railway network is installed in Europe and is dedicated to passenger transportation, due to policies of continent integration and reduction of GHG emissions, and freight transportation, resulting from polices to encourage competition (WHEAT; NASH, 2006) . It handles 16% of the global passenger demand, notably in France, Germany, and UK, and 6% of the global freight demand, especially in Ukraine and German y. Twenty -six percent is located in Asia and Oce ania where the greatest productivity is observed (in the railway sector, the average traffic intensity of the railway track is commonly used as a measure of the railway’s productivity and is represented by th e relation of the traffic intensity [in million passenger.km] per the railway length [in km]) . It handles 77% of the passenger demand, influenced by the Indian, Chinese, and Japanese markets, and 35% of freight demand, mainly in China and India. Thirty per cent is found in Brazilian, Canadian, and North -American networks, and is focused almost exclusively for carrying cargo. It represents 32% of the global freight transport but only 1% of the passenger market -share. The US is recognized for operating over lo ng average transport distance of freight (ATDF). In the railway sector, ATDF is commonly used as a measure of the mean distance travelled by cargo and is represented by traffic intensity [ton.km] per the quantity of cargo carried [ton]. The HSR technology is present mainly in Asia (75%) and in Europe (2 4%). The HSR traffic intensity is remarkable in Asia, especially in China and Japan, then in Europe, especially in France and in Germany. The highest productivity level is found in Japan, then the Taipei -Kaoh siung line, South Korea, France, and next German y. Figure 3.1 summarizes the characteristics and performance indicators of the railways. Data from International Union of Railways (UIC). Created in 1922, UIC is a worldwide organisation to promote rail trans port. Appendix A presents the data.", "Figure 3.1: Railways and HSR technology indicators Sources: UIC (s.d, 2015) , complemented by the authors. Units in brackets. Americas: Brazil, Canada, and US.", "There have been several studies in literature involving the efficiency frontier analysis of the railway tr ansport systems of cargo and passengers between 2000 and 2016. They are shown in subsection 2. Although studies with meta -regression have already eval uated the effect of different variables on the technical efficiency (BRONS et al., 2005; KABASAKAL; KUTLAR; SARIKAYA, 2013; ODE CK; BRÅTHEN, 2012; THIAM; BRAVO -URETA; RIVAS, 2001) , to our best knowledge it is the first time meta -analysis is used to aggregate and contrast the r esults of studies on efficiency frontier of railways in its most different methods", "and characteristics. It was done a n evaluation of the heterogeneity of the efficiency scores and possible explanations for the variance found. In search of robustness, a per mutation test was used to overcome the requirement of normal distribution of the dependent variable (VIECHTBAUER, 2010) and other potential resources of misleading results in meta -analyses when in the presence of heterogeneity, few number of studies or covariates (HIGGINS; THO MPSON, 2004) . The way the meta -analysis was conducted was then different than solely analysing the resu lts of a meta -regression. The objective of this research is, using a meta - analysis of 50 observations contained in 21 selected studies on efficiency f rontier of railways, carried out between 2000 and 2016, to recognize the key aspects that may influence th e variation in the sample’s mean efficiency that is not identified in each individual research. The main questions that this paper seeks to clarify ar e: “Does the geographic location of the railways influence mean efficiency estimates?”, “Does the type of rail services affect the mean efficiency estimates?”, “Can different methodologies applied influence mean efficiency scores?”, “Can the modelling char acteristics employed in each study, such as the number of variables (NVAR) or the ratio between the number of decision making units (NDMUs) and the NVAR, influence mean efficiency scores?”, and “Can the database structure applied, such as panel data or cro ss- section, influence mean efficiency scores?” The findings contribute to the debate of which conditions ( operational, location, modelling) lead to higher efficiency, which is of interest to railway managers and public agencies that control and regulate railway systems.", "This paper is organized as follows. Section 3.2 contains the literature review and indicate s the gap found. The characteristics and limitations of the methods used in the efficiency frontier studies are summarized. Section 3.3 des cribes the methodology used to analy se the data. Section 3.4 presents the database, the model adjustment , and the emp irical results. Validation methods and p ublic policies based on the findings are commented. Section 3.5 concludes the discussion showing th e study’s limitations and gives suggestions for further projects for advanc ing the knowledge of efficiency frontiers in the railway sector.", "3.2 LITERATURE REVIEW", "There are several studies in the literature that evaluated the efficiency fr ontier of the passenger and cargo rail transport systems, including efficiency rankings. Putting a focus on the methodologies applied, Bil (2013), Hilmola (2007), Bhanot and Singh (2014), and Jitsuzumi and Nakamura (2010) used the classical methodology DEA . Bil (2013) also evaluated the over - estimation of the efficiency scores by comparing the DEA classic model scores with those of the Pareto -Koopmans efficiency frontier using the SBM methodology and the assurance region", "method of 23 European railroads. He concluded tha t the results are sensitive to the models used, but probably do not have a greater impact on the efficiency ranking. Hilmola (2007) evaluated the efficiency of European railways and the adaptation of the firms at the declining of the demand and concluded t hat the railways in the Baltic countries, Estonia and Latvia, are the most efficient in cargo transportation. Bhanot and Sigh (2014) presented the performance indicators of the rail container transport in India after the process of breaking up the monopoly of the state enterprise CONCOR, identifying the lowest efficiency of the state -owned company during the period analysed. Jits uzumi and Nakamura (2010) used DEA and the cost -based efficiency model suggested by Farrell (1957) and Debreu (2012) to analyse th e causes of inefficiency of the Japanese railways and proposed a method of calculating the optimum level of subsidy to compens ate for regional disparities. They concluded that there are railroads that received grants above what was indicated by their model , suggesting that the methodology proposed can bring benefits to public officials. Oum , Pathomsiri and Yoshida (2013) used the nonparametric method Directional Output Distance Function (DO DF), a derivative DEA model with the ability to incorporate undesira ble outputs , with composite indicators of social efficiency to evaluate the efficiency of the DMUs and they concluded that the railways are more socially efficient than airlines. George and Rangaraj (2008) used the DEA and Super Efficiency DEA (SDEA) metho dologies to evaluate the performance of the railway zones of the Indian network and identified what were the zones of better p erformance and their efficiency trends. Yu (2008), Yu and Lin (2008) and Doomernik (2015) used the Network DEA (NDEA) approach. Yu (2008) assessed production efficiency, service effectiveness, and the efficiency of 40 European railway systems. Yu and Lin (2008) evaluated the efficacy of 20 passenger and cargo railroads selected in the world and Doomernik (2015) used NDEA on the high -speed systems to transport passengers in Asian and European countries. Yu (2008) and Yu and Lin (2008) consider that the metho dology allowed greater insights regarding the sources of inefficiency and thus helped improve the performance of the systems. Doom ernik (2015) found the most efficient systems of the sample and the factors that contribute to high performance production. Sh i, Lim and Chi (2011), Guzman and Montoya (2011), Kaba sakal, Kutlar and Sarikaya (2013) and Doomernik (2015) not only analysed eff iciency based on the DEA or NDEA models, but they also evaluated the productivity evolution of the American railways, of the S panish railways, of certain selected railways in the world, and of the HSR systems, respectively, by analysing the evolution of th e Malmquist Index. Shi , Lim and Chi (2011) examined the factors of productivity gains of each American railroad, concluding th e leadership of Burlington Northern Santa Fé (BNSF) followed by Union Pacific (UP). Guzmán and Montoya (2011) analysed the product ivity gains", "in the Spanish railroads that would explain the next corporate movements in the period analysed. Kaba sakal, Kutlar and Sarikaya (2013) analysed the DEA models and the range of productivity of 31 railways in the world and concluded that the small -scale railways set up for non-economic factors (political or ethnic), such as in Spain and Bosnia, are unproductive. Some studies carried out a second stage of the analysis by analysing contextual variables. Hilmola (2011) used a linear regression af ter applying the DEA model and analysed the relationship between the efficiency scores of the public transport systems and the sha re of using the individual transport by car in large cities, concluding that there is a significant relationship between the l ower modal share of transport by car and the higher efficiency levels of those systems. Kutlar , Kabasakal and Sarikaya (2013) used the Tobit Regression to determine which outputs of the DEA model were significant for the DEA efficiency scores, concluding t hat the outputs used were more significant to explain the allocative efficiency. Wanke and Barros (2015) estimated efficiency scor es in the Brazilian railway industry using Distance Friction Minimization (DFM) and by the Tobit Regression investigated the e ffects of the contextual variables, location, and type of cargo in these estimates. They concluded that the regulatory authorities should consider two groups of companies for funding with different interest rates on investments in infrastructure: one focus ed on the transportation of iron ore and the other for the transportation of agricultural commodities and containerized general ca rgo. Kabakasal , Kutlar and Sarikaya (2013) used a panel regression for analysing the influence of the outputs on the efficienc y scores found. They concluded that the CCR model with constant yields of scale offers more significant explanations for the influ ence of the outputs on the efficiency scores than the BCC model with variable yields of scale where the outputs were not signi ficant. Mallikarjun , Lewis and Sexton (2014) applied non -oriented NDEA to evaluate the efficiency of 24 rail systems of public tra nsportation in the United States during 2001 -2010. To evaluate the relationship between inefficiency and subsidies, the Censor ed Tobit Regression and Generalized Least Squares (GLS) Regression with bootstrapping were used to overcome discussions about nonp arametric efficiency measurements. The conclusion was that the highly subsidized systems are, on average, less efficient with respect to operating expenses and tariff revenue compared with those that are less subsidized. Parametric methods were also used f or evaluating the railway’s efficiency. Crafts , Mills and Mulatu (2007) used Total Factor Productivity (TFP), the efficient ch ange, to analyse the British railways’ productivity between 1852 -1912, concluding the existence of management problems related to collusion and barriers to entry. Leunig, Mulatu and Crafts (2008) used TFP to assess whether the British railways were well ma naged in the early 20th century. They concluded that the companies were generally", "not well administered a hundred years ago as the y were affected by inefficiency of costs and low growth in the TFP. Neither competition nor regulation were effective. Couto a nd Graham (2008) used Stochastic Frontier Analysis (SFA) to analyse the efficiency of the European railway transport industry betw een 1972 -1999, concluding the average loss of 15% in efficiency due to higher costs caused by technical (6.5%) and allocative (7%) inefficiency. Kumb hakar et al. (2007) used Latent Class Model (LCM) and panel data from 17 European railroads between 1971 -1974. The conclusion was that the orientation by input is preferred after the European directives of 1984 (management by busines s unit, separating accounts, and each segment costs) to increase the profitability of companies or reduce losses. It was suitable for railways in Spain, Portugal, Greece, and Ireland. The orientation by output was suitable for railways in Switzerland, Luxe mbourg, Norway, Denmark, and Sweden. Graham (2008) compared the results of efficiency measured with DEA and TFP concluding in the similarity of rankings, despite differences in the returns in scale of the commuter rail companies.

The ones in the transportation sector are presented for methodological and findings references. Castillo -Manzano and Castro - Nuño (2012) carried out a meta -analysis of the effects of adopting the system of points on drivers' licenses in road ac cidents and the duration of the effects. The authors concluded that there are strong initial eff ects (15 to 20% reduction of accidents, fatalities, and losses) that seem to disappear after 18 months. Nocera , Tonin and Cavallaro (2015) investigated the econ omic impact of GHG reduction in 60 studies. They evaluated the variation in the emission costs t o statistically reduce the uncertainty of the amounts. Through a meta -regression it was found that the discount rate adopted is statistically significant for th e results. Limiters for the meta -analysis were also reported by Cavill et al . (2008) who have ma de a systematic review of the economic analysis that include health effects related to cycling and walking. Since there was a wide variety in the approaches tak en by the authors, a lack of transparency was found, and the meta - analysis could not be done. Wa rdman , Chintakayala and De Jong (2016 ) conducted an extensive meta -analysis of value of time from 389 European studies and 26 European countries. The meta -model estimated, among other items, mean values of commuting, business, other and all kinds of trips, contrasting to official values. They reached the conclusion that the difference between meta -model estimates and official values is far from statistically sign ificant. Dimitropoulos , Rietveld and Van Ommeren (2013) performed a meta -analysis with 33 studie s that investigated consumer preferences for electric and other alternative fuel vehicles. They reached the conclusion that consumers are willing to pay on aver age between US$ 66 and US$ 75 of capital cost for a one -mile increase in driving range. Mohammad et al. (2013) conducted a meta -analysis on 23 studies that analysed the impact of rail on land/property value changes. They reached the conclusion that commute r rail was found to have higher impacts on land/property value changes in comparison to light ra il and heavy rail dampened the effect on land/property values compared to light rail. They also found that the impact of rail on land/property values was higher in European and East Asian cities compared to cities in North America. Holmgren (2007) applied meta -regression to explain the wide variation in elasticity estimates obtained in previous demand studies. He concluded that demand models should include car ow nership, price of fuel, income, and some measure of service among the explanatory variables. Ode ck and Bråthen (2012) present a meta -analysis of variations in seaport mean technical efficiency scores based on 40 studies published in refereed academic journ als. They encouraged the use of random -effects models. Using a Tobit Regression model, they reac hed the conclusion that studies that used nonparametric DEA models depict higher", "mean technical efficiency ( 𝑇𝐸̅̅̅̅) scores compared with those that used SFA models, panel data studies have lower 𝑇𝐸̅̅̅̅ scores as compared with cross -sectional data, and studies using European seaport data produce lower 𝑇𝐸̅̅̅̅ scores when compared with the rest of the world. Brons e t al. (2005), considered the first meta -analysis in transport (ODECK; BRÅTHEN, 2012) , explained the statistical variation in efficiency findings reported in the literature. They used OLS (Ordinary Least Squares) and WLS (Weighted Least Squares) regression models and reached the conclusion that the type of database, region, and the output measurement method influence technical efficiency. Results showed tha t there is no statistical difference in technical efficiency between parametric and nonparametric studi es and that there is a positive univariate relationship between the number of inputs and the efficiency ratio.", "As to our best knowledge, it is the first time meta -analysis is used to aggregate and contrast the results of studies on efficiency frontier of r ailways in its most different methods and characteristics to identify findings on how the variables used by the researchers affect the results found in t hese studies. Although studies with meta -regression have already evaluated the effect of variables sele cted on the dependent variable (BRONS et al. , 2005; KABASAKAL; KUTLAR; SARIKAYA, 2013; NOCERA; TONIN; CAVALLARO, 2015; ODECK; BRÅTHEN, 2012; THIAM; BRAVO -URETA; RIVAS, 2001) , this paper, following Viechtbauer (2010) , used a permutation test, a process that is random, with repetition, thus overcoming limitations as to the normal distribution of the dependent variabl e and other potential sources of misleading results in meta -analyses (see more in s ubsection 3.4.1).", "3.2.1 Characteristics and Limitations of the Methods", "A brief set of the main technical characteristics that differs efficiency models are summarized in order to prepare the reader to follow the meta -analysis purposes. DEA and SFA methodologies are two of the techniques most used in estimating efficiency frontiers (FIORENTINO; KARMANN; KOETTER, 2006; HJALMARSSON; KUMBHAKA R; HESHMATI, 1996; ODECK; BRÅTHEN, 2012) . DEA is a deterministic and nonparametr ic method introduced by Charnes , Cooper and Rhodes (1978) based on linear programming (BOGETOFT; OTTO, 2011; DERVAUX; KERSTENS; VANDEN EECKAUT, 1998; VITON, 1997) that estimates the best practices of the efficiency frontier, evaluating the relative efficiency of the firms (BOGETOFT; OT TO, 2011) . SFA is a stochastic and parametric method based on the econometric th eory that assumes that deviations from the frontier may reflect not only inefficiencies but also the existence of random error in the data estimate (BOGETOFT;", "OTTO, 2011) , statistical error or other non -systematic influences (AMORNKITVIKAI; HARVIE, 2010) . Efficiency estimates vary considerably between studies (FIORENTINO; KARMANN; KOET TER, 2006) . In some studies, the SFA estimates are substantially higher than with DEA (FIORENTINO; KARMANN; KOETTER, 2006) , sensitive to heterogeneity and errors in the da tabase (KHEZRIMOTLAGH, 2013) because of the presence of heterogeneous observations that affect the average efficie ncy in a more intense way than in the SFA methodology. In some studies, however, the estimates using D EA were higher than estimates with SFA (KUCHLER, 2013) . Ekanayake and Jayasuriya (1985) indicate that the deterministic frontiers tend to overestimate the inefficiency in relation to the stochastic frontiers. This is not surprising since the deterministic estimates attribute all errors to inefficiency (BRONS et al., 2005) . Bogetoft and Otto (2 011) indicate that there is a tendency for efficiency estimates using DEA to be greater than estimates using SFA for higher efficiency levels and the opposite for lower efficiency levels. Overall, the experiences are definitely not conclusive. Some authors , however, argue that there are no significant differences between the methods and that there is not o nly one method to properly evaluate the efficiency frontier. They view these methodologies as complementary rather than competing (KUCHLER, 2013) . NDEA methodology considers the system composed of different processes or stages, each with its own inputs an d outputs and intermediate flows between stages. Lozano , Gutiérez and Luís (2009) consider the NDEA me thodology as having more discriminating power than the conventional DEA methodology because it allows for a more detailed analysis of the entire productio n process. SDEA, developed by Andersen and Petersen (1993), is a method that seeks to differentiate th e DMUs on the efficiency frontier (BOGETO FT; OTTO, 2011) . It is especially interesting when several DMUs are on the efficiency frontier and th eir differentiation is of interest to the researcher. The DF model describes how far or close an element is from the frontier, first introduced by Chamber s, Chung and Färe (1998) and the additive model of Charnes et al. (1985) (ADLER; MARTINI; VOLTA, 2013) . The DFM approach, developed by Suzuki et al. (2010), serves to improve the performance of a DMU by identifying the most appropriate movement towards the efficiency f rontier surface based on a Euclidean distance metric in weighted spaces. SBM is a measure of efficiency considering minimizing the inputs and maximizing t he outputs simultaneously (COOPER; SEIFORD; TONE, 2006) . In the SBM frontier, the DMU is completely effective if, and only if, better inputs or outputs are not possible without worsening another input or output (COOPER; SEIFORD; TONE, 2006) , considering that the Pareto -Koopmans efficiency frontier is not always guarante ed in the classic DEA models. Lastly, the LCM is a stochastic model assuming that heterogeneity exists in the sample", "that suggests different production technologies adopted within the sample. The frontier production set measures the difference between inef ficient units and the frontier through residuals (errors), which have two components: noise and ineffi ciency.", "3.3 METHODOLOGY: A META -ANALYSIS", "3.3.1 Search, Exclusion Criteria, and the Literature Review Results ( Coding Process) Some criteria were used to systematica lly review the literature. We selected recent papers published on efficiency of railways (from 2000 until 2016) pertaining to well -known databases (Proquest, Science Direct, Web of Science) and from Emerald journals, justifying the quality of the papers. T he characteristics from each study selected were registered: title, author(s), year published, author’s country, study location, and study object. We selected a list of common variables applied in each study: rail service offered (infrastructure), number o f railways evaluated (decision making units), efficiency model applied, number and type of inputs and outputs considered, database structure, model orientation, second stage analysis (if any), and second stage model (if any). We calculated the mean efficie ncy found considering the efficiency modelling developed in each study. Table 3.1, in Section 3.2, summarizes the data from the studies selected. The objective pursued is to examine patterns of evidence of the relationship between study features and the me an efficiency found, verifying what is the effect size (the direction, the size, and the statis tical significance) over the mean efficiency. Effect size is used in literature to denote the variable chosen for meta -analysis (VIECHTBAUER, 2010) . A meta -analysis often uses multiple result s drawn from the same study, a technique also used in this study. Subsection 3.4.4 will treat this issue when conducting the validation methods. After a brainsto rm, the initial keywords used to search the relevant literature were: “transport”, “efficiency” , “DEA”, and “SFA”, techniques most used in estimating efficiency frontiers (FIORENTINO; KARMANN; KOETTER, 2006; HJ ALMARSSON; KUMBHAKAR; HESHMATI, 1996; ODECK; BRÅTHEN, 2012) , and “TFP”, a technique also commonly used. Studies collected without an efficiency evaluation model were excluded. Efficiency st udies of a transport mode other than railways were excluded. The k eyword “railways” was, then, included to refine the search. Studies conducted with financial variables, cost-based or without an efficiency scoring available were excluded. There is a public ation bias since only published papers were selected. Figure 3.2 shows the flowchart with the results of the systematic review.", "Figure 3.2: Prisma flow diagram of the 21 studies selected (LIBERATI et al., 2009)", "3.3.2 The Selection Model Decision", "This paper will adopt the random effects model because the studies differ from each other bec ause of different methodologies, constructs , and variables used by the authors. When studies are gathered from published literature, the random effects model is generally a more plausible match (BORENSTEIN et al., 2009) . In this empirical study, the dependent variable is the mean efficiency estimates in each of the studies. This possibility has already been previously used in Thiam , Bravo -Ureta and Rivas (2001), Brons at al. (2005), and Odeck and Bråthen (2012) . The independent variables are as follows : the railway’s geographic location, the type of service offered, the type of model used, the NVAR, the ratio between NDMUs and NVAR, and type of database. Hypothesis tests carried out in S ubsection 4 .2 seek to elucidate an important part of the vari ance (KULIK; KULIK, 1989) found in the mean efficienc y scores between the studies. The intentio n was not to explain the totality of the variance, translate d into tau2 (BORENSTEIN; HEDGES; ROTHSTEIN, 2007) , which would require numerous other possibilities. This research aimed only to find statistical significance of common variables used in previous studies th at contributed to elucidate the research questions.", "3.4 ANALYSIS OF THE DATABASE AND DISCUSSION OF RESULTS", "3.4.1 Database and Model Fitting", "Table 3.1 presents 50 observations from 21 papers on efficiency frontier of railways developed in different regions with 10 di fferent methodologies. The structure of the analysis was in a way similar to inputs, production process, and outputs being considered in t he estimate of relative efficiency of the DMUs (DERVAUX; KERSTENS; VANDEN EECKAUT, 1998; FÄRE ; KNOX LOVELL, 1978; VITON, 1997) . Some studies reported more than one efficiency model.’ The number of observation s taken from the same study was a concern since using many observations from the same study could introduce a bias and invalidate the hypo thesis tests. This issue is treated in subsection 3.4.4.", "The studies were developed on railroads located in Brazil, US , UK, countries of the European Community, China, India, Japan , and Taiwan. Some authors assessed the relative efficiency of railways in d ifferent parts of the world together. In this case we used the world as the location factor. Some articles analy sed on ly European railroads. In this case, EU was used as the location factor. The aim was to test the hypothesis of there being any evidence or characteristic in some region that contributes to explain the mean efficiency. S ubsection 3.2.1 presented the charact eristics and limitations of the various techniques that have been used to evaluate the efficiency frontier of railways. There are studies in literature that compare methodologies (AMORNKITVIKAI; HARVIE, 2010; BOGETOFT; OTTO, 2011; FIORENTINO ; KARMANN; KOETTER, 2006; HJALMARSSON; KUMBHAKAR; HESHMATI, 1996; KUCHLER, 2013) . In this study, the techniques have been g rouped into parametric and nonparametric models to compare the results obtained with what the literature would indicate. Additiona lly, among the nonparametric techniques, it was highlighted the studies that used the NDEA methodology that better detail the production process flow. The objective was to test the hypothesis of a statistical difference between the results with nonparametr ic models including DEA and with NDEA methodology. Another highlight was the variable type of service offered, which included the factors conventional cargo, conventional cargo and passengers, conventional passengers , and HSR. The aim was to test whether t he type of service significantly influences the mean efficiency found. It was a concern of this study if there is a high corre lation between the factors location and type of service. Railways in Japan are predominantly passenger services railways while in the US and Brazil they are predominantly freight railways. In the EU and India and in different parts of the world, however, o ne has to identify the type of service of each railway, as there are different kind s of", "services offered in the region. Thus, it w as assumed that there is not a high correlation between the location and the type of service of the railway. The NVAR used by each author and the relationship between NDMUs and NVAR in each of the researches were also selected. The aim was to test and anal yse the significance of these quantitative variables in the mean efficiency scores obtained. Finally, the structure of the dat abase used was highlighted in the factors panel data or cross -section (BRONS et al., 2005; ODECK; BRÅTHEN, 2012; THIAM; BRAVO - URETA; RIVAS, 2001) to test the sig nificance of the data structure in the values of mean efficiency.

The results indicate that the railways in Japan and the United States have a mean efficiency statistically higher than i n the studies that assessed railways in different parts of the world ( world factor), considering a confidence interval of 5%", "(Japan) and 1% (US). These findings indicate that there are operational or locational charac teristics that lead to improved perform ance of the railway passenger transportation companies in Japan and freight transportation in the US. The results suggest that, as highlighted in Section 1, the higher indicators of productivity found in the passenger railways in Japan and the higher ATDF found in the American railways may be factors that could leverage the mean efficiency (CARBAJO; DE R US, 1991) . This can lead to further investigations to confirm the suggested insights. Additionally, the results of the studies on EU railways, which were not statistically different from those found in studies assess ing railways from different parts of th e world, suggest what is stated by Wheat and Nash (2006) where the railways in Europe still had difficulty in providing a competitive combination of cost and quality and to adapt to the European regulatory guidelines. Such guidelines are aimed at opening t he market and putting a greater competitive pressure on the network (KUMBHAKAR et al., 2007; WHEAT; NASH, 2006) , especially in countries that have had little p rogress in advancing reforms (Greece an d Ireland) or that have implemented them partially (Finland, France , and Spain) with separation of the operating infrastructure while the management and operation is maintained in the public sector without a competiti ve selection process (WHEAT; NASH, 2006) . The results found in studies done in India and Brazil are not statistically different from the results of the studies assessing r ailways in different parts of the world . This suggests that both the Indian and the Brazilian systems are still looking for performance improvements and still do not differ statistically, although the coefficients give a positive direction and a certain ma gnitude (intensity). In the case of Bra zil, the transportation of iron ore and agricultural commodities on broad gauge (1 .60 m) are elements that leverage the increased efficiency (MARCHETTI; WANKE, 2017) . However, no statistical difference was found considering the other types of cargo and track gauges (1.00 m and mixed). In the case of India, notwithstanding the hi gh productivity in passenger transport (Section 1), the results indicate that there was no statistical difference.", "The variable TYPE OF SERVICE was statistically significant to explain part of the variation found in mean efficiency. The results indicate that the mean efficiency in the mixed conventional , and mainly of passenger only systems , was statistically superior to the cargo only conventional systems when considering a 5% confidence interval. The HSR systems differ statistically in both direction and magnitude considering a 1% confidence i nterval. These results were expected in that the rail passenger systems are equipped with operational systems and procedures of signa lling, control , and safety that are more sophist icated than the cargo only systems, especially the HSR systems, giving them different conditions for increased efficiency.", "It also suggests the ability to operate passenger transport together with freight transport with high productivity, as in Asia (e.g. China) and European systems (e.g. France and Germany). The variable MODEL T YPE was statistically significant. The results indicate that the parametric model ling was statistically different from the nonparametric models, considering a 10% confidence interval. The positive coefficient indicates higher values of mean efficiency on the parametric models than on the nonparametric models. This suggests that the sens itivity of the DEA nonparametric models in the presence of heterogeneity in the database, of outliers , and the existence of error in the parametric model estimates (KHEZRIMOTLAGH, 2013) may explain this condition ( subsection 2.1). Furthermore, the deterministic approach tends to overest imate the inefficiency, affecting the average efficiency scores (BRONS et al., 2005; ODECK; BRÅTHEN, 2012) . However, unexpectedly, the mean efficiency found among studies with the NDEA methodology and studies with ot her nonparametric models , including DEA , were not statistically different. The NDE A mode lling allows to systematically and sequentially detail the production process under analysis, thus expecting significantly different results from those found in other n onparametric models , including the DEA. The empirical results did not confirm this difference.", "The variable NVAR was statistically significant. The results indicate that there is a positive contribution in the mean efficiency the greater the NVAR. Models with many variables can be more complex and rigid due to lower number of degrees o f freedom ( NDF ) and less reproducible to explain different samples. It suggests the hypothesis of losing its discriminatory power and less rigorous values of mean efficiency (COOPER; SEIFORD; TONE, 2006) . Odeck and Bråthen (2012) and Brons et al. (2005) reached this conclusion in a meta -analysis developed with ports and urban public transport, respectively.", "The variable NDMUs/NVAR was statistically significant to explain part of the variation found in the mean efficiency, but in an inversely proportional way (negative coefficient). This result was expected. The NDF increases with the NDMUs, but decreases with the NVAR (COOPER; SEIFORD; TONE, 2006) . This suggests that when there is growth of the NDMUs or a reduction of the NVAR, the NDF and the discriminatory power o f the model increase, thus reducing the scores. The ratio between those variables increases and suggests a negative impact on the mean efficiency scores. The empirical result confirmed the effect. The variable DB was not statistic ally significant. The resu lts indicate that the mean efficiency in studies using panel data was not statistically different from those in cross -section studies. The result was not expected since the panel data models assess the efficiency of a system over several years and could be more rigorous in evaluating the mean efficiency, leading", "to statistical differences not confirmed in this study. The negative sign of the coefficient, however, indicates lower values of mean efficiency, which is in line with Odec k and Bråthen 3.4.4 Validation: Leave -One-Out Cross -Validation (LOOCV) and Independence of Observations ( Weighted Regression) A cross validation of the results was made. The Leave -One-Out Cross -Validation (LOOCV) was considered adequate because of the si ze (50 observations) and t he singularity of the sample.

Railways, although naturally having economic and environmental competitive advantage s over road transport, have struggled to provide a competitive combination of costs and quality (WHEAT; NASH, 2006) . In the European community and the US, regulatory mecha nisms came into place to ensure the best allocation of resources, improv ing the efficiency of systems and regain ing of market share (CARBAJO; DE RUS, 1991; EUROPEAN POLICY CENTRE, [s.d.]; LEGAL INFORMATION INSTITUTE, [s.d.]; W HEAT; NASH, 2006) . They include encouraging competition or competitive pressure in the services (WHEAT; NASH, 2006) , removing barriers to enter and exit the passenger and cargo markets (LEGAL INFORMATION INSTITUTE, [s.d.]; WHEAT; NASH, 2006) , setting up competitive processes in approving operators (WHEAT; NASH, 2006) , ensuring non -", "discriminatory access, tariffs , and allocation of slots (LEGAL INFORMATION INSTITUTE, [s.d.]) , integra ting with different means of transport and reducing GHG emissions (EUROPEAN POLICY CENTRE, [s.d.]) , introducing new technologies to improve quality (CARBAJO; DE RUS, 1991) , giving priority to economic factors and to the financial obstacles in the allocation of resources (CARBAJO; DE RUS, 1991) , clarifying the relationship between the State (subsidies) and operators (r evenue) (WHEAT; NASH, 2006) , and promoting th e full exploitation of the technical advantages over road and air transport (CARBAJO; DE RUS, The implication of the work could be valuable for railway managers and public agencies that control and regulate rail system s. The empirical results also found suggest reflections of public policy makers as to the regulatory aspects that drive rail trans port. The significance of the location factors found suggests that variables such as productivity, traffic intensity, and ATDF are factors likely to increase efficiency. This reiterates the guidelines set out in Carbajo and De Rus (1991) where services mus t respond to demand and seek to introduce new technologies to improve the quality with a priority to economic factors. These g uidelines are characteristics more strongly observed in the Asian systems such as China and Japan, but also Korea and Taiwan and i n the European systems, but differently (e.g. the systems in France and Germany have a higher productivity than in Spain), and less observed in the Americas, except in the United States, whose railways have a high ATDF. The existence of subsidized unprofit able lines, not necessarily done in a transparent way, also sets a concern about the efficiency of the operation. Furthermore, the significance regarding the type of service found suggests the importance of the ability of the railway systems to combine pas senger transportation with their more complex systems of signalling, control & safety, and cargo transport, as one can observe in higher productive European systems and Asian systems. It can mean improvement in allocating resources and increased efficiency . The result also means an important warning to the American systems, especially in Brazil and US, where there is a predominan ce or almost exclusive cargo transportation. Efficiency frontier studies showed, in turn, a positive significant influence of mixe d transportation service over the mean efficiency. There was no information in the studies selected of the existence of regula tory mechanisms that hinder competition in the various systems analysed such as price discrimination for access to infrastructure or difficulty of allocating slots to third parties, as well as the ownership of each railways, whether private or public or bo th. It would be interesting for new studies to evaluate the effect of these regulatory variables, which represent barriers to entr y, and the effect of the", "ownership on the mean efficiency of the systems and whether they could explain part of the variance f ound.", "The analyses of efficiency frontiers and the consequent development of company rankings are often used for performance evalu ation purposes of many public services carried out by regulatory agencies responsible for monitoring and inspecting operations . The significance of the type of methodology found suggests some aspects that may be of interest to these agencies. Although the NDEA and other nonparametric methodologies including DEA were not significantly different to the average scores of efficiencie s, this result should be viewed with parsimony. It is not just about the statistical difference between the mean scores. Knowledge of the effectiveness of each part of the flow of the production process by applying the NDEA methodology can better direct sp ecific actions in pursuit of efficiency. Moreover, when the nonparametric widely used DEA methodology loses discrimination power b y increasing the NVAR (COOPER; SE IFORD; TONE, 2006) , by the heterogeneity of data , and/or the presence of outliers (KHEZRIMOTLAGH, 2013) , then a complementary e valuation method can be used. This corroborates the above in Kuchler (2013) that evaluates the DEA (nonparametric) and SFA (pa rametric) methods more as complementary than as competitive models and as being able to understand better the efficiency results f ound. Finally, the model ling used by these agencies should be consciou s about the increase in NVAR. The growth of this variable is significant in the results of efficiency and can impose greater rigidity and complexity to the methodology, which may become undesirable for assessing the efficiency of public services.", "3.5 CONCLUSIONS", "The research sought to address, through meta -analysis followed by a permutation test, a production process that to the best of our knowledge had never been investigated in the literat ure. From a systematic review of articles assessing the efficiency frontier of the railway systems, this paper aimed at obtaining results not identified in each study individually that may explain part of the variance found in the mean efficiency estimates between surveys. Twenty - one papers were selected from the literature during the period 2000 -2016, which were done in different regions with 10 different methodologies. The studies were systematically reviewed and allowed 50 observations. Validation method s were conducted to surpass bias. The findings obtained may be of interest to railway managers and public agencies that control and regulate railway systems.", "The results suggest that railways located in Japan and in the US have characteristics that push th em toward increasing efficiency. Factors such as productivity in the Japanese case and ATDF in the American case may ex plain the outcome and can lead to further investigations. Railway systems that transport passengers reached a significantly higher effici ency than that of conventional cargo systems. Furthermore, findings suggest that the ability of the railway systems to combine passenger transportation with their more complex systems and procedures of signalling, control & safety, and cargo transport, as in the high productivity Asian (e.g. China) and European (e.g. France and Germany) systems, may mean conditions of impr ovement in the allocation of resources and greater efficiency. This would imply in an important warning mainly for the American systems, especially those in Brazil and US, where there is a predominance or almost exclusive cargo transportation. The way the efficiency frontier study is conducted including methodology, NVAR, and the ratio between NDMUs and NVAR may influence the scores. Unexpe ctedly, database structure did not significantly influence the estimates. Additional studies may confirm these effects.", "The use of meta -analysis in an economic production sector involves a considerable planning and can face limitations. First, the selectio n of papers and common variables. The preliminary stages of meta -analyses such as the review of the literature and the selection of the studies and variables are much more complicated than in quantitative reviews that have been completed so far (MAKSIMOVIĆ, 2011) . Besides, papers do not always express variables, estimates, standard errors, etc. the same way. Sometimes part of the information is omitted, leading the meta analyst to face difficulties or even a limitation. This is the case of thi s research. Second is that, although meta -analysis has led to a great progress in quantitative researches (MAKSIMOVIĆ, 2011) , findings can be limited by the selection criteria of papers in the literature. Because of this, complementary studie s should be conducted including the enlargement of the literature review. Third, a valid meta -analysis depends on acces sory robustness analysis such as independence of terms, independence of observations, the requirement of normal distribution of the depen dent variable, and other potential resources of misleading results when in the presence of heterogeneity, few number of studies or covariates (HIGGINS; THOMPSON, 2004) . This research, besides the findin gs reached, tried to conduct a robust meta -analysis in an economic sector in a way that it can be replicated. That could be a proper find ing of the research.", "The study has as a limiting factor the lack of the value of the standard error and yearly estimate s, as this information is not always available. Further studies can be conducted such as the statistical significance of the effect of re gulatory variables (existence of barriers to entry", "such as discriminatory access tariffs or difficulty in allocating sl ots to third parties) and of the ownership of the railways.

The Brazil ian rail cargo system (BRCS), however, presents a heterogeneous performance and i s focused on the transportation of mineral and agricultural bulk for export with a low average efficiency, reducing its economic impact. The paper investigates the extreme per formances of BRCS through a new hybrid model that combines the methodology Techni que for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) with a genetic algorithm of differential evolution for estimating the weights of the criteria in optimized sc enarios, which is a gap in the literature. In a second stage, the significance of the selected variables was evaluated. The transport of any type of cargo, the centralized control of the operation, and the sharing of the railway track are significant for t he scores. The findings suggest that competition and diversification of services are key elements for high performance. Public and management strategies are discussed.", "Keywords : TOPSIS; genetic algorithm; efficiency; railway sections; railroads; Brazil", "4.1 INTRODUCTION", "The Brazilian rail cargo system (BRCS) has an extension of about 29,000 km deployed since the second half of the 19th century in a dispersed and isolated way (MUNHOZ, [s.d.]) where modern and obsolete infrastructure of the railway track and rolling stock can be found side by side. It is operated by private capital railway concessionaires broken down into subsystems, granted by the federal government between 1 996-1999. The concession model included, cumulatively, the granting of the right to use the railway along with the lease of the operational assets and the support facilities required for the operation.", "The concession term in most cases was for 30 years. Th e BRCS subsystems is translated into a regional sector and verticalized monopoly (MARCHETTI; FERREIRA, 2012) with low inter-modal competition, even though there are regulations that seek to promote the increase of supply and competition on the network by means of the trackage right regime, where the access to the infrastructure of another concessionaire with its own trains is done in exchange for a fee, or the haulage right regime, where the owner of the railroad operates trains for another concessionaire in exchan ge for a fee (ANTT, 2011; LAURINO et al., 2015) . The BRCS is heterogeneous, presenting different standards of efficiency among the operators, and distinct physical and operational characteristics (MARCHETTI; WANKE, 2017) . The main cargo on the tracks are mineral and agricultural commodities for export with a low diversification of scope, reaching up to 95% of its off er (EPL, 2016) . It includes different track gauges: metric (1.0 m), broad (1.6 m), and mixed. The sub systems are installed in all regions of the country, but with low connectivity and integration among them. There are railway sections with high daily circulation of trains and low idleness , but many stretches are little used or no used at all, due to the s inuous and e xtended geometry of the track or even shortage of supply or demand. The technology of the operation comprises elements cuch as computers embedded in the locomotives, centralized control of the operation, auxiliary power along critical stretches , and the ab ility to transport hazardous materials. Its average speed is slow (ANTT, 2013; MARCHETTI; FERREIRA, 2012) , which inhibit s access to cargo of higher added value.", "Brazil has a cargo transportation modal network that is unbalanced when compared with countries of large territorial dimensions (EPL, 2016) . The insertion of rail transport is low (15%) while road transport is the highest with a 65% market share, including long distances trips. This is where the greatest economic, transportati on, and environmental costs are concentrated. Public policies should attempt to change this reality in the long term in order to rebalance the Brazilian transportation network, reducing the transportation and logistics costs, and the emission o f pollutants produced from burning fuels in the transport sector in Brazil, which is twice of the transport average emission registered in the world (FERREIRA et al., 2016) .", "As the BRCS has a heterogeneous performance focused on bulk for export presenting low average efficiency and an economic impact lower than expected, the questio ns of this", "research are as follows: How can a high performance scenario be achieved in the BRCS? What are the significant characteristics of the high performance scenario in the BRCS? The performance of the railway sections, which are the stretches between rail yards, was analysed to answer the research questions . The availability of a database with information of the physical and operational characteristics, transportation capacity, idleness, and the type of the regulation of the railway sections of each c oncessionair e network enabled innovative conclusions about the entire BRCS’s performance , which would not have been found with the traditional analysis of aggregate data. There were 7,351 railway sections selected from 2013 to 2016. The database comes from the Network Statement drawn up every year by the concessionaires and disclosed by the National Land Transportation Agency The paper evaluates the efficiency of rail sections by using the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) that combined with a Differential Evolution Optimization genetic algorithm, simulates the optimized behaviour of the scores in BRCS’ low and high performance scenarios .", "The methodology proposed differs from studies already done in the literature. Several articles have already used a hybrid methodology for analysis of alternatives by using some genetic algorithm for a multi -objective optimization followed by TOPSIS for ranking solutions, in different areas of application, as indicate d in Section 4.2. However, using a genetic algorithm of differential evolution for identifying the weights to be assigned to the variables (criteria) selected in the TOPSIS model for building optimized scenarios was an innovation . As to the best of our kno wledge , a simulati on of the extreme scenarios in a (railway) system based on the characteristics of its network subparts (the rail sections) using a genetic algorithm to optimize the performance of the entire system according to the TOPSIS scores of the su bparts is an innov ative contribution of this research .", "The determinants of BRCS’s performance are revealed in the second stage and are additional contributions from the research . By using a Tobit model, the significance of the contextual variables selecte d in each scenario was analysed such as the technologies employed in the railroad operation, the type of cargo transported, and the type of regulations regarding the use of the railway track (restrictive or open), among others. The significant attributes o f scenarios of low and high performance were highlighted. By analysing the score", "percentiles, the profile of the railway of each concessionaire was identified in the extreme deciles. The less efficient and most efficient railway sections of each scenario can be identified, offering an important contribution of an administrative and managerial nature. The methodology proposed can be applied to different economic sectors treated as a network such as passenger and cargo railway systems and energy or telecommunication transmiss ion lines.", "The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 4.2 presents the literature review and indicates the gap found. Section 4.3 describes the methodology used to analyse the data. The data are presented , and the results are discussed i n Section 4.4. Public policies to achieve a high performance scenario are discussed, as well as management possible insights due to the availability of the ranking of the concessionaires ’ railway sections per scenario. Section 4. 5 concludes the discussion and shows the limitations of the research while giving suggestions for new studies for going deeper into BRCS’s efficiency frontier.", "4.2 LITERATURE REVIEW", "The objectives of the literature review were twofold . The first objective was to list the applications wh ere there was a selection of multi -criteria alternatives with the use of TOPSIS in infrastructure, transport, and more specifically in the railway sector. The second more comprehensive objective was to i dentify the articles that used some genetic algorithm to solve multi -optimization problems together with the TOPSIS methodology, including different areas of interest. The strategy was to investigate how these methods, widely employed in studies that trans cend the infrastructure, transport, and the railway s ectors, were combined in the literature, concluding whether there is an innovative application in the present study A comprehensive survey of the literature involved articles in English reviewed by peers on the basis of widely recognized data.", "4.2.1 TOPSIS in Infrastructure, Transport, and the Railway Sector", "Several authors have used the TOPSIS methodology as a multi -criteria method for making decisions on the ranking of infrastructure alternatives in their stu dies, whether alone or in combination with other meth ods. The uncertainty as to the weights of the criteria was treated in different ways. The main methods to determine the weights of the selection criteria", "include Shannon Entropy, Analytic Hierarchy Proce ss (AHP), Fuzzy AHP, and Delphi Survey . Other authors have used the Fuzzy -TOPSIS method for judging the relevance of the criteria, treat the uncertainty, and rank ing the alternatives.", "Askarifar, Motaffef and Aazaami (2018) ranked the necessary public infra structure requirements along the Mokran coast in Iran with Best Worst Method and TOPSIS to determine the priorities . The results show that ports and private terminals are the best choices for investment while security infrastructure, transport, and energy should be the public administration priorities. Kesha varz-Ghorabaee et al. (2018) proposed a conceptual bridge design process under uncertainty by applying a modified Fuzzy TOPSIS method and compared the results with other multiple criteria decision making (MCDM) methods, concluding that the results were val id. Kannan, Pokharel and Kumar (2009) interpret the 15 alternatives for choosing a third -party reverse logistics provider (3PRLP) in India using Interpretive Structural Modelling (ISM) and Fuzzy -TOPSIS, arriving at a decision -making tool for choosing an 3P RLP. Afful -Dadzie et al. (2015) applied Fuzzy TOPSIS to create a framework for selecting states for aid facilities. Farajpour and Yousefli (2018) identified the parameters that influence the flow of info rmation in supply chain prioritized towards three criteria (measurability, being illustrative, and parameters relevancy) and applied a Fuzzy TOPSIS method to rank the parameters. They concluded that supply chain hardware, and infrastructure; information so ftware, sharing timeliness, and recency, and organiza tional rewards are the highest priorities, while internal and inter -personal communications, and users’ trust, and tendency stand at the bottom of the ranking. Liu and Wei (2018) explored risk factors th rough a survey and calculated the overall risk levels of public -private partnership (PPP) projects for electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure with an integrated Fuzzy TOPSIS, ranking the alternative projects. Rahdar and Khalily -Dermany (2017) propos ed an optimization model for time -resource allocation in wireless ad -hoc networks applying Fuzzy TOPSIS to assign more appropriate time -slot to nodes, reaching the conclusion that the algorithm proposed is more efficient than the available ones. Onat et al . (2016) used a Fuzzy MCDM and TOPSIS method to rank the life cycle sustainability performance of alternative passenger vehicles. The results indicate that hybrid and plug -in hybrid EVs are the best alternatives for both Scenario 1 (existing electric power infrastructure", "in the US) and Scenario 2 (the electr icity to power EVs is generated exclusively via solar stations).", "Applying a hybrid of the Fuzzy Delphi and TOPSIS methods, Pham, Ma and Yeo (2017) developed a methodology to choose the locations of logis tics centres. According the authors, the most importa nt factors are demand, closeness to market, production area, customers, and transportation costs and the provinces of Ho Chi Minh City were the best location for logistics centres in Vietnam. Jayasooriay a et al. (2018) applied a Delphi survey and TOPSIS to optimize green infrastructure treatment train configuration and the sizing combinations for stormwater management in industrial areas. The authors used a Delphi survey to identify the environmental, eco nomic, and social performance measurements and to obt ain the weights. The TOPSIS method was used to identify the optimum from 10 alternatives.", "Huang et al. (2018), with a focus on identifying the level of third -party logistics service sites based on the Ch inese railway stations, applied a two -stage model com bining EWM based on Shannon entropy and TOPSIS and concluded that the eight first -class railway logistic bases are Beijing, Harbin, Xi’an, Wuhan, Nanjing, Guangzhou, Chongqing, and Taiyuan. Other 28 citi es were selected as the second -class railway logistic centres. Zhang et al. (2018) applied the structural Entropy -TOPSIS model to evaluate the performance of a public transport priority implementation in the city of Wuhan from 2006 to 2015, reaching the co nclusion that the performance improved from poor to e xcellent. The weights were determined according to the EWM. Baghery, Shojaei and Khorami (2018) investigated the conditions of the tourism infrastructure from different provinces of Iran and used the Vik or and TOPSIS methods to rank the cities according to the indicators selected. They used the Shannon Entropy method to determine the weights of the indicators. The authors reached the conclusion that the Province of Tehran is under the best conditions and that the province of Ilam is under the worst conditio ns.", "Some authors used AHP to determine the weights of the selection criteria and combined with TOPSIS to rank the alternatives. Moosivand and Farahani (2013) combined AHP and TOPSIS models to determine t he factors attracting tourist in the Isfahan province (Iran) and rank the cities, reaching the conclusion that Isfahan and Kashan are the top two tourist destinations in the province. Singh, Gunasekaran and Kumar (2018) used a Fuzzy", "AHP to determine the re lative weights of the different criteria shortlisted and a Fuzzy TOPSIS to rank the third -party logistics (3PL) for a cold chain and to select the best 3PL based on performance. The major reasons behind the top ranking are an emphasis on automation, innova tion, tracking and tracing, and flexibility. Fabianow sky and Jakiel (2018) used an innovative integrated calculation algorithm that uses the modified extent analysis method on the Fuzzy AHP (EA FAHP) method to obtain the weight vector of the criteria and the Fuzzy TOPSIS to reflect the actual assessment proc esses of the technical condition of railway culverts. Zhang and Xu (2009) used AHP to evaluate weight criteria and an extension TOPSIS with triangle fuzzy numbers to determine the optimal choice in build ing or rebuilding projects of urban railway passenger stations. Yurdakul and Iç (2005) developed a performance measurement model (PMM) to obtain an overall performance score of a manufacturing company in its operational activities. The AHP approach was use d to weigh the dimensions and their sub -components co mbined with TOPSIS. PPM can be used to detect a company’s weak areas in which rating scores are lower than the industry average. Amiri et al. (2009) presented a hybrid MCDM model to assess the competence of the firms using fuzzy sets to measure the perform ance, AHP to evaluate the weights, and TOPSIS to rank the firms, considering different values of α -cut, and a linear assignment method to obtain final rank for alternatives. They concluded that the model is practical for analysing MCDM alternatives.", "Alemi -Ardakani et al. (2016) investigated the effect of weighting methods in TOPSIS and developed a framework to optimize weave pattern selection in fibre reinforced polymer composites. Different types of weighting methods were compared: entropy, the modified digital lo gic (MDL), the criteria importa nce through inter -criteria correlation (CRITIC), the Numeric Logic (NL), and the Adjustable Mean Bars (AMB) methods. The authors concluded that, the NL method, compared to the MDL, increased the accuracy of weights for an exp ert decision maker (DM), and th e AMB method is more interactive, and visual for a less experienced DM. A combinative weighting method was presented. Behzadian et al. (2012) identified that TOPSIS works satisfactorily across different application areas, and then conducted a literature su rvey on TOPSIS applications and methodologies, containing 266 papers from 103 journals since 2000, separated into diverse areas including Supply Chain Management and Logistics. Finally, applying a different", "approach, Liu, Wan g and Wang (2017) used an Impro ved Analytic Hierarchy Process (IAHP) and Entropy Weight Method (EWM) to calculate the weights and a cloud model to overcom e the problem of fuzziness and randomness in emergency railway decision -making.", "4.2.2 The Applications of a Genetic Algorithm together with TOPSIS", "Other studies used genetic algorithms for solving multi -objective optimization problems especially together with TOPSIS for ranking the alternatives. The interest of the research was to recognize the way that these methods were combined in the lite rature in different areas of interest, concluding for an innovative application in the present study. Cheng, Ye and Yang (2009) applied the non -dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA -II) to solve optimiza tion functions and the TOPSIS approach to identi fy the best solution from a Pareto optimal solution set. They reached the conclusions that the NSGA -II outperforms the other genetic algorithms to help manufacturers to find an appropriate collaborative manuf acturing chain for the manufacturing of complex products. Azadeh, Kor and Hatefi (2011) created a hybrid genetic algorithm and TOPSIS simulation (HGTS) for determining the most efficient number of operators and labour assignment in cellular manufacturing s ystems. The entropy method was used to estimate the weight of the attributes. The authors concluded for the superiority and advantages of the proposed HGTS over TOPSIS, Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA), and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Azzam and Mous a (2007) applied a combination of a genetic algo rithm and the ∊-dominance concept to solve the multi -objective reactive power compensation problem and used TOPSIS to assess the best solution from a set of alternatives. The results demonstrate the capabilit ies of the technique proposed in a single run. C heng et al. (2006) presented a general framework to the multiple criteria parameter calibration problem, combining a genetic algorithm with TOPSIS for a rainfall -runoff model for flood forecasting in China. T OPSIS gave the ranking order of alternatives (ch romosomes) and the attributes of multiple criteria are the flood characteristics. They concluded that the hybrid method is and easier when compared with previous studies and feasible and robust to be applied in practice. Huang and Tang (2005) adopted the T aguchi method, neural networks, TOPSIS, and the genetic algorithm to develop an optimization system that evaluates, simultaneously, four qualities of as -spun polypropylene yarn, rather than using engineering experience.

CONCLUSION", "The joint analysis of the findings of the papers that are part of this thesis makes it possible to draw a serie of conclusions that are of the interest to the federal government, which is responsible for planning the SFBC, the agency that monitors, regulat es, and inspects the system, and also the admini strators of the railways. The conclusions and insights that answer the research questions presented in the introduction are subdivided into three approaches: efficiency of the current model; recommendations f or high -performance; and recommendations regardi ng the efficiency evaluation methodology. At the end, the limitations faced and suggestions for further research are discussed.", "5.1 EFFICIENCY OF THE CURRENT MODEL", "In the first paper, considering the sample data for the period 2010 -2014, it can be concluded ba sed on findings that the average efficiency of the SFBC is low, and the performance of concessionaires is heterogeneous, presenting a high dispersion. The concessionaire at the efficiency frontier (EFC) is an outlier. There are companies with growing yield s and decreasing in scale that suggest different strategies for increasing efficiency, including : expanding the activities for those concessionaires with efficiency above the average efficiency and increasing returns to scale ; or reducing the use of inputs (resources), such as rolling stock, or best inputs combinations, for those concessionaires with decreasing returns to scale. Concessionaires whose efficiency are under the average efficiency may ad opt better operational practices, improve railway infrastr ucture, and expand or reduce inputs depending whether with growing yields or decreasing returns to scale. The type of gauge (wide) and the type of cargo transported (mineral and agricultural bulk) a re significant for the efficiency scores . The shared use o f the railway track, however, was not significant for the performance of the operators. Even though some railways have shared use, allowing the passage of trains from more than one concessionaire ac cording to existing regulations, the volume of transport p roduced in the competitive structure does not differ from the structure under a monopoly.", "The findings suggest that the Brazilian cargo railway system is designed for transporting a restricted profi le of goods, and as a result a restricted number of client s, in", "isolated subsystems, intended for export, presenting low integration between rail operations and a low diversity of scope. This performance suggests to explain the low participation of rail mode in the freight transport matrix in Brazil (15%). The tr ansportation of general cargo, the main demand of transport in Brazil (54%) (EPL, 2016) , is marginall y done by rail (1%) due to the existing difficulties in the network, such as winding and excessive length pathways, and/or shortage of supply or demand, and/or a lower managerial interest. This transportation is under the responsibility of the highway tran sport (87%), complemented by the waterway transportation (12%). The concessionaires of the SFBC pursue a more concentrated operation in solid bulk (95%) where the rail transport has a natural compet itive advantage in costs, fuel consumption, and emission o f GHG compared to highway transportation.", "In the second paper, based on the sample object of meta -analysis of 21 studies selected in the literature, compiled in the period 2000 -2016, some findings were decisive to explain the behavior of the average effic iency in various systems in different regions of the globe. The research suggests that the railway productivity and the average transport distance of freight (ATDF) are significant variables for inc reasing efficiency. They significantly determine condition s that push the rail systems in Japan and the US to increasing efficiency. The railways with passenger transportation services or mixed transportation services (passengers and freight ) are significa ntly more efficient than systems for cargo only. This can be explained because the rail systems that transport passengers incorporate systems and operational procedures of signaling, control, and security that are more sophisticated than the railway system s exclusively for cargo, offering better conditions for in creasing efficiency. These are the cases of more productive railway systems in China and in some countries of Europe, especially in France and Germany. The ability of the railway to combine transpor ting passengers and cargo simultaneously means better allo cation of available resources and a potential gain in efficiency. This suggests an important warning mainly for the American and Brazilian rail systems where there is a predominance or almost exclus ive cargo transport. In addition, the concessionaires EFC (benchmarking) and EFVM, among the most efficient in Brazil, operate with mixing the transportation of passengers and freight on the network granted. In other subsystems, the current concessionaires do not share the rail assets granted with other services, such as intercity or regional passenger services, even though there is a", "high average idleness in the great majority of railway sections. This issue is not on the agenda of the railway sector in Br azil, whether by the private operators side or in the plan ning of the federal government, demonstrating certain economic irrelevance that contradicts the findings. It would be necessary to deepen the knowledge about which passenger railway links may signif icantly influence the efficiency of the railway system in Brazil, reducing its idleness, which is not the object of this research. The variables of railway productivity and ATDF may help to clarify the issue.", "In the third paper, analyzing the sample of rai lway sections of the SFBC in the period 2013 -2016, the sim ulation of optimized scenarios brought additional findings to the previous researches. In a high performance scenario, the performance of the concessionaires is homogeneous, different from the low p erformance scenario where there is wide dispersion in the operating performance. The system carries all types of cargo because they are significant for high performance. The transportation of general cargo is significant for the efficiency of the sections, unlike scenarios of low and medium performance whose transportation of solid bulk cargo for export influences the scores. The structure in a monopoly for using the railway tracks is inefficient. The shared use of the railway is significant for high perfor mance, avoiding the situations of a restriction of railway supply that can inhibit the emergence of new services that contribute to reducing the idleness of the assets. In this context, the CCO technology is significant for high performance since it allows controlling a railway's operation that is more dense, wit h trains coming from different regions, operated by several operators, offering differentiated services to customers in an environment of greater integration and complementarity. Sharing the railway tracks avoids typical situations of monopoly structures t hat may cause either a railway sub-offer or setting the transport prices above the operating costs by the current concessionaires. The high performance scenario suggests a market structure where the re is neither restriction of access to the railway track, nor barriers to ent er and exit of new operators and services. The findings of the significance tests performed in the first paper and the characteristics of the optimized scenarios in the third pape r suggest that the current SFBC fits in the medium perform ance scenario where concessionaires still have a heterogeneous performance, the transport is concentrated on a restricted profile of cargo and it is significant for the results, and the shared use o f the track does not differ from the situation in a monopo ly.", "In order to increase the average efficiency of the system, new guidelines should orient the long -term strategic planning of the Brazilian railway sector so as to move the least efficient operato rs toward high performance, approaching them to the effici ency frontier. The regulatory reforms and the contractual structure should be a result from this strategic planning that defines the long -term targets for the entire system.", "5.2 RECOMMENDATIONS FOR HIGH PERFORMANCE", "The planning of the Brazilian rail cargo sys tem should push it to the scenario of high performance through regulations, a competitive environment, and contracts. Based on findings, four strategic guidelines can be formulated. The first strategic guideline for high performance is that the system shou ld be planned as an integrated network, correcting its initial distortion where railroads were installed in a scattered and isolated way, with winding and excessive length pathway (MUNHOZ, [s.d.]) , to meet the export market almost exclusively. Even after the privatization process taking place in the 90s, when the SFBC was subdivided into subsystems inspired in the organization by RFFSA superintendences, the public role of th e Brazilian railway netw ork in the logistics of the country was not made explicit. Only production and safety targets were stablished as targets to each concessionaire. The business planning of the concessionaires is confined to the network granted . Beside s, the governmental syst emic planning is still highly linked to the construction of new isolated railways (BRAZIL, [s.d.]) .", "SFBC lacks an incentive for physical and economic integration of the rail lines that turns feasible the rail transport as part of a n integrated logistic system for the internal distributio n of goods in Brazil. The railway system should provide an economic response to the difficulties and obstacles of Brazilian logistics. The performance of the concessionaires will be significant for attaining this objective. The publ ic planning should outli ne the targets and become co -responsible for the results to be achieved by the whole set of (private) operations on the integrated network, maximizing its economic effect. A physically and economically integrated network would allow the railroad to prepare itself for transporting general cargo and other services, expanding the economies of scope.", "The second strategic guideline for high performance is the impetus for transporting any type of cargo and toward intermodalism. The aim is to transport all types c argo in order", "to reduce the average idleness of the system and to encourage the administration of the railways toward an intermodal logistics operation. Establishing specific contractual targets that drive the transportation of gene ral cargo by the current concessionaires, whether directly or through partnerships with newcomers, would be significant to increase efficiency . It will require the railway companies to design a specific administration focused on transporting goods of a hig her added value and towa rd multimodal operations. The physical and economic integration of railways previously highlighted could enable the trains to circulate on routes of internal distribution, being competitive with the highway transportation and meetin g the needs of distribut ion logistics, going beyond the export routes to the ports, a characteristic of the rail transport in Brazil since the end of the 19th century. This will encourage intermodalism and the reduction of transportation costs, while requi ring rules for interoper ability, including standardizing the technical specifications for the control and safety of trains so that the compositions from different tracks can move freely along the network of the same gauge. To encourage the concessionaires to operate in the direct ion of transporting general cargo and intermodalism will increase SFBC’s efficiency.", "The third strategic guideline for high performance is a more efficient use of the assets granted, such as the railway track and the rolling stock. The suggestion is to mak e contractual mechanisms that aim to reduce the idleness and increasing the productivity of the rail track, the speed of the trains, and the use up -to-date and more efficient designs for the rolling stock, replacing the obsolete equ ipments that compromises the efficiency scores. Finally, the fourth strategic guideline for high performance refers to the market structure. The findings indicate that using the railway track in the monopoly structure reduces efficiency. The regulations sh ould pursue the shared u se of the railway sections and promoting the diversification of services and economies of scope. Regional services feeding the trunk lines, connecting granted subsystems, and new direct connections should be encouraged by regulation , such as the short line s railways in the US market. The sharing of the less idle sections, the most critical ones for the current concessionaires, and the policies to encourage competition by the entry of new providers would be significant for efficiency. The scenario of high pe rformance is similar to the models put into practice in the European Community based of Directive 91/440/EEC (EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 1991) and in the US, based on the theory of conte stable markets (BAUMOL; PANZAR; WILLIG, 1982)", "and on the Staggers Rail Act (US, 1980) . The removal of barriers to th e entry and exit from the market (passengers and cargo), the use of competitive processes in approving operators, the guarantee of no discretions in the tariff, the competitive allocation of slots, and the clarification of the relationship between state (g rant) and concessionaire s (revenue) in the transportation of passengers are the main guidelines of these models.", "These four strategic guidelines for achieving high performance in the Brazilian rail system should emerge from the strategic planning of the fe deral government, accomp anied with targets and timelines to guide the business planning of the private sector granted subsystems. Without a well -defined strategy, the moving from a medium performance scenario to a high performance scenario will be mostly c ompromised.", "In Brazil, h owever, the regulatory and contractual reforms as laid down in Law N o. 13,448 (BRAZIL, [s.d.]) are being carried out without long -term systemic targets being set in place. The main concessionaires have a regulatory incentive and want to extend the term of their current concession contract s that are linked to the increase of the outputs without significantly modifying the market struc ture of the current model, privileging investments to expand the scale instead of scope. The absence of previous definitions from the public administrator and a regulatory stimulus especially regarding the diversification of cargo and services, the incenti ve to competition, and sharing the railway track which are significant for increasing efficiency, brings the risk therefore of the high performance scenario no t being achieved, and, thus, perpetuating the characteristics of the current medium performance scenario. Based on the findings, the proposal of an early extension of the concession contracts in the rail sector as provided for in Law N o. 13,448 does not sh ow itself to be able to push the SBFC toward high performance.", "5.3 RECOMMENDATIONS REGARDING THE EFFI CIENCY EVALUATION", "METHODOLOGY The agencies that monitor, regulate, and inspect the public services, such as the railway's operation in Brazil, may use methods for assessing the relative efficiency of the service providers and for establishing efficiency r anking. The submission of annual efficiency reports based on methods widely accepted in the literature, such as DEA, are desirable to boost the operators to in crease efficiency and to identify the benchmarking", "DMUs that will become the operational referenc es for the others. The knowledge of more efficient operations in the Brazilian rail system based on scientific methodologies would facilitate, for an example, the public manager decision -making as to the appropriateness of early extensions of existing conc essions on the basis of Law N o. 13,448.", "Some precautions must be taken into account. The findings suggest that the number of variables used in the model of eva luating the efficiency frontier of the operators can significantly influence the results. The inc rease in the number of variables may also impose greater rigidity and complexity to the evaluation model, making it inadequate for its purpose. The variables s hould be selected with parsimony , selecting those that are widely applied in the sector. The resu lts found also indicated that the parametric models are statistically different from non -parametric models. In some cases, they can lead to higher scores than the non-parametric models. This can be explained by the sensitivity of non -parametric models such as DEA to the increase in the number of variables (COOPER; SEIF ORD; TONE, 2006) , the heterogeneity in the data from the DMUs, and the presence of outliers (KHEZRIMOTLAGH, 2013) . In these cases, there may also be a loss of discriminatory power or a sudden fall in the D EA scores. The existence of a random error in the parametric estimates from measuring data (BOGETOFT; OTTO, 2011) , statistical error, or other non- systematic influences (AMORNKITVIKAI; HARVIE, 2010) may also justify the statistical difference found, since the difference between the observations of combinations of inputs and ou tputs and the efficiency frontier in non -parametric and deterministic models such as DEA is f ully attributed to inefficiency. The deterministic approach tends to overestimate inefficiency. In these cases, the use of the DEA methodology can be complemented by other valuation techniques, including parametric models.", "5.4 LIMITATIONS AND SUGGESTIONS FOR F URTHER RESEARCH", "This research had as a limitation the existence of data from secondary sources. Parsimony should be used when defining the strategy used for select ing articles for the meta - analysis because it can exert an influence in the results. The appl ication of a meta -analysis in a productive sector requires, therefore, a considerable initial planning and may face constraints in estimating the variables initial ly selected, considering that part of the"]}

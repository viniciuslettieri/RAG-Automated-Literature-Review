Evidences on management of GDM by bioactive compounds and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) lead to the investigation of possible mechanisms related to their beneficial effects. Grape seed oil (GSO) is a food matrix rich on antioxidant compounds and linoleic acid and, therefore, may play an important role on managing GDM and placental function. Thus, the aim of this study was to use an in vitro human trophoblastic-like cell model, BeWo, to elucidate the mechanisms by which hyperglycemia combined or not with grape seed oil may influence on cell proliferation (1) and viability (2); glycolytic pathway (3); and gene expression related to glucose and mitochondrial metabolism (4); and ER stress (5) and autophagy (6); and total cell FA content. Cells were cultured on 5 mM glucose for 24 h, incubated for another 24 h with or without GSO (1 mg x mL-1), and then for more 24 h with, 5 mM, 10 mM or 20 mM glucose concentration. The methods used were: (1) total cell counting on Neubauer Chamber; (2) Trypan Blue method and MTT; (3) enzymatic assay for lactate determination; (4, 5 and 6) PCRq to evaluate the expression of genes; (7) FA profile of BeWo by gas chromatography (GC). GSO was chemically characterized through the FA content by GC, total phenolic compounds by Folin- Ciocalteu and total tocopherol and carotenoids by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). GSO had abundant unsatured fatty acids content, especially linoleic acid (LA), and contained α, γ, δ-tocopherol, β-carotene and presence of total phenolic compounds. High glucose concentrations resulted in a decrease in total cell number and GSO potentiated this decrease, not associated with cell death. High glucose and GSO had different effects on autophagy, ER stress and glucose and mitochondrial metabolism at each condition. GSO and high glucose stimulated glycolytic flux, with attenuation by GSO at 20 mM, possibly preventing an acidosis. GSO treatment lead to higher incorporation of LA at the cell’s membrane.

Gestational Diabetes Mellitus and placental function", "Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM) is defined as an intolerance to carbohydrate firstly diagnosed during pregnancy, persisting or not after delivery (MINISTÉRIO DA SAÚDE, 2010). GDM is the main metabolic disorder that occurs during pregnancy and, although it’s true prevalence is uncertain, it is estimated to affect 3 to 30% of pregnant women depending on the population studied and the diagnostic criteria used (DIABETES; IN, 2011). GDM’s physiopathology is related to physiological stress due to pregnancy, to genetic and environmental factors and to elevation in insulin counter-regulatory hormones (SOCIEDADE BRASILEIRA DE ENDOCRINOLOGIA E METABOLOGIA, 2005).", "Placental lactogens and growth hormone are examples of hormones secreted by the placenta that exert anti-insulin effects. They can promote lipolysis, boosting maternal glucose and free fatty acid concentrations for exchange to the fetus. For long, the human placenta was only superficially recognized as the discoid structure that interfaces with the mother as it is, in fact, remarkably difficult to be defined biologically. It is now known that the placenta is a multifaceted organ that performs the actions of all the major organ systems while these differentiate and mature in the fetus. The placenta is also a major endocrine organ, secreting more than 100 peptide and steroid hormones that modulate maternal physiology (BURTON; FOWDEN, 2015; BURTON; JAUNIAUX, 2015).", "Placental formation and development is a complex multistep process, that starts with the implantation in the endometrium of cytotrophoblastic cells, which fuse to form the syncytiotrophoblast (BASTIDA-RUIZ et al., 2017). Among placental cells, trophoblasts permit the implantation of the embryo and participate in specialized functions, such as hormone secretion, transport of nutrients and gases, and thereafter contribute considerably to the development and function of the placenta (AIRES, 2015; BASTIDA-RUIZ et al., 2017). Therefore, placental dysfunction can have immediate deleterious consequences during gestation, or influence the long term health of both the mother and child (BURTON; FOWDEN, Several studies have been published addressing the impact of diabetes on placental development and function (EDU et al., 2016; GÜL et al., 2015; TARICCO et al., 2003; ZORN et al., 2008). The underlying mechanisms are still unclear, but some evidence indicate alterations in trophoblast proliferation, apoptosis and cell cycle. The extra and intrauterine", "hyperglycemic environment leads to the development of an abnormal metabolic environment which affects the mother, the fetus and also the placenta (AIRES, 2015). Hyperglycemia and an altered maternal lipid profile can be extremely detrimental for causing dysfunction in the placenta (BURTON; FOWDEN, 2015).", "1.2. Placental metabolism and nutrient utilization", "The primary barrier limiting nutrient transfer across the human placenta is the syncytiotrophoblast. The syncytiotrophoblast has two polarized plasma membranes: a maternal-facing microvillous plasma membrane (MVM) and a basal plasma membrane (BM) faced to the fetal circulation. Both membranes express nutrient transporters, illustrated on Figure 1, which may be regulated by fetal, maternal, and placental signals (LAGER; POWELL,", "Figure 1. The syncytiotrophoblast represents the primary barrier for transfer of nutrients from mother to fetus. Maternal blood pools in the intervillous space and bathes the microvillous membrane. The basal plasma membrane of the syncytiotrophoblast is oriented toward the fetal circulation. Transporters mediating the transfer of amino acids, glucose (GLUTs), and fatty acids (FATPs) are expressed in both plasma membranes of the syncytiotrophoblast. For transfer of lipids, extracellular lipases release fatty acids from maternal lipoproteins and intracellular binding proteins (FABPs) guide the fatty acids within the cytosol of the syncytiotrophoblast (LAGER;", "Nutrients available on maternal blood may be transferred to the fetus or utilized by the placenta for its own metabolism as an energy source for the organ, conversion into alternative sources of fuel through different metabolic pathways (GALLO; BARRETT; DEKKER NITERT, 2017). While direct transfer to the fetus is often regarded as the predominant pathway, the placenta itself consumes nutrients and therefore its metabolic activity provides an important contribution to determining both the quality and quantity of nutrients available to fetus. Thus,", "consideration of placental metabolism per se is essential to understand how the placenta regulates nutrient transfer, energy balance and fetal growth, for example (MURALIMANOHARAN; MALOYAN; MYATT, 2016).", "Glucose is the primary source of energy for the fetus and the placenta. The placenta consumes at least one-third of the glucose taken up from the maternal circulation. Since fetal gluconeogenesis is not significant, the fetus is critically dependent on the facilitated carrier- mediated diffusion process via the family of facilitated glucose transporters (GLUTs) (GALLO; BARRETT; DEKKER NITERT, 2017). In the human syncytiotrophoblast, isoform GLUT1 is expressed in both membrane fractions but there is a three-to four-fold greater expression in the microvillous versus basal membranes (GALLO; BARRETT; DEKKER NITERT, 2017).", "In the first half of pregnancy, the density of GLUT1 in the basal membrane increases, stagnating for the remaining gestational period, suggesting that early pregnancy determines fetal demands for glucose transfer. And any impairment in GLUT1 expression in this period might be critical for fetal growth and related processes. GLUT1 is primarily localized to the syncytiotrophoblast but also expressed in cytotrophoblasts and fetal endothelial cells. GLUT3 is expressed in fetal arterial endothelial cells. GLUT 4 and GLUT 9 are also significantly expressed and other GLUT isoforms are either absent or expressed at very low levels in the human placenta (GALLO; BARRETT; DEKKER NITERT, 2017).", "In vitro experiments demonstrate that about 25% of glucose entering the placenta is metabolized within this tissue, predominately into lactate via anaerobic glycolysis, and the remaining 75% is delivered unchanged to the fetus. Around 75% of the lactate formed by anaerobic glycolysis is released on the fetal side (HAUGUEL-DE MOUZON et al., 2001). In vivo, under physiological conditions, the placenta consumes large amounts of oxygen, not essential for tissue survival, however, as there are specific mechanisms of adjustment allowing functioning under low oxygen conditions (SCHNEIDER, 2000). In women with pre-existing diabetes or GDM, it has been shown that placental activity of mitochondrial electron transport chain complexes was reduced. In GDM, mitochondrial oxygen consumption was reduced, along with increased placental expression of glycolytic enzymes and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), a known marker of anaerobic glycolysis (GALLO; BARRETT; DEKKER NITERT,", "1.2.1 Mitochondria, Endoplasmic Reticulum stress, autophagy and Placental function", "The syncytiotrophoblast of the human placenta is a highly dynamic tissue, performing a wide range of energy-demanding functions essential for the maintenance of a successful pregnancy. Therefore, the syncytiotrophoblast has a large number of mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The demands on these organelles vary depending on the stage of gestation, and in response to maternal and fetal signaling. Both mitochondria and the ER must be capable of adaptive responses, and given their roles the signaling pathways involved are central to the maintenance of placental energetic homeostasis (BURTON; YUNG; MURRAY, Mitochondria are widely recognized for providing most of energy production in the vast majority of eukaryotic cells through their production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). In the syncytiotrophoblast they have additional important functions as the site of synthesis of steroid hormones, as well as being involved in the transport and metabolism of cholesterol and are likely to play a central role in placental implantation, growth, and development. Mitochondria are also known to be highly dynamic organelles, forming a network that undergoes continual fission and fusion, altering their morphology and with it their function. Mitochondrial defects may cause the impairment of trophoblasts that leads to the severe placental disorder (BURTON; YUNG; MURRAY, 2017; YU et al., 2016).", "Syncytiotrophoblast mitochondria have been reported to have a reduced coupling control of oxidative phosphorylation to ATP production in comparison to cytotrophoblast mitochondria, as well as reduced cardiolipin content, which is important in efficient oxidative phosphorylation. There is also evidence that mitochondria are directly involved in the differentiation of cytotrophoblasts into the syncytiotrophoblast. In primary villous cytotrophoblasts, inhibition of the mitochondrial respiratory chain lead to a decrease in cell fusion and hormonal production (human chorionic gonadotropin and leptin). Lactate production also appeared to be temporarily increased during cytotrophoblast differentiation, suggesting that anaerobic metabolism is important during differentiation (HOLLAND et al., 2017). Almost all cellular energy is produced through oxidative phosphorylation in the mitochondria. Through redox reactions, electrons are transferred releasing energy and transporting protons into the mitochondrial intermembrane space through respiratory complexes (complexes I, III, and IV). The electrochemical gradient created by the transfer of protons is called mitochondrial membrane potential and is utilized by ATP synthase (complex V) to transform adenosine diphosphate (ADP) into ATP, in a phosphorylation reaction.", "Mitochondria are known as the powerhouse of the cell due to their central role in ATP generation (HOLLAND et al., 2017).", "Activity of complexes I and III were found to be reduced in the whole placenta from women with type 1 diabetes and combined activity of complexes II and III were reduced in type 2 diabetes (HASTIE; LAPPAS, 2014). In individuals with diabetes, there are studies reporting alterations in mitochondrial content, respiratory function, and complex activity in non- gestational tissues. However, the studies examining specific mitochondrial changes in the placenta are still limited (HOLLAND et al., 2017).", "Mitochondria also plays a central role in controlling cell survival and death pathways. This is due, mainly, for the regulation of caspase activation and through changes in mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization leading to the release of various mitochondrial intermembrane space proteins that activate caspases, resulting in apoptosis. The alterations on permeabilization per se may lead to cell death, independently from caspase activation, showing mitochondria central role ate this process (TAIT; GREEN, 2013).", "Physiological connections between mitochondria and ER are mainly mediated through Ca2+ signaling. Mitochondrial and ER membranes connect physically and biochemically at punctate sites, similar to synapses in the nervous system, referred to collectively as the mitochondria associated ER membrane (MAM). The evidence of considerable cross-talk between the two indicates that they operate as an integrated unit, making it unlikely that any alteration occurs in isolation (BURTON; YUNG; MURRAY, 2017). Attention has focused on mitochondria within the syncytiotrophoblast, and more recently the ER, due to their involvement in placental stress (YUNG et al., 2016).", "ER is the cell organelle mainly responsible for protein biosynthetic processes and has a dominant role in maintaining redox and lipid homeostasis; hence, its proper functioning also determines lipid metabolism. The main physiological regulatory system that affect ER homeostasis is ER stress, and its related signaling network, unfolded protein response (UPR). In an aberrant degree, ER stress may result in a pathological process and has been recently shown to be a common mechanism of GDM (MANDL et al., 2013).", "ER stress pathways aim to restore ER homeostasis, which involves protein kinase RNA- like ER kinase (PERK)–eukaryotic initiation factor 2 subunit α (eIF2α), which attenuates non- essential protein synthesis, and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6) and inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1)–X-box binding protein 1 (XBP-1), which increase protein folding capacity, schematically represented on figure 2 below.", "Figure 2. Diagrammatic representation of the signaling pathways activated in the unfolded protein response (UPR) following endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress . The sensor molecules PERK, ATF6, and IRE1 are transmembrane proteins normally held inactive by the binding of GRP78, but are released when GRP78 preferentially binds to misfolded proteins accumulating in the ER lumen. The UPR aims to restore homeostasis within the ER, but there are also links to the inflammatory response through the IRE1 pathway. ATF6: activating transcription factor 6; GRP78: glucose-regulated protein 78; IRE1: inositol-requiring 1; PERK: PKR-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (FU et al., 2015).", "Yung and colleagues first demonstrated the existence of ER stress in placentas from GDM pregnancies by showing an increase in eIF2α phosphorylation (YUNG et al., 2016). Many of these proteins are also involved in the processes of mitochondrial fission and fusion, suggesting that modulation of mitochondrial morphology in response to stress is a further function of the ER. If these pathways fail to restore homeostasis, apoptosis is activated to eliminate the damaged cells (YUNG et al., 2016). ER stress may also initiate a complex signaling response, critical to the regulation of lipid homeostasis, membrane turnover, and autophagy (MANDL et al., 2013).", "Autophagy is a self-degradative mechanism where senescent, damaged or redundant organelles or portion of cytoplasm are sequestered in a double-membrane vesicle called autophagosome that fuse with lysosomes to allow material breakdown and recycling (AVAGLIANO et al., 2017). Although autophagy has been related to the development of metabolic disorders, its role is not constrained to stress adaptation and survival mechanisms, being also responsible for degradation of glycogen in neonates, for instance (MANDL et al., Autophagy is also activated by glucose privation and is considered a catabolic process involved in the preservation of energy homeostasis and its dysregulation has been implicated in the development of metabolic disorders, including diabetes mellitus. (AVAGLIANO et al.,", "2017). Autophagy is also critical for normal placental development, such as the deep invasion of extra villous trophoblasts into the perivascular region during pregnancy. The mechanisms of the autophagic effects on early placental development in GDM, on the other hand, remain poorly understood (JI et al., 2017).", "Recent studies have revealed that lipid metabolism is intricately regulated by autophagy. The double layer lipid membrane of autophagosomes, illustrated on figure 3, most likely originates from two main sources, the ER and mitochondria. Given the central function of ER in lipid metabolism, it is reasonable to assume that autophagy and ER work together in a delicate balanced manner in the metabolism of lipids; however, no experimental data have yet proved this connection (MANDL et al., 2013).", "Figure 3. Autophagosome formation in autophagy. In macroautophagy, the cargoes are sequestered within a unique double layer lipid membrane cytosolic vesicle, called autophagosome (MIZUSHIMA et al., 2008).", "1.2.2 Placental lipid metabolism", "Lipid metabolism may also suffer a wide range of disturbances in diabetic pregnancy, affecting the quantity and quality of lipids provided to the fetus (HERRERA; DESOYE, 2016). Yet, the placental lipid content also depends on maternal supply. Placental adaptation to maternal metabolic conditions has resulted in altered fatty acid (FA) metabolism and placental incorporation during pregnancy. Therefore, maternal dyslipidemia status may be expected to alter lipid composition in placental tissue (SEGURA et al., 2017). In maternal circulation there are free FAs, cholesterol and esterified FAs, being the last two associated with lipoproteins (GALLO; BARRETT; DEKKER NITERT, 2017). Once taken up by the placenta, FAs may enter various metabolic routes, including β-oxidation, conversion into eicosanoids, and re-esterification to form phospholipids and triglycerides that may be", "stored in lipid droplets. FAs may also be released into fetal circulation (HERRERA; DESOYE, The vast majority of fatty acids in the maternal circulation are esterified and are hydrolyzed by lipoprotein lipase and endothelial lipase. After hydrolysis, FA are taken up by the placenta through fatty acids transport proteins (FATP), shown in Figure 1. Once inside the syncytiotrophoblast, the FA must be bound to fatty acids bounding proteins (FABP) to be transferred to the fetus or metabolized by the placenta, as better viewed on figure 4 (HERRERA;", "Figure 4. Schematic diagram of the putative roles of fatty acid binding/transporter proteins in human placental fatty acid uptake and metabolism. The location of FAT and FATP on both sides of the bipolar placental cells and the lack of specificity for particular types of FFAs allows Transport by all free fatty acids (FFAs) (non-essential, essential and long-chain polyunsaturated) occurs bidirectionally, i.e. from the mother to the fetus and vice versa. p-FABPpm sequesters maternal plasma LCPUFAs to the placenta. Cytoplasmic FABPs may be responsible for transcytoplasmic movement of FFAs to their sites of esterification, ß-oxidation, or to the fetal circulation via placental basal membranes.", "Although glucose oxidation is regarded as the primary pathway for energy production, the important role of mitochondrial FA oxidation for placental and fetal metabolism has recently been recognized (HERRERA; DESOYE, 2016). In healthy placental explants, glucose can be incorporated as triglycerides (TG). A recent study reported that placental explants from GDM pregnancies had a two to three-fold higher glucose uptake and a 50% reduction in FA oxidation when compared to non-GDM placentas. Placenta from normoglycemic pregnancies cultured in high glucose had reduced FA oxidation, along with increased esterification and accumulation of TG (VISIEDO et al., 2013).", "1.2.3 Essential Fatty acids, placental function and fetal development", "FAs are a source of energy, essential structural elements of cellular membranes, and are precursors for important bioactive compounds. Practically all FAs can provide energy, but structural and metabolic functions mainly require polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) of the n-3 or n-6 series (HERRERA; DESOYE, 2016). The long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFAs) are of particular importance for the development of the fetus brain. Maternal TGs have been suggested as a primary source of FAs because of their substantial increase in late gestation compared to non-esterified fatty acids (NEFAs) (LAGER; POWELL, 2012). There are two classes of essential FA, n-3 and n-6 series. The distinction between them is based on the location of the first double bond of the FA molecule. Linoleic acid (LA) (18:2 n-6) and α-linolenic acid (ALA) (18:3 n-3) are essential fatty acids that must be derived from the diet as they cannot be synthetized by humans. LA can be metabolized to arachidonic acid (AA) (20:4ω6) while ALA can be metabolized to eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) (20:5ω3) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) (22:6ω3), among others. This is achieved by increasing the chain length and the degree of unsaturation through elongases and desaturases enzymes (SIMOPOULOS, 2016).", "For the fetus, LCPUFAs are obtained from the maternal circulation and are essential for development, especially DHA and AA, which are crucial for intrauterine development and specific functions such as retinal and cerebral development. The placenta regulates adequate LCPUFA delivery to the fetus in a directional, preferential and timely manner, preferentially transferring n-3 LCPUFA. Interestingly, the human placenta has a preference for the transport of DHA over AA, ALA, and LA (HERRERA; DESOYE, 2016; SANTANGELO et al., 2016). Many studies have investigated the effects of isolated FAs in the placenta, specially LCPUFA. DHA has been shown to be involved in promoting angiogenesis, stimulating trophoblast proliferation and invasion, and AA in promoting pro-inflammatory effects and reducing cell proliferation (BASAK; DAS; DUTTAROY, 2013). On the other hand, there is no report on the literature about the effects of those PUFA in human placenta cells, when provided as complex oil matrix.", "In the literature, the data is still controversial about the effects of different types of FA on human health. Some researchers indicated that maternal dietary supplementation with n-3 PUFA during pregnancy can reduce the risk of pregnancy complications by limiting placental inflammation and oxidative stress, with positive action on insulin function, improvement of glucose tolerance and lipid profiles (SANTANGELO et al., 2016). It has been shown that n-6", "PUFA intake is closely associated with and inflammatory response via AA-activated pathways. On the other hand, these FA have important role in homeostasis, regulating resolution and promotion of inflammation in immune response (SHINAGAWA et al., 2015).", "The proportion of fatty acids on the maternal side of the syncytiotrophoblast that are transferred to the fetal circulation is mainly unknown. An in vivo study with labeled FA with 13C-stable isotopes administered to the mother prior to delivery by cesarean section determined the enrichment of the 13C-labeled FAs in the cord blood (PAGAN et al., 2013). Palmitic acid (PA, 16:0), oleic acid (OA, 18:1 n-9), LA (18:2 n-6), and DHA (22:6 n-3) were evaluated. Interestingly, only about 0.5% of the fatty acids administered to the mother were enriched in the fetal circulation. The exception was DHA, which was enriched by 3.5%. Corroborating the fact that placental FA metabolism must be taken into account when evaluating the delivery of lipids to the fetus.", "In rats induced with a mild hyperglycemia, placental fatty acids metabolism in total tissue was modified but in a different way than in placental mitochondria. Whereas the chronic mild hyperglycemia induced a decrease in unsaturated to saturated fatty acids ratio (U/S) in placental total tissue, this ratio increased in placental mitochondria. This was accompanied by an increase in mitochondrial membrane fluidity and lipoperoxidation, and a decrease in mitochondrial function (FIGUEROA-GARCÍA, 2015).", "It has already been demonstrated that the human placenta adapts to mild maternal diabetes by limiting placental glucose transfer, and consequently protecting the fetus to a certain degree from excessive glucose exposure. In contrast, knowledge on adaptations of placental FA metabolism in response to GDM is lacking (SEGURA et al., 2017). Interestingly, it is know that the fetus does not seem to receive more quantity of FAs in maternal GDM than in non- GDM pregnancies (HERRERA; DESOYE, 2016). Although lipid metabolism is modified and EFA transfer to the fetus is impaired. Specifically, DHA transfer is decreased to the fetus and alterations in placental phospholipids composition has been demonstrated (PRIETO- SÁNCHEZ et al., 2017; UHL et al., 2015). Leading to the investigation of different nutrients role on GDM placentas.", "1.3 Dietary lipids and Grape Seed Oil", "There is increasing evidence that the dietary patterns that have beneficial effects both in the prevention and management of diabetes are characterized by high consumption of plant foods (e.g. whole grains, fruit, nuts, vegetables and extra-virgin olive oil) and low consumption", "of animal-based, high-fat, processed foods. Among the known natural bioactive components, polyphenols have been shown to have anti-hyperglycemic effects, antioxidant and anti- inflammatory activities and no side effects. In addition, the increasing demand of non-fish source of n-3 PUFA is worth considering, in view of the beneficial effects of these FA in GDM women, and during pregnancy in general, not to mention the worldwide increase in the number of vegetarians and vegans (SANTANGELO et al., 2016).", "Safe-to-eat vegetable oils, as grape seed oil (GSO), may be an alternative on conventional food sources (AGOSTINI et al., 2012). GSO is rich on polyunsaturated PUFA and other bioactive compounds as tocopherols, tocotrienols, flavonoids, phenolic acids and carotenoids. Other minority compounds largely found in their compositions are phytosterols, such as β-sitosterol, campesterol and stigmasterol (SHINAGAWA et al., 2015). Additionally, when extracted by cold press, the oil presents a vinous and fruity aroma (MATTHÄUS, 2008). LA is the most abundant FA present in GSO, ranging from 67 to 78% of all FAs (BADA et al., 2015; BEVERIDGE et al., 2005; SHINAGAWA et al., 2015). LA content on GSO seems to be more abundant than in other vegetable oils, namely: sunflower oil (around 60%), corn (around 52%) and soybeans (around 50%) (AGOSTINI et al., 2012; SHINAGAWA et al., 2015). LA itself is associated with promotion of cardiovascular health by down-regulating low- density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c) production and, on the other hand, overconsumption of n-6 source related to n-3 has been implicated in increased AA production and inflammatory overactivation (SHINAGAWA et al., 2015). Several studies have been addressing the effect of GSO on biological aspects as follows.", "In overweight and/or obese women, GSO consumption led to an improvement in inflammation and in insulin resistance. The beneficial effects were attributed to tocotrienols and phenolic components of the oil, as the consumption of sunflower oil, similar on FAs content, showed no effect on these parameters (IRANDOOST; EBRAHIMI-MAMEGHANI; PIROUZPANAH, 2013).", "In rats fed with GSO, a significant reduction in total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein cholesterol, and atherogenic index, was observed compared to soybeans oil and lard group. These data suggest that GSO supplementation has significant health benefits through favorable alterations in plasma lipid profiles and may provide health benefits in hyperlipidemia and related complications. These results were also attributed to higher tocotrienol and polyphenol contents (KIM et al., 2010). Mokhtar and colleagues also observed that GSO improved blood lipids and atherogenic lipid profile in hypercholesterolemic rats (MOKHTAR et al., 2016).", "On a histopathological study, pretreatment with GSO protected the liver against induced hepatotoxicity (UMA MAHESWARI; RAO, 2005). Additionally, on a primary human adipocyte-derived stem cell line a muscadine GSO led to reduced accumulation of triglyceride and a tocotrienol rich fraction of the same oil significantly reduced the messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) and protein expression that are crucial to adipogenesis and to inflammation When studying cold-pressed chardonnay, muscadine, ruby red, and concord grape seed oils, only muscadine seed oil registered significant dose dependent inhibition of cancer cell growth (LUTTERODT et al., 2011). Another study with GSO showed protection of β-cells from high glucose-induced apoptosis and found that its protective activity may be linked to mitochondrial pathways, ER stress pathway and the Fas signal pathway (LAI et al., 2014). Besides all literature data, in general, grape seeds are not used to produce oil and are often referred to as a significant agricultural and industrial waste (BADA et al., 2015). The agribusiness in Brazil produces large amounts of residues, considered an environmental issue. However, these residues are becoming attractive for producing high value products (AGOSTINI et al., 2012). Approximately 25% (w/w) of grapes content relates to dry pomace, of which about 38% (w/w) is seed. The seed may contain 10-15% oil, a potential high value by-product of wine and juice manufacture (BEVERIDGE et al., 2005).", "A recent published paper from our research group showed that Pinot noir grape pomace extract from an industrial white winemaking process induced early metabolic changes on human hepatocarcinoma HepG2 cells. The results suggested that the grape pomace extract, a by-product of winemaking, may present important pharmacological properties, with potential future use as functional and nutraceutical food ingredients, targeting mitochondria (DE SALES In that manner, it becomes relevant the investigation of the effects of a complex food matrix, such as GSO, as a potential nutraceutical food ingredient.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION", "4.1 Grape seed oil as a source of unsatured fatty acids and bioactive compounds", "GSO was characterized as a complex food matrix, rich in unsatured fatty acids and antioxidant compounds. Table 2 presents the data for fatty acids, total phenolic compounds, tocopherols and -carotene. Representative GC and HPLC chromatograms of GSO are shown in Figure 5, where the major fatty acids and major tocopherols are indicated by peak numbers. Linoleic acid was the major fatty acid in GSO, corresponding to 67% of total lipid content, followed by oleic acid, corresponding to almost 21% of total fatty acids. Unsaturated fatty acids comprised almost 90% of all fatty acids in GSO (Table 2).", "All literature data found on GSO also appoints linoleic acid (LA) as the major compound present in the oil, ranging from 66 to 78% of all FA. Just as seen in this study, oleic acid (OA) is the second major compound, followed by palmitic acid (PA) (AGOSTINI et al., 2012; BADA et al., 2015; BEVERIDGE et al., 2005; LAI et al., 2014; LUTTERODT et al., 2011; MATTHÄUS, 2008; SHINAGAWA et al., 2015).", "It was also possible to identify several bioactive compounds such as α, γ, δ-tocopherol, β- carotene and presence of total phenolic compounds (Table 2). In vitro and animal studies have shown that almost all subclasses of flavonoids and other phenolics such as curcumin and resveratrol, were able to modulate several molecular pathways involved in insulin sensitivity in the context of GDM (CHOI et al., 2008; FIORI et al., 2013; LEE et al., 2011; SONG et al., Although, during the oil pressing process, the majority of phenolic compounds remains in the residue, because of their limited solubility in the oil. It has been shown that the press cake was found to have about 2,000-fold higher phenolic compounds concentration (MATTHÄUS, 2008). Nevertheless, expressive amounts of phenolic compounds were found in different grape oils varieties from different harvests, ranging from 1.23 to 2.37 GAE mg/100g oil, similar to the amount found at this study (AGOSTINI et al., 2012).", "Bada and colleagues analyzed eight varieties of grape seed oil and found the presence of α, β and γ-tocopherol. α-tocopherol was the main tocopherol found, ranging from 2.15 to 3.82 mg/100g of oil, followed by γ-tocopherol (0.34-1.59) and β-tocopherol (0.03-0.1). β- sitosterol and α-tocotrienol were also detected in the oil (BADA et al., 2015). Freitas and colleagues evaluated α-tocopherol in six varieties of grape seed oil and found a range from 0.1 to 5.67 mg/100g oil (DOS SANTOS FREITAS et al., 2008). Beveridge and colleagues analyzed", "eight varieties of grapes seed oils by two methods and the oils contained α, β and γ-tocopherols and α and γ-tocotrienols (BEVERIDGE et al., 2005). Those results show that the concentration of these compounds depend on the grape variety and environmental cultivation conditions. Additionally, Agostini and colleagues found the Bordô grape variety, the same used at this study, to have the highest concentrations of fatty acids, procyanidins, total phenolics (2.37 GAE mg/100g oil), and α-tocopherol (0.65-1.32 mg/100g oil), in comparison to other varieties, demonstrating high potential for oil extraction and bioactivity from this Brazilian grape variety (AGOSTINI et al., 2012).", "There is increasing evidence indicating the beneficial effect of dietary polyunsaturated fatty acids during pregnancy (OSTADRAHIMI et al., 2016; SAMIMI et al., 2015; SANTANGELO et al., 2016). On the other hand, there is not enough data to make assumptions on dietary recommendations of these compounds for pregnant women.

Although a subtle 1.3-fold increase in cell number was observed at 20 mM glucose, no statistical difference was found. This decrease in cell number in the presence of high glucose and GSO was not associated with cell death, since non-viable cells determined by the Trypan blue exclusion assay remained as low as 10 % of total cells, for both conditions (data not shown). Therefore, the decrease in cell number was not associated with alterations in cell membrane permeability, which might indicate necrotic cell death. These results suggest that incubation with GSO led to lower cell proliferation rate at 5 mM and 10 mM glucose. At 20 mM glucose, however, it seems that this decrease in cell number might be attenuated by GSO incubation.", "Figure 6.

This effect did not persist after 48 hours, indicating some capacity of the cells to adapt their responses to the altered metabolic environment, as on our study. On JAR cell line no difference was found between normal e hyperglycemia (WEISS et al., 2001).

The authors observed stimulation of autophagy and apoptosis, indicating possible mechanisms for the reduction on proliferation, which also encouraged our investigation on autophagic genes in order to try to understand the mechanisms leading to reduction on cell proliferation. GSO also seems to act in decreasing cell proliferation, even on other cell lines. On pancreatic β-cell, GSO reduced apoptosis by down-regulating pro-apoptotic genes and up- regulating anti-apoptotic genes (LAI et al., 2014). Although evaluated on cancer cell line, from four different types of grape seed oils, only the muscadine one exhibited significant dose dependent inhibition of cell growth, indicating that the GSO may have different effects on different cell types (LUTTERODT et al., 2011).", "Despite the consequences on pregnancy outcomes of reduced trophoblast proliferation, it has been shown that increased placental size on maternal diabetes both humans and rats and was associated with altered placental histology and cellularity (AIRES, 2015; ZORN et al., 2008).

When evaluating solely the effect of glucose (Figure 7B, black bars), it was observed a 2.6 and 7.6-fold increase at 10 mM and 20 mM glucose respectively, when compared to 5 mM. These results indicate an increase in the metabolic activity per cell as a function of glucose concentration, despite the decrease in cell number (Figure 6A). Incubation with GSO promoted a 2.9 and 2.6-fold increase in the metabolic activity at 10 mM and 20 mM glucose respectively, when compared to 5 mM +GSO.

No differences were observed at 20 mM glucose +GSO. These results suggest that high glucose concentration may play a role on inducing autophagy via ATG-5 and ATG-7, and that incubation with GSO may have more pronounced effects on ATG-7 at 5 mM glucose, but at 20 mM glucose, ATG-7 gene expression was decreased in the presence of GSO.", "Avagliano and colleagues evaluated the expression of LC3 protein and gene in the syncytiotrophoblast of human placentas from mothers with and without GDM and found a higher protein content and a lower LC3 gene expression. These results indicate that gene expression must be critically analyzed since protein content and function are not always necessarily related to it and other aspects must be evaluated in order to evaluate the regulation of a pathway. Although the authors indicated that LC3 protein content may be related to protein accumulation due to impaired vesicles degradation, showing an alteration of the autophagy process in diabetic pregnancy, they did not indicated a causal relationship (AVAGLIANO et al., 2017).

These results indicate the importance of ATG-5, as its inactivation effectively blocks the autophagy pathway (JI et al., 2017). The increase of ATG-5 expression on hyperglycemia, found at our study, may indicate a further activation of autophagy at this condition, with inhibition when GSO is present. Our results show a major increase on gene expression for ATG-7, followed by ATG-5 and a subtle increase for LC3B at high glucose concentrations.

This process will permit the translation of proapoptotic proteins and accumulation of more unfolded proteins in the ER, thus amplifying the ER stress and UPR (BASTIDA-RUIZ et al., 2017). Our results showed that 10 and 20 mM glucose promoted similar effects on PERK and EIF2α expression, where a subtle increase in the range of 30-40 % was observed when compared to 5 mM (Figure 9A, black bars).

Previous research has demonstrated beneficial effects of IRE 1 on placental development and its inactivation leading to embryonic death after 12.5 days of gestation in mice, demonstrating the importance of this protein during placentation. IRE 1 activation is necessary for the expression by trophoblastic cells of vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A), which acts as an inducer of angiogenesis (IWAWAKI et al., 2009). In this study, both high glucose and GSO had little or no effect on the expression of IRE 1 gene, probably having no or small impact on angiogenesis.", "ER stress in GDM placenta was first identified by Yung and colleagues (YUNG et al., 2016). Dilation of ER cisternae and increased phosphorylation of EIF2α was observed in the placenta samples of GDM women and the same pathways were activated when BeWo cell line was challenged at a high glucose medium, due to acidosis and not glucose concentration per se. ER stress at this condition was ameliorated by the addition of chemical chaperones and vitamins C and E combined. Furthermore, adding palmitic acid to BeWo cells during a high glucose challenge did not exacerbate the ER stress, indicating that high levels of fatty acids are unlikely to be a causative factor. On our study, the results on EIF2α gene expression, suggest that the higher the glucose concentration, the more GSO may attenuate its expression. These effects are due to the whole oil composition, which contain in addition to fatty acids, high content of antioxidant compounds.", "There is increasing unequivocal data indicating that the interaction between the mediators of mitochondrial fusion and the ER is essential for regulating cell function, particularly in the context of diabetes and obesity (ARRUDA; DISEASES, 2015).

The extensive complement of both organelles in the syncytiotrophoblast is necessary to meet its high metabolic and synthetic activities, as placenta tissue is vulnerable to oxidative and ER stress (BURTON; YUNG; MURRAY, 2017). Therefore, pathological conditions that disrupt the mitochondria-ER cross talk in the placenta might negatively impact gestational outcomes, as in GDM (Yung et al., The results presented on figure 7 showed that high glucose promoted an increase in BeWo metabolic activity. In this sense, one hypothesis is that the exacerbated metabolic activity may be related to higher mitochondrial metabolism, therefore the expression of MFN 1 and MFN 2 and Nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT), a protein involved in NAD synthesis, where investigated (Figure 10).", "Similar effects of glucose and glucose +GSO were found for both mitofusins. 10 and 20 mM glucose did not affect mitofusins expression when compared to 5 mM (Figure 10A and B, black bars).

Therefore, the decrease in BeWo cells number after incubation with GSO presented in Figure 6 could partially be explained by the decrease in MFN 2 expression, reinforcing MFN2 role in trophoblast viability, possibly acting as part of the molecular mechanisms underlying mitochondrial dysfunction.", "On the other hand, MFNs seem not to be involved in the decrease in BeWo proliferation promoted by glucose in the absence of GSO and other mechanisms might be involved. Mitochondrial dynamics have been implicated in the regulation of apoptosis and induction of cell death is associated with fragmentation of the mitochondrial network (CHEN et al., 2003). Therefore, the involvement of apoptosis and other death/survival pathways on the effects of glucose and GSO on BeWo cells needs further investigation. One possibility is the signaling promoted by reactive oxygen species, since MFN 2 is a strong regulator of metabolism and its deficiency is associated with altered redox responses, insulin resistance, and ER stress (YU et Interestingly, MFN2 and NAMPT expression increased in the condition 5 mM +GSO when compared to the condition 5 mM (Figures 10B and C), despite the increase in ATG7, PERK and eIF2- .

High glucose concentration (Figure 11A, black bars) led to a 2.2-fold increase in lactate accumulation at 10 mM and an 8-fold at 20 mM glucose respectively, when compared to 5 mM glucose. In the presence of GSO, 10 mM and 20 mM also induced a significant 5.8 and 5.6-fold increase, respectively, in glycolytic flux when compared to 5 mM glucose +GSO (Figure 11B,", "gray bars). The ratio +GSO:GSO show that GSO potentiated the increase in lactate accumulation at 5 mM and 10 mM glucose, where the increase was 2.7 and 2.5-fold increase, respectively (Figure 11C, white bars). On the other hand, at 20 mM, GSO promoted a significant decrease of about 32 % (Figure 11C, white bars) in lactate accumulation. These results suggest that although GSO stimulated glycolytic flux at 5 mM and 10 mM glucose, at 20 mM, it may play a role on attenuating the toxic effect of glucose on BeWo cells, possibly preventing a metabolic acidosis that might be caused by non-controlled glycemia, a common feature of GMD.", "Yung and colleagues first identification of ER stress in patients with GDM concluded that high concentration of lactate was the cause of placental stress, as previously discussed. Interestingly, they showed that the ER stress observed in BeWo cells under high glucose not only reduced by protein chaperones, but also by vitamins C and E. The addition of these vitamins was also able to prevent the increase in lactate, as well as the acidosis (YUNG et al., 2016).

The human placenta expresses all five isozymes of lactate dehydrogenase, which", "catalyzes the inter-conversion of lactate and pyruvate in the glycolytic pathway. The amount of lactate produced by the placenta was shown to be directly proportional to the maternal glucose concentration, as elevation of the glucose concentration from 4.2 to 10.9 mmol/l during placental perfusion in vitro induced a 4-fold increase in lactate production (YUNG et al., 2016). These results, with possible clinical implications, may be correlated to the magnitude of the increase in lactate accumulation observed in our results and encourage further research in the search for food components or whole food that prevents placental alterations in GDM pregnancies. Importantly, the results of both studies suggest anaerobic glycolysis as a basic mechanism that can be relevant to the functional alterations induced by GDM, to the placenta and consequently to the fetus.", "Glycolysis is in fact an inefficient pathway since only two ATP molecules are produced for each molecule of glucose metabolized. However, recent evidence suggests that lactate may be produced for several specific cellular metabolic functions, not only as a mere by-product of glycolysis. Lactate may also serve as a fuel for aerobic metabolism by the fetus. It has additional properties leading to cellular functions such as, inhibition of apoptosis, increasing the production of collagen in fibroblast culture, inducing vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) production and secretion in several cell types including placenta trophoblast cells. Therefore, anaerobic or aerobic glycolysis may be an adaptive metabolic pathway in the placenta because the increased lactate may serve several other important physiologic functions. In this sense, lactate levels were approximately 2-fold higher in women with severe preeclampsia compared to normal pregnant women. Also, in JEG3 cells cultured under hypoxia, lactate secretion was higher, as observed in our study (KAY; ZHU; TSOI, 2007). Therefore, not only the decrease in lactate accumulation induced by GSO might be related to attenuation of acidosis but also to decreased signaling through other pathways involved in placental dysfunction.", "The results on the effects of hyperglycemic stress on the glycolytic flux led us to investigate further glucose metabolism on BeWo cells. GLUT isoform 1 (constitutive glucose transporter, highly expressed in BeWo cells) and hexokinase isoform I (HK 1), the enzyme that catalyzes the first reaction of glycolysis expression were then evaluated.

The increase in glycolytic flux observed at 10 and 20 mM glucose (Figure 11A) might be explained by the increase in HK 1 expression. On the other hand, other mechanisms rather than increased glucose uptake due to GLUT 1 activity and increased glucose phosphorylation, due to HK 1 activity, might be taking place to account for the increase in lactate accumulation after glucose incubation in the presence of GSO.

Thus, the authors suggested that the alterations of placental autophagy in GDM are not associated with the mechanism through which glucose is transported across the placenta (AVAGLIANO et al., 2017). At our study autophagy and GLUT 1 expression seems to be correlated just at 20 mM GSO, as this condition was the only which presented higher GLUT 1 gene expression and ATG-5 and ATG-7 increased gene expression.", "Ericsson and colleagues investigated the expression of GLUT 1, 3 and 4 in first trimester villous tissue exposed to high insulin, in an attempt to mimic the milieu observed in diabetes. In the first trimester, GLUT 1 was present in the microvillous membrane of the syncytiotrophoblast (Figure 1) and the in the cytotrophoblasts. In the term placenta, GLUT1 expression was predominantly in the syncytiotrophoblast. The expression of other glucose transporter isoforms, such as GLUT 3 and GLUT 4, was either very little or absence, supporting the view that GLUT 1 is the primary GLUT isoform mediating transplacental transport in late gestation. Furthermore, the high level of expression of GLUT 1 in the placental barrier in the first trimester indicates an important role for this transporter in mediating placental transport of glucose also in early pregnancy. The authors speculated that high levels of insulin in early pregnancy may increase placental glucose uptake by recruiting insulin-sensitive glucose transporters to the maternal-facing micro villous membrane (ERICSSON et al., 2005). GLUT 1 activity is not dependent upon insulin signaling and increases with increasing glucose concentrations over a physiological range. It is known that saturation of the transporter occurs at high glucose concentrations, even though the maximum concentration is unknown (OSMOND et al., 2000). Our study has found increased GLUT 1 gene expression at 20 mM glucose, suggesting its possible role on increasing glucose uptake. GSO, on the other hand, seemed to reduce glucose uptake by downregulating GLUT1 gene expression at each glucose concentration. Maternal hyperglycemia is likely to result in increased transfer of glucose across the syncytiotrophoblast to the fetus and GSO is likely to attenuate this effect, despite the fact that glucose uptake was not evaluated in our study. On the other hand, it has been shown that trophoblast isolated from term placentas cultured at hyperglycemic medium resulted in a reduction in GLUT 1 protein expression (OSMOND et al., 2000). These results clearly show that several factors are involved in the regulation of glucose transfer to the fetus besides changes in GLUT activity, such as syncytiotrophoblast utilization of glucose by glycolysis and/or glycogen synthesis. Indeed, changes in glycolytic and NADP-generating enzymes have been reported in diabetes, highlighting the importance of more comprehensive studies on the effects of high glucose on placental function.", "It has been demonstrated that placenta from women with GDM treated with anti-diabetic drug presented increased expression of GLUT 1 and HK 2, both at mRNA and protein levels when compared to placentas from women with GDM treated only with a controlled diet and from uncomplicated pregnancies (MURALIMANOHARAN; MALOYAN; MYATT, 2016).", "These results clearly suggest that placental glucose metabolism is affected by high glucose", "concentration and that the more severe insulin resistance is, the more placental function is affected.", "Lactate accumulation in the culture medium is a result from its production, consumption and transport in and out the cell.

The ratio +GSO:GSO confirmed that 10 mM glucose significantly decreased LDHa expression in the presence of GSO (Figure 13A, white bars). LDHa expression profile at 10 and 20 mM glucose is consistent with the increase in lactate production in these conditions, shown in Figure 11. On the other hand, the decrease in its expression observed at 10 mM +GSO may not explain the significant increase in lactate production at this condition (Figure 11B). At 20 mM +GSO, however, there was a significant decrease in expression when compared to the 20 mM glucose, and this decrease might, in part, explain the decrease in lactate production in the presence of GSO at 20 mM glucose (Figure 11B).", "When evaluating the effects of high glucose and GSO on LDHb (Figure 13B), there was a decrease in its expression at 10 mM glucose +GSO when compared to 5 mM +GSO (Figure 13B, gray and white bars). The decrease in LDHb, might explain, in part, the increase in lactate production at 10 mM +GSO, decreasing the conversion of lactate to pyruvate. It is well stablished that anaerobic glycolysis is the placenta’s major ATP-synthesizing pathway since high glucose uptake and lactate production commonly observed in the human placenta from uncomplicated pregnancies. On the other hand, increased lactate production due to increased LDH gene expression and activity seem to be a common feature in placentas under different metabolic stress, as pre-eclampsia, due to hypoxia.

The two most common isoforms are", "MCT 1 and MCT 4. Noteworthily, the subcellular localization of MCT 1 and MCT 4 is differentiated on the maternal or fetal sides of the trophoblast. In the human placenta MCT 1 and MCT 4 are arranged respectively to the basal plasma and the apical plasma membrane facing the maternal blood (IWANAGA; KISHIMOTO, 2015).", "Very little is known about these lactate transporters in trophoblast cells but MCT 4 is thought to serve primarily in lactate extrusion. In hypoxia, MCT 1 gene expression was not affected, while MCT 4 expression was increased, along with its protein content (KAY; ZHU; TSOI, 2007). It has been demonstrated that the complete knockout for MCT 1 is embryonically lethal, possibly due to the deficient transfer of lactate via placental MCT 1. It is worth noting that MCTs display a broader distribution than glucose transporters, GLUTs, suggesting that lactate may be a more fundamental energy substrate than glucose to the fetus (IWANAGA; KISHIMOTO, 2015). Taken together, our results on MCT expression must be analyzed carefully since not only alterations in gene transcription might be involved in lactate transport in trophoblast cells but particularly its subcellular localization (IWANAGA; KISHIMOTO, 2015). Since BeWo cells are models of cytotrophoblasts, it was not possible to investigate the effects of glucose and GSO on the distribution of MCT in the present study.", "4.5 Grape seed oil increased linoleic acid incorporation on BeWo cell line membrane", "As GSO is a rich matrix of unsaturated fatty acids and high glucose affected nutrient metabolism, it is possible that both variables may alter lipid metabolism on cytotrophoblast, a poorly understood topic. Table 3 presents the fatty acids profile of human placenta cell line BeWo at the different glucose concentration tested and in the presence of GSO. On all conditions, saturated fatty acids were the most abundant (52.1 – 72.5%), followed by monounsaturated (24.5 – 35.6%) and polyunsaturated (14.2 – 19.3%). On all conditions, caprylic acid (8:0), capric acid (10:0), palmitic acid (16:0) and oleic acid (18:1 n-9 cis) were the major fatty acids, each corresponding to more than 10% of the total FA content. The highest polyunsaturated content and unsaturated/saturated (U/S) ratio were observed at 5 mM glucose +GSO. Major changes were observed on linoleic acid (18:2 n-6 cis) content, having around doubled on all GSO treated conditions when compared to the same glucose concentration without the oil.", "Table 3. Fatty acid content (%) on human placenta cell line BeWo at high glucose concentration with or without grape seed oil (GSO) incubation.", "5 mM 10 mM 20 mM 5 mM", "+GSO 10 mM +GSO 20 mM +GSO Saturated Fatty Acids", "Monounsaturated Fatty Acids", "Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids", "ND: Not detected . *it was not possible to distinguish the two FA through the GC method", "Linoleic acid (18:2 n-6 cis) is an essential fatty acid that must be derived from the diet as it cannot be synthetized by humans and can be metabolized to longer‐chain fatty acids by increasing the chain length and the degree of unsaturation. Linoleic acid can be metabolized to cis-8,11,14-eicosatrienoic (20:3 n-6) and cis-5,8,11,14-eicosatetraenoic (20:4 n-6; ARA), which can be particularly interesting for the cell metabolism.", "5. CONCLUDING REMARKS", "Grape seed oil has proved to be a very rich complex food matrix, with abundant unsaturated fatty acids content and antioxidant compounds. These beneficial components, however, may have different effects on several biological functions on human placenta BeWo cells when exposed to high glucose concentrations, as investigated and discussed at this study. The decrease in total cell number by incubation of BeWo cells with high glucose concentrations and with GSO, even though not associated with cell death, is particularly worrying as it could result on impaired invasion to the decidua, which is crucial to adequate human implantation and placentation. Observations in human subjects must be conducted in order to explore this issue.", "The slight alterations on some autophagy and ER stress related genes suggests that any activating or inhibition of these pathways related to the oil or high glucose may be subtle. GSO seemed to attenuate ATG-7 and LC3B increase induced by hyperglycemia, suggesting a protective effect of the oil for preventing an aberrant activation of autophagy, although further investigation needs to be conducted.", "Results lead to the speculation that NAMPT expression could be associated with the increased metabolic activity observed, due to its role on a variety of metabolic and stress responses. On the other hand, in the presence of GSO, the increase in NAMPT expression seem not to be related to the increase in metabolic activity.", "On mitochondrial dynamics, MFNs seem not to be involved in the decrease in BeWo proliferation promoted by glucose in the absence of GSO and other mechanisms might be involved. As mitochondria and the ER are interdependent organelles central to homeostasis, viability, and growth, functional assays are necessary to investigate mitochondrial respiratory activity and further address the effects of GSO and high glucose on BeWo cells. Lactate accumulation was assessed as an initial investigation on respiratory function. GSO at 20 mM may play a role on attenuating the toxic effect of glucose on BeWo cells, possibly preventing a metabolic acidosis that might be caused by non-controlled glycemia, a common feature of GMD. These results have possible clinical implications as they are correlated to previous studies and encourage further research in the search for food components or whole food that prevents placental alterations in GDM pregnancies. Importantly, the results suggest anaerobic glycolysis as a basic mechanism that can be relevant to the functional alterations induced by GDM, to the placenta and consequently to the fetus.", "It seems that other mechanisms rather than increased glucose uptake due to GLUT 1 activity and increased glucose phosphorylation, due to HK 1 activity, might be taking place to account for the increase in lactate accumulation after glucose incubation in the presence of GSO. Also, the results show that several factors are involved in the regulation of glucose transfer to the fetus besides changes in GLUT activity, such as syncytiotrophoblast utilization of glucose by glycolysis and/or glycogen synthesis. Indeed, changes in glycolytic and NADP-generating enzymes have been reported in diabetes, highlighting the importance of more comprehensive studies on the effects of high glucose on placental function.", "Taken together, our results on LDH and MCT expression must be analyzed carefully since not only alterations in gene transcription might be involved in lactate production and transport in trophoblast cells but particularly its subcellular localization.", "The characterization of total fatty acid composition of BeWo cells was initial and further investigation of lipid metabolism in the placenta is recommended. In respect to FA alterations, major changes were observed on unsaturated fatty acids, possibly influencing the metabolism of essential fatty acids on BeWo cells, which can act as cellular signalizers.", "All these effects are attributed to the whole oil composition, which contain in addition to fatty acids, high content of antioxidant compounds, instigating more research on whole food. Grape seed oil biological effects are still poorly explored on scientific literature and there are unlimited possibilities to be tested. This study has begun to elucidate some of these effect, although its main contribution still remains on the questions generated through the results. Many functional and mechanistic investigations may unfold from this research.", "All literature data indicates grape seed oil as a safe to eat vegetable oil with undoubtful dietary benefits, thus it is possible to be consumed on a dietary grade on a varied diet, with special care to balance on PUFAs ingestion. Its specific biological mechanisms addressing the role as a protective or stress factor are yet to be determined."]}

Apathy in AD is related to worse prognosis of the disease and is a predictive factor of increased mortality. Current literature has mostly contemplated apathy in AD as a unidimensional construct; studies exploring the prevalence, clinical and neuronal correlates of the behavioural, cognitive, and affe ctive dimensions are missing. The Apathy Evaluation Scale, AES, is a semi - structured interview widely used for dementia studies; nevertheless, the predictive validity of the AES was not investigated specifically among people with AD (PwAD).", "Moreover, lack of awareness about impairments is commonly found in PwAD; recent evidence suggests that patients may respond to the experience of illness despite limited awareness, but there is a lack of explorations whether this result in long -term behavioural adjustment s. Another relevant issue in the context of AD is the exploration of different aspects of the self, as the condition can impact differently on those . In order to address these questions, we conduct four studies. A systematic review exploring the dimensions of apathy in PwAD including 17 studies showed that behavioural apathy is the most prevalent , negatively affect ing decision -making. Then comes cognitive apathy, the second most prevalent, which is related to executive dysfunction. Affective apath y is less prevalent, being associated with reduced Theory of Mind (ToM abilities ) and physical agitation . In the second study, the predictive validity of the clinician -version of the AES for PwAD was investigated using success -failure manipulation tasks exploring emotional reactivity and persistence. Apathy presented no associations with self -reported emotional reactivity, but significant correlations with facial expressions, and motivation and enjoyment in memory tasks. Results highlight that the AES may measure more directly behavioural apathy. A further study explored whether implicit emotional responses to experiences of failure in cognitive tasks would result in long -term changes in behaviour, measured by task persistence, which was determined by relative time spent doing the tasks, considering that participants would be more likely to stop performing tasks in", "which they had experienced failure during the first session, one week before. Task persistence in the second session was not affected by performance in the first session. However, higher levels of awareness of performance in the first session led participants to stop performing tasks after a sequence of errors in the second session. In addition, considerin g the existence of a multiplicity of “selves,” the last review of this thesis suggested seven fundamental self -processes, which can be identified and might impact the experience of living with dementia. These include (1) an embodied self; (2) an agentic self; (3) an implicit self; (4) a critical self; (5) a surrogate self; (6) an extended self; and, finally, (7) an emergent self. The findings of this work emphasise that apathy, including its dimensions , is a very relevant syndrome in the co ntext of AD . The contributions of this thesis are potentially relevant for clinical practices and caregiving .", "KEYWORDS : Alzheimer's disease; dementia; awareness; implicit awareness; emotions; apathy; self", "SUMMARY ARTICLE 1 : Dimensions of Apathy in Alzheimer’s Disease: A Systematic ARTICLE 2: Preliminary Evidence for Predictive V alidity of the Apathy Evaluation ARTICLE 3: Implicit Behavioural Change in Response to Cognitive Tasks in Alzheimer", "BACKGROUND ALZHEIMER’S DISEASE Dementia is a broad term referring to several diseases, usually of a chronic or progressive nature, which affect cognitive and functional domains beyond what might be expected from the usual consequences of biological ageing, and leading to a variety of behavioural and psychological symptoms (WHO, 2018). Moreover, dementia is the leading cause of disability and dependency among older people (DUBOIS et al., 2010, MOGRABI e MORRIS, 2018). Assuming the existence of a worldwide population ageing phenomenon ( UN, 2015), dementia becomes a notable theme, as age represents its most significant risk factor (PIACERI et al., 2013, PRINCE et al., 2016). In accordance with the WHO, c urrently circa 55 million people are estimated to suffer from dementia in the world (WHO, 2021) and dementia numbers are projected to nearly double every 20 years (PRINCE et al., 2015; WHO, 2018) . In addition, 7 0% of those affected lived in low and middle income countries (WHO, 2021). Those estimations are associated with considerable costs for governments, families and individuals, leading to further loss in productivity for economies (PRINCE et al., 2016) . Considering the economic and social consequences of dementia, along with its contribution to d ependence and disability, it stands out as one of the public health priorities of the 21st century.", "Alzheimer disease (AD) is one of the most common forms of dementia among older adults, contributing to 60 -80% of all cases (ANAND, et al., 2014; BUCKNER et al., 2005; SALMON et al., 2005) . The main risk factors for AD are advancing age, positive family history, female gender , previous depression, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidaemia, vascular factors and head trauma (KIVIPELTO et al., 2005) . Although the scientific literature tends to relate the neurodegenerative process in AD with the accumulation of abnormally folded amyloid β and TAU protein in amyloid plaques and neuronal tangles, still little is known about the cause of the disease (SCHELTENS et al., Alzheimer’s disease has been shown to affect multiple aspects of cognition and behaviour (WEINTRAUB & WICKLUND, 2012) , being characterised by cognitive and non -cognitive symptoms related to cerebral atrophy (NELSON et al., 2012; SCHELTENS et al., 2016). Considering the diagnosis of AD, a set of criteria such as those enclo sed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM -5) (APA, 2013) are evaluated, including significant impairments in one or more cognitive domains: learning, memory, language, executive function, complex attention, perceptual -motor and social cognition. In addition, these deficits must include a significant impairment in social or occupational functioning and constitute a change from a previous level of", "performance (KNOPMAN et al., 2001; PETERSEN & MORRIS, 2005, APA, 2013) . The cognitive deficits should not be bett er explained by another mental disorder or in the context of a delirium. Further, AD is associated with a number of difficulties in self -reference (self -processing), involving difficulties in updating self -knowledge (FEINBERG, 2011; MORRIS & MOGRABI, 2013) . Additionally, recent research described that emotional domains might also be affected even before the manifestation of the cognitive symptoms (FREDERICKS et al., 2018).", "AD is characterised by neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) (DIETLIN et al., 2019; LYKETSOS, 2015; STEINBERG et al., 2008), which were associated with caregiver burden , early institutionalisation (LANCTÔT et al., 2017), worse prognosis of disease and death (PETERS et al., 2015). Apathy is described as the most frequent NPS in people with AD (PwAD) (MEGA et al., 1996; LYKETSOS, 2015; SIAFARIKAS et al., 2017; STARKSTEIN e t al., 2006; ZHAO et al., 2016), followed by depression, aggression, anxiety, and sleep disorders, among others (ZHAO et al., 2016). The presence of apathy was suggested to be the main cause of suffering in PwAD and the major reason for admission into an i nstitution (TUN et al., 2007; BEINOT et al., 2008). Additionally, apathetic patients were more susceptible for all NPS associated with AD (BEINOT et al., 2008). Furthermore, apathy has been pointed out as a predictive factor of increased mortality in AD pa tients (VILALTA - FRANCH et al., 2012; SPALLETTA et al., 2015). Thus, this syndrome can be taken as a significant issue for people with AD, as it represents a possible booster, which increases patient’s disabilities and is taken as an important source of str ess for caregivers and a substantial cause of increased health costs due to early institutionalisation (AGÜERA -ORTIZ1et al., 2016).", "APATHY IN ALZHEIMER’S DISEASE Apathy can be defined as a syndrome involving behavioural, cognitive and affective symptoms, including loss of initiative, lack of interest in executing goal -oriented activities and emotional blunting (MARIN et al. 1991; STUSS et al., 2000; LEVY & DUBOIS, 2006; MULIN et al., 2011). In a systematic review and meta -analyses performed by Zhao and colleagues (2016), including 25 articles between 1964 and 2014, authors described an apathy prevalence of 49% in AD. A large range of prevalence of apathy in people w ith AD was found, 19% to 88% between studies (ZHAO et al., 2016) . The heterogeneity across studies could be a result of different evaluation methods, duration of the disease (LANDES et al., 2001; ZHAO et al., 2016) and educational and cognitive level of pa tients (ZHAO et al., 2016). In spite of the well -established higher apathy prevalence in later stages of the disease (LANDES et al., 2005; STARKSTEIN et al., 2006), authors reported a significant prevalence even in mild to moderate stages (BEINOT et al., 2 008), tending to increase with disease progression", "(LANDES et al., 2001). Apathy in dementia is usually assessed through clinical interviews (e.g., Apathy Evaluation Scale, AES; MARIN et al., 1991), in the form of informant or self -report questionnaires (for a review of assessment methods see BOYLE & MALLOY, 2003).", "It is important to distinguish between apathy and depression in patients with dementia. Even though apathy and depression are often concomitant (STARKSTEIN et al., 2001) and characterised by disturbances in emotional exp erience, they can be considered as different clinical conditions that can occur independently (CEREJEIRA et al., 2012). Apathy is known as a motivational disorder, mainly defined by lack of emotional reactivity and loss of initiative and participation in goal-directed behaviours, cognitive activities and emotional processing (MARIN, 1990; ROBERT et al., 2009). Apathy is conceptualised as a three -part construct (i.e., cognitive, behavioural and affective). The first one involves cognitive dysfunction reflect ed by a compromised plan of actions aiming to anticipate behaviour, while the second dimension encompasses inability to generate external behaviours and encloses difficulties in the voluntary activation of thoughts and self -initiation of actions. Lastly, t he third construct involves compromised emotional processing for combining affective and emotional inputs in the anticipation of behaviour (MARIN, 1991; LEVY AND DUBOIS, 2006). Apathy is commonly described as an independent syndrome, since no secondary factor (e.g., emotional distress, diminished level of consciousness or cognitive impairment) may lead to the peculiar loss of motivation observed in patients (LEVY & DUBOIS, 2006; MARIN et al., 1991). Although lack of motivation can occur in both apathy and d epression (MULIN et al., 2011), apathy is marked by lack of motivation without alternations of mood states or dysphoria (CEREJEIRA et al., 2012). Further evidence from neuroimaging studies supports the distinctions between apathy and depression in people w ith AD, suggesting that the neurobiological correlates of apathy are independent from those involved in depression (see RAIMO et al., 2019). Previous literature on AD has extensively correlated apathy with decreased grey matter volume in several cortical a nd subcortical areas, particularly the medial frontal, lateral orbitofrontal and ventrolateral prefrontal cortices, basal ganglia, as well as the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) (APOSTOLOVA et al., 2007; BRUEN et al., 2008; ROSEN et al., 2005; TUNNARD et a l., 2011).", "Although a number of studies have been produced aiming to better understand apathy in the context of AD, there is still a lack of information concerning how the different dimensions of apathy manifest in PwAD. Furthermore, the predictive validi ty, which represents in this case the extent to which the score of a scale predicts the value of behavioural variables in the future and was considered one of the most import aspects of a scale validation (CUNNINGHAM, 1986, MARIN et al., 1991), of widely used instruments to assess apathy in PwAD is still missing. That is the case, for example, for the Apathy Evaluation Scale (AES, MARIN et al., 1991), a widely used scale in dementia studies", "(BOYLE & MALLOY, 2003), that had its predictive validity tested for healthy adults, but not exclusively for PwDA.", "THE SELF AND DEMENTIA Despite the lack of a consistent definition, the idea of the self is very important for the comprehension of our daily experiences and the experience of living with a psychiatric or neurological disorder, as we assume a first -person perspective to access t he world events in our everyday life. William James suggested that for the existence of feelings and thoughts an experiencer is essential, otherwise there would be no experience (JAMES, 1950), a phenomenon known as first -person ontology (SEARLE, 2007). The self, in this context, is understood as an inherent property that modulates our subjective perspective in the apprehension of our world.", "Some authors have pointed a range of neuropsychological disorders involving the self (Also called neuropathologies of the self (FEINBERG, 2011) ), which are characterised by states in which patients present dysfunctions in their personal identity or personal relat ionships between the external world and the self (FEINBERG, 2011) . In this context, each self -process, when affected, might compromise different a spects. For example, self -processes related to external sources of information might negatively impact the manner individuals interact with objects and persons and can lead to alterations on the significance of the self in relation to the external world (F EINBERG, 2011). Examples of such pathologies that can alter the self are dementia, autism, schizophrenia and delusional misidentification syndrome. These pathologies can affect different domains of the self, as for example, dysfunctions reflected by a los s of sense of the nature or limits of a person’s own body, or alterations in how subjects describe present and past circumstances (FEINBERG, 2011) . Such alterations in self -experience caused by neurological and psychiatric conditions constitute further evidence for the construct of a miltifaceted self, as the differences between those alterations in the experience of the self might reflect a possib le divergence in neuronal pathways underpinning this phenomenon. Following this view, this work refers to the self as ¨self -processes¨ or ¨aspects of the self¨, avoiding the interpretation of the self as something that exists inside our mind; i.e., to thin k about the self as a particular function attributed to some specific region of our brain. Hence, the experience of the self can be understood as an interaction of processes, representing different aspects of the self, which involves distinct networks of t he brain exchanging information with the environment and are under influence of interpersonal values and cultural factors (MOGRABI et al., 2009). Moreover, this multiplicity of self -processes might establish a hierarchical relationship, as it", "has been sugg ested that higher order self -processes rely on information produced by more essential ones (FEINBERG et al., 2005).", "In the context of AD, exploring self -processes is very relevant, as dementia can impact each of them differently. Indeed, AD is a neurodegen erative condition, in which patients, already in early stages, suffer from cognitive decline, such as memory impairment (WEINTRAUB & WICKLUND, 2012; NELSON et al., 2012; SCHELTENS et al., 2016; PRINCE et al., 2016). Considering the relationship between sel f and memory from the perspective of memory alterations and reduced ability to update self-knowledge , PwAD, as already described, are limited to outdated information to frame their sense of self. Another example highlighting the impact of dementia on the e xperience of the self in PwAD is related to implicit mechanisms of awareness, which are modulating emotional reactivity and behaviour in patients even in the absence of explicit awareness, promoting actualization of self - knowledge. Following this line of t hinking, accumulating evidence in literature supports the idea of the existence of several self -processes in PwAD. Understanding which aspects of the self might be preserved among different stages of disease and which are more vulnerable is essential in or der to provide adequate care to patients and their family. Such knowledge also supports the use of more humanised care practices involving conservation of preserved aspects of the self and reinforcement of those which are impaired.", "ANOSOGNOSIA IN ALZHEIM ER’S DISEASE The concept of self -awareness can be described as the ability of becoming the object of one’s own awareness (MORIN, 2011) and is a crucial aspect that allows individuals to properly function in everyday life by recognizing limits and accurate ly choosing activities in accordance with their abilities (ROSEN et al., 2010). Self -awareness can be explicitly expressed as self -reports, or in a more implicit way, through behaviour. There is a hierarchy involving self -awareness that incorporates differ ent kinds of emotional and cognitive processes, as sensory and perceptual stimuli, but also higher cognitive functions. Complex levels of self -awareness involve the ability to permanently and precisely monitor performance or events (MORRIS & HANNESDOTTIR, 2004) . One aspect, which is fundamental to self -awareness is metacognition, which refers to the appraisal of thoughts, emotional feelings, and perceptual representations (MOGRABI et al., 2021). In the context of neurological diseases, anosognosia is the term used to name lack of awareness of having a disorder or di sability (MOGRABI & MORRIS, 2018). Anosognosia manifests in different levels, ranging from complete lack of awareness of the condition, where patients deny the presence of a specific disorder, to milder forms. In mild forms, patients present difficulties i n recognizing", "alterations in specific domains, including cognitive, sensory, motor and behavioural dysfunctions, as well as incapacities in social abilities and everyday functioning, but also personality changes (JACUS, 2017; MOGRABI et al., 2018). Awarene ss in people with dementia (PwD) is often assessed by contrasting patients’ self -report with clinician/caregiver reports; nevertheless, quantitative measures can be used to access awareness by being compared to self -report, for example, current performance in tasks compared to evaluative judgments of performance (CLARE et al., 2005). Anosognosia is one of the core features of AD and can be considered a consequence of disease progression (HANNESDOTTIR & MORRIS, 2007) . There is a large variation in prevalence estimations of this phenomenon across studies (rangi ng from 23 to 81%) (MOGRABI et al., 2012c; SOUSA et al., 2015) . Nevertheless, studies with large samples consistently reported a prevalence above 30% in PwD (STARKSTEIN et al., 2 007), as for example the epidemiological study of Mograbi et al. (2012c), including 897 PwD, which showed that 78% of patients were unaware of their mnemonic impairments.", "Anosognosia has important implications for patients and caregivers, as for examp le, reduced treatment compliance (PATEL & PRINCE, 2001; STARKSTEIN et al., 2007) has a role in patients’ safety, as its presence is related to their exposure to risk situations, such as driving (HURT et al., 2010, PATEL & PRINCE, 2001; STARKSTEIN et al., 2 007) and is also associated with earlier institutionalisation (HORNING et al., 2014). In addition, anosognosia was also described to contribute to caregiver burden (SELTZER et al., 1997).", "In the context of AD, a large range of mechanisms has already been a ssociated with the presence of anosognosia; examples of those are: monitoring and control processing failure (SOUC HAY, 2007) , emotional dysregulation effects associated with self -monitoring, impaired ability for consolidation of new personal information and reduced decision -making capacity (MORRIS & MOGRABI, 2013) . Additionally, literature suggests that anosognosia in AD may be caused by a decline in specific aspects of memory, leading to a reduction in the ability to update self -knowledge due to lack of actualization of performance and self -ability through personal trait judgement (MOGRABI et al., Following the Cognitive Awareness Model (CAM, AGNEW & MORRIS, 1998 ; MORRIS & HANNESDOTTIR, 2004; MORRIS & MOGRABI, 2013), lack of awareness is considered a heterogeneous phenomenon, including more structural damage, leading to an executive form of anosognosia and mnemonic forms of anosognosia. In the context of AD, the a nosognosia is mostly related to memory impairments, i.e., mnemonic anosognosia. Considering the CAM model, information is consolidated and updated into a storage for personal information (i.e., Personal Data", "Base). Normally, this data base is continuously updated following experience, as impairments in current abilities are detected and compared with stored information by a Cognitive Comparator Mechanism. If there is divergence between information stored in the personal data base and current performance a M etacognitive Awareness System releases the information. This provides material for the consolidation of updated self -knowledge, developing for example a sense of awareness of failure. In this model, anosognosia is seen as multifactorial dysfunction. The C AM is a framework based on the hypothesis that anosognosia in AD is mostly a consequence of loss of mnemonic ability, specially the consolidation of episodic autobiographical memory, which encompasses knowledge about oneself, including memories of signific ant personal events and experiences (CONWAY, 2005) . In this context, there is impairment in actualization of experi ence related to self -ability, reflecting in difficulties to update self -knowledge, thus, leading to a Personal Data Bank filled with outdated information in PwAD (MOGRABI et al., 2009; MOGRABI & MORRIS, 2013; LENZONI et al., 2020). Another postulation of t he model is related to executive impairments causing anosognosia, leading to the so -called executive anosognosia. This kind of anosognosia is linked to dysfunctions in the Cognitive Comparator Mechanism, which functions under executive control and detects current performance by comparing them with stored personal information. Such deficits impact the capacity of actualization of knowledge linked to functional alterations related to condition (MORRIS & MOGRABI , 2013).", "NPS were also shown to be related to reduced awareness (VOGEL et al., 2006), especially apathy (DEROUESNE et al., 1999). Some studies have explored associations between levels of awareness and apathy in PwAD, as apathy has been consistently linked to anoso gnosia in literature. Authors associate increased anosognosia to higher levels of apathy (e.g., DEROUESNE et al., 1999, STARKSTEIN et al., 2001), but also the presence of anosognosia as a predictor for apathy at later stages of disease (STARKSTEIN et al., 2001). Moreover, supportive of this assumption, a common neuroanatomical correlate has been suggested for apathy and anosognosia (OTT et al., 1996) in AD. Neuroimaging studies indicate that both are related to frontal lobe dysfunctions (MARIN, 1991; MARSHA LL et al., 2006; MARSHALL et al., 2007; LANCTÔT et al., 2017; APOSTOLOVA et al., 2007 ). Converging evidence from neuroimaging studies indicate that anosognosia is also linked to frontal lobe dysfunction (AMANZIO et al., 2011; HARWOOD et al., 2005). In additio n, Raimo et al. (2019), in a meta -analysis, highlighted that apathy might be a consequence of dysfunctions in regions involved in executive -cognitive processing (i.e., frontal areas) and emotional regulation (e.g., cingulate areas and reward system). Accor dingly, anosognosia in AD was linked to neuropsychological tests of executive functions (MANGONE et al., 1991; MICHON et al., 1994). A", "more detailed investigation of the association between apathy and anosognosia is crucial for a better understanding of ho w these phenomena might be related.", "IMPLICIT AWARENESS IN ALZHEIMER’S DISEASE There is a substantial body of clinical and experimental evidence that shows that our behaviour and emotions are affected by implicit information processing and that this phenomenon is preserved in a variety of neurological conditions (for a review, see MO GRABI AND MORRIS, 2013). People with dementia commonly lack awareness about their illness, cognitive impairments, or reduced neuropsychological performance (MOGRABI et al, 2012a; ROSEN, 2011; STARKSTEIN et al, 2007). Weinstein (1991) suggested that even th ough people with AD may lack explicit awareness, they do adjust their behaviour and activities in accordance with the necessities resulting from current condition and impairments related to it (WEINSTEIN, 1991). Mograbi and Morris (2013) reported based on clinical observations that unawareness paradoxically can be accompanied by signs of understanding or representation of deficit, which are not explicitly expressed. In this context, implicit awareness may promote a kind of implicit emotional and behavioural adjustment to the neuropsychological deficits without conscious retrieval of information, reflecting the existence of implicit knowledge in people with dementia. A number of studies have explored implicit awareness regulation in behaviour and emotional re sponse in PwAD (see for detail MOGRABI & MORRIS, 2013). Cotrell and Wild (1999), for example, elucidated that PwAD may implement voluntary and self-initiated restrictions, which are not necessarily linked to their cognitive deficits, on driving habits, in response to their impairments. In addition, Drachman & Swearer (1933) suggested that PwAD adapt their behaviour towards driving habits through implicit responses linked to failure situations, giving preference to driving fewer miles and restricting driving to familiar environments. Another example of such adjustments is the effect of emotional interference on behaviour, which operates at an automatic and non -conscious processing level (MOGG et al., 1993; OHMAN et al., 2001). This has been observed in terms of emotional reactivity to memory -related words in an experiment using an adapted Stroop test (Martyr et al, 2011). In this study, researchers aimed to determine whether people in early -stage dementia and carers show a processing bias to dementia - related words in an emotional Stroop paradigm. Authors reported that both people with dementia and carers showed the same level of increase in response time to salient words, compared to neutral ones. Additionally, in patients this effect was unrelated to their ex plicit levels of awareness of the condition, indicating an implicit level emotional interference modulating behaviour (MARTYR et al., 2011).", "A study exploring emotional reactivity to film material gives further evidence for implicit emotional processing in PwAD. Patients were exposed to a set of material promoting different stimuli including neutral, negative, and positive materials. Negative material was related to features of dementia or a person dealing with cancer. Although, in general, AD patients pres ented slightly decreased self - reported emotional reactivity to negative films in comparison to health controls, they presented a similar pattern of facial expressions in response to all films (MOGRABI et al., 2012b). This idea was also explored experimenta lly in a study (MOGRABI et al, 2012a) that investigated emotional reactivity in response to performance using computerised memory or reaction time tasks in which difficulty levels were manipulated for success and failure conditions. The hypothesis explored was that, if there is implicit awareness of failure, the emotional response should be relatively preserved. Results indicated that, although AD groups had less explicit awareness of failure relative to controls, emotional reactivity was preserved, both in terms of self -report and filmed facial expressions, with increased reactivity to failure compared to success. These results emphasise the existence of implicit awareness expressed by a congruent emotional reactivity to task failure experience. The implici t processing of information occurred even when patients were explicitly unaware of their actual task performance.", "Moreover, implicit awareness is not only regulating current behaviour, it may also be capable of promoting increases in explicit awareness. This data is consistent with the CAM (AGNEW & MORRIS, 1998; MORRIS & HANNESDOTTIR, 2004; MORRIS & MOGRABI, 2013). As the model postulates that the presence of relatively well -preserved mechanisms for error detection allows information about deficits or con ditions to be undertaken by a parallel implicit route that bypasses consciousness, resulting in emotional and behavioural regulation in the absence of metacognition (MOGRABI et al., 2009). In summary, implicit forms of knowledge are able to regulate curren t emotional reactivity and behaviour, and might be linked to gains of explicit awareness. These are very interesting features; nevertheless, there are still open questions about the role of implicit awareness in promoting long lasting behavioural changes i n PwAD.", "OBJECTIVES In line with the presented theoretical background, this work aims to explore different aspects of apathy, implicit awareness and self -processes in PwAD.

This review explores behavioural, cognitive, and affective dimensions of apathy in AD. A systematic search of original studies on the theme was conducted using the PubMed database. After meeting the eligibility criteria and being assessed for quality, a total of 17 studies were included. Results suggest that behavioural apathy is the mos t prevalent dimension in AD, negatively affecting decision -making and being correlated to reduced grey matter volume in the frontal pole and hypoperfusion in the right ACC. Cognitive apathy is related to executive dysfunction and disruptions in the dorsola teral-prefrontal circuit. Affective apathy is less prevalent, being associated with reduced ToM abilities, physical agitation and alterations in left frontal regions and reduced grey matter volume in the left insula, amygdala and cerebellum. People with AD present reduced awareness of apathetic symptoms for all dimensions. Dimensions of apathy manifest differently in AD, and exploring these distinct features may assist developing personalized care and therapeutic interventions for apathy.", "KEYWORDS : Alzheim er’s Disease; apathy dimensions; cognitive apathy, affective apathy and behavioural apathy.", "INTRODUCTION Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia worldwide, contributing to 60 –70% of cases, according to the World Health Organization (WHO, 2017). In addition to the initial memory decline and cognitive deficits, AD is characterized by neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS; Dietlin et al., 2019; Lyketsos, 2015; Steinberg et al., 2008), with apathy being one of the most prevalent (M ega et al., 1996; Lyketsos, 2015; Siafarikas et al., 2017; Starkstein et al., 2006; Zhao et al., 2016). Apathy can be defined as a syndrome involving behavioural, cognitive and affective symptoms, including loss of initiative, lack of interest in executing goal-oriented activities and emotional blunting (Marin et al. 1991; Stuss et al., 2000; Levy & Dubois, 2006; Mulin et al., 2011). Although apathy and depression are often concomitant (Starkstein et al., 2001), they are considered different clinical condit ions and can occur independently (Cerejeira et al., 2012). Even though there is an overlap of symptoms between both conditions, apathetic patients do not present, typically, mood state alternations (e.g., guilt, hopelessness, or sadness (Starkstein et al., 2005; Benoit et al., 2012) or dysphoria (Cerejeira et al., 2012). Therefore, apathy is commonly described as an independent syndrome, in which no secondary factors (e.g., emotional distress, physical or cognitive impairment) could lead to the characterist ic loss of motivation observed in patients (Marin et al., 1991; Levy & Dubois, 2006). Additionally, apathy is believed to be more related to declines in intrinsic motivation and, more specifically, goal -directed behaviours ( Marin & Wilkosz, 2005; Levy & Du bois, 2006 ). Apathy is suggested to be one of the leading causes of suffering in people with AD (PwAD) and the primary reason for admission into an institution (Tun et al., 2007; Benoit et al., 2008). Moreover, apathetic PwAD are more susceptible to develo p other NPS (Benoit et al., 2008), as well as deficits in cognition and everyday life abilities, correlated with higher levels of caregiver's stress (Boyle & Malloy, 2003; Landes et al., 2005; Starkstein et al., 2006; Benoit et al., 2008; Lou et al., 2015) , and increased health costs due to early institutionalization (Agüera -Ortiz1et al., 2016). Associations between apathy symptoms and lack of self -awareness have also been reported (for a review, Mograbi & Morris, 2014). Furthermore, apathy has been indicat ed as a predictor of increased mortality in PwAD (Vilalta -Franch et al., 2012; Spalletta et al., 2015). Imaging studies have consistently associated apathy with frontal lobe dysfunction (Marin, 1991). Previous literature on AD has extensively correlated gl obal apathy syndrome with decreased grey matter volume in several cortical and subcortical areas, particularly the medial frontal, lateral orbitofrontal, and ventrolateral prefrontal cortices, basal ganglia, as well as the anterior cingulated cortex (ACC) (Apostolova et al., 2007; Bruen et al., 2008; Rosen et al., 2005; Tunnard et al., 2011).", "Apathy can be divided into three dimensions (behavioural, cognitive and affective), characterized by distinct symptoms . Behavioural apathy can be defined as a deficit in generating goal -directed behaviours, involving an inability to self -activate thoughts (Levy & Dubois, 2006) and initiation and engagement processes (Lanctôt et al., 2017). Some authors believe that this kind of apathy might affect patients' ability to generate externally driven behaviour (Levy & Dubois, 2006) and, indeed, it has been described as the most severe form of apathy (Levy & Dubois, 2006). Cognitive apathy is behaviourally expressed through the inability to create and conclude both plans of ac tion and goal - oriented behaviours (Robert et al., 2008; Perri et al., 2018), as well as significant deficits in direct interest and attentional processes (Lanctôt et al., 2017). Finally, affective apathy is related to the lack of ability to link emotional information with current behaviours, leading to affective flattening or emotional blunting (Levy & Dubois, 2006; Lanctôt et al., 2017), loss of will, and emotional distance (Perri et al., 2018).", "Although extensive literature has been written aiming to characterize apathy in PwAD and the consequences of this syndrome in patients’ and caregivers’ lives, most studies assess it as a unidimensional concept, and do not measure the distinct dimensions of this syndrome (Levenson et al., 2014). A few studies explored the distinct apathy dimensions in AD, but these data have not been summarized concerning prevalence, clinical associations and neural correlates. Increasing interest in distinguishing and inves tigating all three dimensions of apathy is justified by the fact that this syndrome is potential treatment target among AD (Lanctôt et al., 2017), with each dimension benefitting from different kinds of therapies (Robert et al., 2010). Considering this, th e current review aims to evaluate and summarize the research on the different dimensions of apathy involved in AD, based on the division proposed by Robert et al. (2010) that separates apathy into three dimensions: behavioural, cognitive and emotional apat hy. The following specific research questions were addressed: ‘How do the three dimensions of apathy manifest in PwAD?’, ‘Which neuropsychological, behavioural and emotional aspects were already related to each distinct apathy dimension in PwAD?’, and ‘Do the different apathy dimensions have shared neural correlates?’", "METHODS Search strategy Reviewed articles were selected according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta -Analyses (PRISMA; Page et al., 2021 ) guidelines. Each apathy dimension was systematically searched for on the PubMed database, considering articles published until 26th", "November 2021.

The Apathy Evaluation Scale (AES) is an 18 -item scale based on self -,", "informant - or clinician -report, being the most frequently used instrument for assessing apathy across domains (Marin et al. 1991; Yeh et al. 2018). The Apathy Inventory (IA) consists of a global assessment of apathy syndrome with specific measures for its domains (Robert et al., 2002). The Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) is a structured interview designed to measure the frequency and the severity of apathy through primary screening questions that are followed up by more detailed ones in case symptoms are endorsed (Cummings et al., 1994). The Lille Apathy Rating Scale (LARS) is a 33 -item patient and informant interview, originally developed to identify and quantify apathy in patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD) (Sockeel et al., 2006), and later validated for mild to moderate dementia (Fernández -Matarrubia et al., 2015). The Apathy in Dementia Nursing Home Scale (APADEM -NH), used by Ag üera-Ortiz et al. (2015), was the first instrument specifically designed for apathy assessment among institutionalized patients with neurodegenerative dementia (Sockeel et al., 2006). The Dimensional Apathy Scale (DAS) is a quantitative method used to assess multidimensional apathy in dementia patients throu gh specific subscales (Radakovic et al., 2017), comprising both self and informant - versions. Lastly, The Apathy Diary (ApD) consists of a guide specifically devised for caregivers to report qualitative day -to-day aspects of AD patients’ behaviour (Perri et al., 2018).

Based on caregivers and caregiver -patient ratio IA scores, Robert et al. (2002) reported both higher global and behavioural apathy scores among patients when compared to healthy older adults. Similar findings were described in studies using another multidimensional apathy scale, the DAS. Prevalence of global apathy and its three dimensions were greater in AD patients than in control subjects, with behavioural apathy rates being higher for both patient - and caregiver -ratings (Radakovic et al., 2017). Additionally, one study described behavioural apathy as the second most prevalent dimension in AD, behind cognit ive apathy , with 84% of PwAD exhibiting initiation symptoms (loss of self -initiated behaviour) and 63% responsiveness symptoms (loss of environment -stimulated behaviour; Mulin et al., 2011).", "Clinical associations", "In relation to depression, behavioural apathy subscale and total apathy scores, measured by both the IA caregiver and patients’ ratings, correlated with NPI depression scores. A caregiver -patient ratio score presented no correlations between depression and any of the apathy dimensions (Robert et al., 2002). Additionally, AD patients showed reduced awareness of apathetic behavioural symptoms when measuring discrepancies between patient - and caregiver -ratings (Robert et al., 2002; Radakovic et al., 2017). Among mild to moderate AD patients, Perri et al. (2018) used a self -created Apathy Diary (ApD ) based on apathy symptoms to assess the relationship between cognitive aspects of executive functions, theory of mind ( ToM ) and behavioural measures. Indeed, behavi oural apathy scores were predicted by the performance in both executive function (Modified Card Sorting Test (MCST) and ToM assessments (Emotional Attribution Tasks). Considering early stages of AD, Esposito et al. (2010) used the IA to explore the relatio nship between apathy and multitasking (Modified Six Elements Task (MSET). Patients and control subjects presented statistically significant differences in MSET task performance, with AD patients exhibiting fewer trials in subtasks and more rule breaks. Behavioural apathy presented significant positive correlations with the number of rule breaks, while affective and cognitive apathy showed no significant correlations. Regression analysis indicated that rule breaks and depression, assessed by the HADS (i.e., Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale), were the best predictors of behavioural apathy in PwAD . Based on these findings, the authors concluded that behavioural apathy could have a strong association with decision -making processes and with intrinsic and external motivation involved in goal -directed behaviour, both necessary for a satisfactory perfor mance in multitasking sets (Esposito et al., 2010). Behavioural apathy was associated with caregiver burden in a predictive model chosen by a regression analyses even after taking into account patient variables, including diagnosis of AD or FTD (Kumfor et al., 2018).", "Amnestic MCI and AD diagnoses were also positively correlated with action initiation difficulties (i.e., behavioural apathy) and the total LARS apathy score when compared to control subjects (covariates as age and educational level include d). Between -groups comparisons point out a significant negative effect of behavioural apathy as this", "dimension was related to reduced decision -making ability, measured by the Iowa gambling task (IGT) (Bayard et al., 2014). Finally, the CDR score (Clinical Dementia Rating Scale) revealed a high correlation between severe dementia and severe apathy, both in terms of total AES and behavioural apathy (Yeh et al., 2018).", "Neural correlates Benoit et al. (2004) conducted a single photon emission tomography (SPE CT) study to analyse brain perfusion among AD patients. Lack of initiative (behavioural apathy), assessed by the IA, was negatively correlated with perfusion in the right ACC . A negative correlation was also demonstrated between the three apathy domains an d brain perfusion in the left and right superior orbitofrontal gyrus, and to a lesser extent in left middle frontal gyrus (Benoit et al., 2004). Likewise, Robert et al. (2006) demonstrated through SPECT that, when controlling for affective apathy and NPI d epression scores, lack of initiative was highly associated with the right frontal and the right inferior temporal lobes, with significant lower perfusion in the right ACC . The maximum correlation between behavioural and cognitive apathy dimensions was obse rved within the right frontal lobe and the right inferior temporal lobe (Robert et al., 2006).", "Stanton et al. (2013) demonstrated in a voxel -based morphometry (VBM) analysis that behavioural apathy in AD patients (52.9% with apathy) was highly associated with reduced grey matter volume in the medial frontal gyrus, especially in ACC and ventrolateral orbitofrontal cortex. An increased grey matter volume in the right lingual gyrus and left cuneus was also described.", "Regarding frontal neurochemical metabolit es measured by proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), Yeh et al. (2018) reported a lower N -acetylaspartate/creatine ratio (a marker of neuronal heath and a substrate and product of creatine kinase, respectively) in the ACC of AD patients presenting behavioural apathy.", "In order to compare the multidimensional aspects of apathy across distinct dementias, Kumfor et al. (2018) conducted a study with AD and bvFTD patients, in which 60% and 85%, respectively, displayed apathy symptoms. Structured MRI and VBM analysis", "showed that behavioural apathy was highly associated with lower grey matter intensity in the frontal pole and in subcortical regions, specifically the basal ganglia and nucleus accumbens , together with the right precentral gyrus and cerebellum. This study also suggested that this apathy dimension would appear relatively low in mild -moderate stages of the disease ( Kumfor et al., 2018).", "An inclusive MRI and VBM analysis correlated the co -occurrence of the tree apathy dimensions with red uced grey matter integrity in a frontoinsular network, including unilaterally the left insula, inferior frontal gyrus, putamen and frontal operculum cortex and bilaterally the frontal poles (Wei et al., 2019). On the other hand, in initiation apathy, describing both behavioural and cognitive apathy domains, AD -Early patients were associated with a decreased grey matter intensity in the right medial prefrontal cortex, left frontal pole, orbitofrontal cortex, the right paracingulate, and the ACC (Wei et al., 2019).", "Cognitive apathy dimension Prevalence The prevalence of cognitive apathy among PwAD varies across studies. Indeed, some authors describe it as the most prevalent dimension (e.g., Mulin et al., 2011), while others assume it to be behavioural apat hy (Robert et al., 2002; Radakovic et al., 2020). Using the NPI, Mulin et al. (2011) described the cognitive dimension as the most affected in AD, considering the frequency of both intrinsic and external motivation for goal -direct behaviour (89% and 77% ra tio distribution, respectively ). Additionally, Robert et al. (2002) stated that caregiver ratings showed significant differences for the IA total and cognitive apathy scores between patients and controls. Using DAS for both patients - and caregivers -ratings , Radakovic et al. (2017) reported that patients exhibited greater behavioural apathy symptoms and notable rates for cognitive apathy (Radakovic et al., 2017). In a further study, the same group reported a ratio of 50% presenting cognitive apathy (Radakovi c et al., 2020).", "Studies on apathy profile in AD, bvFTD and PPA, assessed through DAS, reported no observed differences in cognitive dimension between them (Radakovic et al., 2020). Moreover, Wei et al. (2019) showed greater effect of dementia progression on cognitive", "symp toms during the course of AD compared to FTD, even though patients in later AD stages still presented fewer cognitive apathetic symptoms when compared to FTD later stages. Additionally, the authors found that cognitive apathy increased in early AD stages in comparison to the time before symptoms onset (Wei et al., 2019).", "Clinical associations Regarding disease progression, a time effect on cognitive apathetic symptoms was reported on later AD stages compared to prior disease onset (Wei et al., 2019). Com plementary, severe dementia ( CDR score) positive correlated with cognitive apathy severity (Yeh et al., 2018). Nevertheless, no correlation was found between cognitive apathy and clinical variables (cognitive status, functional independence and depression) in different disease stages (Radakovic et al., 2017). Even though the caregiver -patient ratio score did not show significant differences among AD and PD for cognitive apathy scores, both groups differed significantly on their awareness level for this di mension. IA subscale for cognitive apathetic symptoms in AD patient -rating was less impaired than the caregiver -rating, which was not the case within PD patients (Robert et al., 2002). The same discrepancies on awareness between AD patient - and caregiver -ratings were observed by Radakovic et al. and colleagues (2017), using the DAS (Radakovic et al., 2017). Regarding depression scores, the IA cognitive apathy subscale for caregivers and patients' ratings were correlated to the NPI depression subscale, while no correlation was found for patient -caregiver's ratio scores (Robert et al., Moreover, Perri et al. (2018) neuropsychological investigation reported that among patients with mild to moderate AD, Modified Card Sorting Test performance, an executive function assessment, was the best predictor of cognitive apathy symptoms. Thus, among PwAD , this dimension has been suggested to be probably related to executive dysfunction. No correlations between cognitive apathy and functional independence, global cognitive functioning or behaviour changes were found in AD (Radakovic et al., 2020). Age and educational level might be related to a higher cognitive", "apathy prevalence, as shown t hrough a positive correlation with LARS intellectual curiosity subscale in AD patients (Bayard et al., 2014).", "Neural correlates In Benoit et al. (2004), single photon emission tomography images associated lack of interest (cognitive apathy) with hypoperf usion in the right (and, to a lesser extent, left) middle orbitofrontal gyrus. IA cognitive dimension score was positively correlated with the other apathy domains, as well as with NPI depression score (Benoit et al., 2004). In addition, Kumfor et al. (2018) comparison between AD and bvFTD reported that the cognitive dimension was associated with lower grey matter intensity in the left orbitofrontal and subcallosal regions, extending into the medial prefrontal cortex, ACC and superior frontal gyrus, as well as the inferior temporal gyrus and posterior cingulate cortex. Due to the extensive overlap between cognitive and affective apathy correlates, an exclusive structural MRI and VBM masking analysis was performed, particularly associating the cognitive d omain with more dorsal PFC regions, including the paracingulate gyrus, bilateral frontal operculum cortex and superior frontal gyrus (Kumfor et al., 2018). Similarly, an inclusive MRI and VBM analysis correlated initiation apathy (i.e. behavioural and cogn itive apathy domains) in AD -Early patients with a decrease in grey matter intensity in the right medial prefrontal cortex, left frontal pole, orbitofrontal cortex, the right paracingulate, and the ACC (Wei et al., 2019). Robert et al. (2006) controlled AD patient -ratings for affective apathy and NPI depression score and found that lack of interest (cognitive apathy) was also highly associated with the right frontal and the right inferior temporal lobes, with a significant lower perfusion in the right ACC (R obert et al., 2006).", "Cognitive apathy in AD was associated with a lower N -acetylaspartate/creatine ratio in the ACC measured using proton MRS (Yeh et al., 2018). Additionally, through a fluid - attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) image approach, Ag üera-Ortiz et al. (2016) reported a significant correlation between deficit of thinking, which refers to diminished goal-directed cognition and ischemic damage (white matter hyperintensities) in the right periventricular frontal region (Ag üera-Ortiz et al., 201 6).", "Affective apathy dimension Prevalence Affective apathy is less often manifested in AD patients compared to the cognitive and behavioural dimensions, according to the majority of the studies included in this review. Mulin et al. (2011), through the NPI, reported affective apathy to be the least prevalent in patients, with lower rates for intrinsic and external goal -direct behaviour symptoms (66% and 52% respectively), compared to other dimensions (Mulin et al., 2011). Nevertheless, consid ering IA caregiver -patient ratio, greater affective apathy scores were found among AD patients compared to healthy older adults (Robert et al., 2002). Investigations on apathy profiles among AD and bvFTD patients described affective apathy, assessed by th e NPI, to be less prevalent in PwAD . Patients with AD showed less affective apathy compared to FTD patients (25% and 75% of the sample, respectively) (Radakovic et al., 2020). In a multivariate regression model, this was the only dimension capable of disti nguishing both dementia groups, as it predicted bvFTD (Quaranta et al., 2012) and was less recurrent in early -stage AD than in early -stage bvFTD . Nevertheless, significant increases in affective apathy could be observed with AD progression to moderate stat es, a pattern not observed among bvFTD patients (Wei et al., 2019). The distinct apathy profiles observed between AD, bvFTD and PPA patients were also distinguished through the DAS.", "Clinical associations Based on the discrepancy between patient - and caregiver -ratings, AD patients presented reduced awareness of affective apathetic symptoms (Robert et al., 2002). Radakovic et al. (2017) reported similar results regarding reduced awareness for affective apathy in AD (Radakovic et al., 2017). Additionally , when compared to FTD patients, AD patients presented significant higher levels of lack of awareness for emotional apathy (Fernández - Matarrubia et al., 2017; Radakovic et al., 2020). No significant correlations were found between DAS affective apathy scores and cognitive status, functional independence and depression (Radakovic et al., 2017).", "Regarding depression, the NPI subscale was positively correlated with IA caregiver - ratings for affective apathy, although the patient’s assessment and patient -caregiver’s ratio score were not (Robert et al., 2002). Using the AES, the affective dimension and higher depression scores, measured by the CSDD scores, were also positively associated (Yeh et al., 2018). No correlations were found between affective apathetic symptoms, measured by DAS, and functional independence, global cognitive functioning and behaviour changes (Radakovic et al., 2020). Nevertheless, affective apathy severity highly correl ated with dementia severity (CDR score) (Yeh et al., 2018). Still, considering neuropsychological correlates, a link between ToM and affective apathy in AD was highlighted by Perri et al. (2018). Regression analysis showed that a ToM assessment (Emotiona l Attribution Task) was able to predict the affective apathy symptoms described in the ApD (Perri et al., 2018). Regarding decision -making abilities assessed through IGT, no correlations were found for affective apathy measured by the LARS (Bayard et al., 2014).", "Results of a regression analyses validated a model to predict carer burden and reported that the level of affective apathy significantly predicted carer burden, even after taking into account patient variables, including diagnosis (i.e. in this cas e AD and FTD) (Kumfor et al., 2018).", "Adiotionally, Fernández -Matarrubia et al. (2017) used the LARS and the apathy subtest of the NPI and showed that PwAD presented less “Blunting of emotional responses” than bvFTD assessed by the LARS, corresponding to reduced impairment in emotional apathy in AD (Fernández -Matarrubia et al., 2017). Similarly, Chow et al. (2009) reported different prevalence in apathy syndrome among PwAD and FTD. An analysis based on NPI affective apathy subscores allocated both dementia populations in ¨patients with affective apathy¨ and ¨patients with nonaffective apathy, and ¨non -apathetic patients¨ different groups, and further explored their relation between apathy and other NPI items. The presence of affective apathy (36% of all apathetic participants), when compared to nonaffective apathy and non -apathetic subj ects, was related to agitation, anger, insensitive behaviour, compulsions and impulsivity. Specifically, AD patients with affective apathy exhibited higher levels of physical agitation compared to those with nonaffective apathy (Chow et al.,2009).", "Neural correlates In the study by Benoit et al. (2004) affective apathy was significantly correlated with hypoperfusion in the left superior frontal gyrus. IA emotional blunting scores were also positively associated with the other apathy domains, as well as wi th NPI depression score (Benoit et al., 2004). Stanton et al. (2013), in a VBM analysis, showed an association between affective apathy and reduced grey matter volume in the left insula and the left parahippocampal gyrus. An increased grey matter volume in the cerebellum, right middle occipital gyrus and left cuneus was also reported among both AD and PSP patients (Stanton et al., 2013). Wei et al. (2019) concluded that in the early stage of the disease (< 5 years since onset), emotional apathy was greater within bvFTD patients in relation to AD. In both types of dementia, affective apathy was significantly associated with decreased grey matter intensity in the cerebellum bilaterally, the left amygdala, as well as more posterior regions, including th e right postcentral gyrus, supramarginal gyrus, the left inferior frontal gyrus, and the central opercular cortex. Likewise, Kumfor et al. (2018) found an association between affective apathy and lower grey matter intensity in the left temporal poles, exte nding into the bilateral orbitofrontal cortex, subcallosal cortex and bilateral insula. An exclusive structural MRI VBM masking analysis between affective and cognitive domains finally correlated affective apathy with ventral PFC regions, including the bil ateral frontal medial cortex, ACC and left frontal pole (Kumfor et al., 2018).", "Affective apathy was associated with frontal neurochemical metabolites changes in AD patients, reflected by a lower N -acetylaspartate/creatine ratio in the ACC of AD patient s, assessed with proton MRS (Yeh et al., 2018). Through a comparative analysis between emotional blunting related damage and deficit of thinking related damage among PwAD , Agüera-Ortiz et al. (2016) described affective apathy damage to be more correlated with anterior brain regions. Tract damage in a smaller and more anteriorly located region of the right internal capsule and corpus callosum was associated with a higher emotional blunting subscore (Agüera-Ortiz et al., 2016).", "DISCUSSION This review systematically searched and summarised current information on behavioural, cognitive and affective apathy dimensions in AD. Seventeen articles making use of different apathy multidimensional instruments were included in the review. Results highlighted a higher prevalence of apathy symptoms in PwAD when compared to control subjects, especially for behavioural apathy, followed by cognitive and affective dimensions. Comparisons with other dementia types suggested that PwAD presented preserved affec tive apathy, while behavioural and cognitive apathy were not so precise in distinguishing between conditions. All apathy dimensions seem to be more involved with internally motivated goal -directed behaviour impairments. Considering the clinical association s of the distinct apathy dimensions, PwAD presented reduced awareness of symptoms involved in all dimensions. Behavioural apathy can negatively affect decision - making, while cognitive apathy was linked to executive dysfunctions, and affective apathy to poorer ToM abilities and high levels of physical agitation . All apathy dimensions were associated with depression in PwAD . Considering neural correlates, behavioural apathy was associated with reduced grey matter volume in the frontal pole and hypoperfusio n in the right ACC, cognitive apathy with disruptions in the dorsolateral - prefrontal circuit, and affective apathy with impairments in left frontal regions, reduced grey matter volume in the left insula and amygdala and bilateral cerebellum. Several clini cal instruments are currently used to assess apathy frequency and severity, yet, they diverge in the extent to which they evaluate the full range of its symptoms, sometimes focusing exclusively on behavioural, cognitive or affective aspects (Chase, 2011; M ohammad et al., 2018; Landes et al., 2001). Still, a critical analysis of the parameters used to distinguish between the different apathy domains enabled a proper comparison between results in this review . Noteworthy, a standardization of the distinct apathy domains among instruments, together with a consensus of the characteristic symptoms manifested by each of them, would facilitate researchers increase knowledge and summarise data on apathy.", "One of the aims of this review was to explore how apathy dime nsions’ manifest in PwAD. In general, patients presented higher prevalence of apathy when compared to healthy older adults. Predominantly, behavioural apathy was reported as the most prevalent", "apathy dimension in AD, followed by cognitive and affective apa thy. This pattern is similar among amnestic MCI and additionally described as a risk factor for the conversion to AD (Robert et al., 2002; Robert et al., 2006a ). Even though, considering the source of motivation for goal -directed behaviour, apathy dimensio ns had differed on the ratio of intrinsic and external motivation; they are all more represented by symptoms related to the intrinsic initiation of goal -directed behaviour than externally stimulated ones (Mulin et al., 2011). Indeed, apathy has been previo usly related to lack of motivation (Marin et al., 1991; Robert et al., 2002; Levy & Dubois, 2006), with intrinsic motivation being described as more affected than extrinsic in AD apathetic patients (Levy & Dubois, 2006). Besides, such motivational deficits might affect apathy dimensions differently (Robert et al., 2002); as an example, anticipatory pleasure and sensitivity to reward could influence all dimensions but, still, would differ in their source of stimuli within each one (Raffard Considering the differences in apathy profile between dementia types, PwAD seem s to be less affected regarding affective apathy than FTD and PPA patients (Radakovic et al., 2020). This is in line with Quaranta et al. (2012), who described affective apathy as the only dimension capable of distinguishing both dementia groups, as it predicted bv FTD (Quaranta et al., 2012), and Wei et al. (2019), who reports higher levels of affective apathy in early bvFTD compared to early AD (Wei et al., 2019).", "Another aim of t his work was to investigate the clinical and neuronal correlates of each distinct apathy dimension. Two studies explored how different AD patients and their caregivers evaluated the presence of apathy and its dimensions, providing information about patient s’ levels of awareness of their apathetic symptoms (Robert et al., 2002; Radakovic et al., 2017). Despite the disparities between patients’ scores among studies, both described reduced levels of awareness for all three dimension s. These findings are in lin e with previous reports on diminished awareness of apathy symptoms in AD (Starkstein et al., 2001; Aalten et al., 2006; Spalletta et al., 2012). Noteworthy, the level of awareness for apathy appears to be relatively more preserved than awareness for overal l condition and executive functions (Bertrand et al., 2019). The most affected dimension by lack of awareness was behavioural apathy, which might be explained by patients’ difficulty remembering behavioural changes that occurred since the beginning", "of the disease (Robert et al., 2002). On the other hand, apathy is related to emotional blunting and, thus, might lead to normalization of errors (Mograbi & Morris, 2014). The absence or diminution of error signals may lead to a lack of awareness, as it can under mine proper judgments of performance (Rosen, 2011 ).", "Perri et al. (2018) suggested that apathetic behavioural symptoms might reflect the sum of emotional and cognitive processing deficits (Perri et al., 2018) . This theory is in line with other studies on apathy (Levy & Dubois , 2006; Esposito et al., 2010). Imaging studies included in this review suppo rt such idea, as behavioural apathy in AD was highly associated with hypoperfusion and a reduced grey matter volume in frontal brain regions, especially in the ACC (Benoit et al., 2004; Robert et al., 2006; Stanton et al., 2013; Wei et al., 2019), which is a brain region described as a fundamental connector between the \"emotional\" limbic system and the \"cognitive\" prefrontal cortex (Stevens et al., 2011) and enables motivation guidance and decision -making, regardless of the task and the effort needed (Klein -Flügge et al., 2016; Scholl et al., 2015). Some authors defend that even if behavioural apathy depends on similar variables as cognitive and affective apathy, the source and variety of those may differ and differently influence each dimension (Raffard The association between ACC function and apathy syndrome is not limited to the behavioural dimension, as even to a lesser extent, this region was also negatively correlated to both cognitive and affective dimensions in AD (Robert et al., 2006; Yeh et al., 2018; Kumfor et al., 2018). Similarly, Yeh et al. (2018) described a lower NAA/Cr ratio in the ACC within all dimensions, supporting the idea of decay in local neuronal integrity in AD apathetic patients.", "Furthermore, cognitive apathy was assoc iated with executive dysfunction in AD, specific related to programming, abstraction, strategy generation, set -shifting and working memory (Perri et al., 2018). These results are in line with the neuronal correlates of apathy described in this review, as t his dimension was related to the dorsal PFC (Kumfor et al., 2018), which is functionally associated with executive functions (Alexander & Crutcher, 1990; Alexander et al., 1991). Cognitive apathy was also related to hypoperfusion in the orbitofrontal corte x (Benoit et al., 2004), a region associated with control and", "organisation of behaviour, and linked to goal direct behaviour (Rolls., 2004; Kringelbach., 2005).", "Affective apathy was predicted by ToM abilities in AD patients using an emotional blunting tas k (Perri et al., 2018), which is in accordance with the fact that emotional blunting is one of the most characteristic symptoms of affective apathy ((Levy & Dubois, 2006; Lanctôt et al., 2017)), besides loss of will and emotional distance (Perri et al., 20 18). Additionally, the affective domain was associated with left -frontal brain regions, as impairments in patients' left superior frontal gyrus (Benoit et al., 2004), bilateral frontal cortex (Kumfor et al., 2018) were reported. Those regions have been ass ociated with the experience of strong emotions and the involvement of those in motivation to execute goal - directed behaviours (Adolphs, 2009), but also with emotional blunting when disrupted (Rosen et al., 2002; Boone et al., 2003). Indeed, Fernández -Matar rubia et al. (2017) discuss ed that early alterations showed in VBM analysis over FDG -PET scan images in these brain regions, could be lead ing to the greater impairment of emotional dimension in bvF TD patients in comparison to AD, highlighting the role of t hese regions in “Blunting of emotional responses ¨ (assessed by the LARS) (Fernández -Matarrubia et al., Affective apathy was also highly associated with lower grey matter intensity in the insula (Stanton et al., 2013; Kumfor et al., 2018), a less es tablished correlation in literature. Yet, as this region is involved in emotional processing (Murphy et al., 2003) and in integrating sensory and salient interoceptive signals with motivational state and emotional experience (Craig, 2002), this finding sho uld be highlighted. In Wei et al. (2019), affective apathy was particularly correlated with decreased grey matter intensity in the cerebellum bilaterally and the left amygdala. Accordingly, recent neuroimaging studies suggest an important role of the cereb ellum, especially the vermis, in emotion perception and regulation (Bermpohl et al., 2006; Baumann and Mattingley, 2012; Pierce and Péron, 2020), as well as in inferring the emotional state of others and awareness of subjective feelings (Clausi et al., 201 9b; Strata, 2015). Indeed, the cerebellar relevance in emotion processing is sustained by connections with the proper limbic system, as the medial prefrontal cortex and the amygdala (Baumann and Mattingley, 2012; Pierce and Péron,", "Moreover, PwAD presenting affective apathy demonstrated higher levels of physical agitation compared to those without this apathy dimension (Chow et al., 2009). In a previous study in older adults, Raffard and colleagues (2016) indeed correlated, among other variables, phys ical function with affective apathy (Raffard et al., 2016). Fact that might be explained by the regions associated to physical agitation and affective apathy in PwAD , which are very similar, e.g. PFC, cingulate cortex, insula, amygdala (Trzepacz et Additionally, a relationship between depression and apathy in AD was reported ( Robert et al., 2002; Radakovic et al., 2017) . It has been shown that depression can lead to difficulties in executing goal -directed activities involving c ognitive control (Harvey et al., 2005) and loss of interest and pleasure (American Psychiatric Association, 1994), which are common characteristics of apathy. Therefore, these correlations can be a consequence of symptoms overlapping between depression and apathy. Another fact is that depression was mostly assessed by the NPI, a widely used tool, but it assesses depression as a symptom and does not diagnose the syndrome. Here, it is important to highlight that apathy can be observed as a clinical symptom in depression, but it can also occur in patients who are not depressed. Besides that, even if a neurological patient develops both conditions, they may differ anatomically and clinically (Levy & Dubois, Finally, the presence of apathy might negatively influence the clinical outcome of AD patients. Therefore, the bidirectional character of the relation between apathy and such variables has to be investigated not only as a consequence, but also as a possible risk factor for the development of apathy in p atients with amnestic AD (Bayard et al., 2014). The current study has a few relevant limitations. Firstly, we decided not to perform a meta -analysis. Nevertheless, this was done due to methodological heterogeneity in the studies reviewed. Secondly, restric ting the scope to AD has limited the number of eligible articles. However, this was done to more readily summarize the data, increasing the homogeneity of participants, and also considering that AD is the most common form of dementia.", "In conclusion, these findings emphasize how differently behavioural, cognitive and affective apathy impact on AD patients, both on clinical and neuronal level. Individual", "features of each dimension should be employed in assessment protocols used for the diseases’ diagnosis and evaluation. This could elucidate and distinguish the different patterns in which apathy syndrome can develop in dementia patients and, in turn, guide further studies on the subject.", "Future research on the particular aspects among the dimensions could lead to substantial insights (e.g. motivating patients thought emotions instead of cognitive commands) into daily care of the apathetic AD patients, increasing their life quality and diminishing caregiver's stress. Furthermore, the comprehension of the distinc t development pattern of each apathy dimension and its specific effects regarding clinical symptomatology and neural impairments could properly guide the improvement of both therapeutic and pharmacological interventions. Finally, multidimensional apathy as sessments may help tailoring treatment to individual patient needs.", "AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS IB, IN, SL, and DM contributed writing and revising the manuscript.

Apathy in AD is related to worse prognosis of disease and is a predictive factor for increased mortality. The Apathy Evaluation Scale (AES) is a semi -structured interview widely used in dementia studies. Although this instrument was not designed as a ger iatric scale, its validity and reliability have been replicated for people with dementia. Nevertheless, no predictive validity was investigated specifically for people with AD. The current study aims to investigate the predictive validity of the AES for pe ople with AD (PwAD). Twenty -three PwAD took part in two studies using success -failure manipulation tasks exploring emotional reactivity and persistence, with results being correlated with the clinician -version of the AES. Apathy presented no associations w ith self -reported emotional reactivity, but significant correlations with facial expressions, and motivation and enjoyment in memory tasks. Results highlight that the AES may measure more directly behavioural apathy.", "KEYWORDS : Apathy, emotional reac tivity, behavioural validation, predictive validity, dementia.", "INTRODUCTION Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia, being characterized not only by cognitive deficits, but also neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS). In particular, apathy has been indicated as the most persistent and frequent NPS in AD (Lyketsos, 2015), with prevalence ranging from 19% to 88% (Zhao et al., 2016) . Other estimates of prevalence vary between 25% and 50% (for review, Starkstein, Jorge, & Mizrahi, 2006) , but this may reflect the variety of assessment methods and differences in dementia severity across groups. Prevalence tends to be lower for self -ratings of apathy (Clarke et al., 2007) and higher for severe than mild dementia (Starkstein, Ingram, Garau, & Mizrahi, 2005) , worsening with disease progression (Starkstein, Jorge, Mizrahi, & Robinson, 2006) . Additionally, apathy has been associated with faster cognitive and functional decline (Starkstein et al., 2006) and may be a predictive factor of increased mortality (Vilalta -Franch, Calvó -Perxas, Garre -Olmo, Turró -Garriga, & López -Pousa, 2012). Furthermore, there is an overlap between the presence of apathy and depression in people with dementia (Robert et al., 2009) . For example, Starkstein and colleagues (2001) reported a prevalence of apathy in AD of 37%, with 24% of patients presenting bo th apathy and depression.", "Even though apathy and depression are often concomitant (Starkstein et al., 2001) and characterized by disturbances in emotional experience, they can be considered as different clinical conditions that may occur independently (Cerejeira et al., 2012) . Apathy is known as a motivational disorder, mainly defined by lack of emotional reactivity and, loss of initiative and participation in goal directed behaviours, cognitive activities and emotional processing (Marin, 1990; Robert et a l., 2009) . Apathy is conceptualized as a three -part construct (i.e., cognitive, behavioural and affective). The first one involves cognitive dysfunction reflected by compromised planning of actions. The second dimension encompasses inability to generate ex ternal behaviours and self -initiation of actions. The third construct involves compromised emotional processing and affective blunting (Marin, 1991 ; Levy and Dubois, 2006) . Apathy is commonly described as an independent syndrome, with no secondary factors (e.g., as emotional distress, diminished level of consciousness or cognitive impairment) leading to the peculiar loss of motivation observed in patients (Levy & Dubois, 2006; Marin et al., 1991) . Although lack of", "motivation can occur in both apathy and dep ression (Mulin et al., 2011) , apathy is marked by lack of motivation without mood swings or dysphoria (Cerejeira et al., 2012) . Further evidence from neuroimaging studies supports the distinction between apathy and depression in people with AD, suggesting that neurobiological correlates of apathy are independent from those involved in depression (see Raimo, Santangelo, D’Iorio, Trojano, & Grossi, 2018). Scales used to assess and distinguish both syndromes should also be able to differentiate their behaviour al outcomes (Mulin et al., 2011), which highlights the importance of investigating the predictive validity of instruments developed to measure these syndromes.", "Apathy in dementia is usually assessed through clinical interviews (e.g. Apathy Evaluation Scal e, AES; Marin et al., 1991) , informant (e.g. Frontal Systems Behaviour Scale; Grace & Malloy, 2011) or self -report questionnaires (e.g. self -rating versions of the above instruments; for a review of assessment methods, Boyle & Malloy, 2003) . The AES -clinician is a semi -structured interview assessing the participant’s interests and daily activities (an o verview of the clinical utility and psychometric properties of the AES can be found in Lee et al., 2020). Although the AES was not designed as a geriatric scale, it has been widely used in dementia studies (Boyle & Malloy, 2003) , and its validity and reliability (Clarke et al., 2007; Marin et al., 1991) have been replicated with people with dementia (Clarke et al., 2007) . Even though the AES represent an important instrument in assessing apathy i n people with Alzheimer’s disease (PwAD), there is still no predictive validity study of this scale with this clinical group specifically. In the study by Marin and colleagues (1991), although a behavioural validation was sought, participants recruited for med a heterogenous group, including subjects meeting criteria for right or left hemisphere stroke, probable Alzheimer’s disease, major depression and healthy older adults. In this study subjects were observed while playing with toys and video games in diff erent naturalistic settings, and assessed in terms of number of toys used, difficulty level chosen for the video games and time spent playing with both. Informant and clinician apathy ratings showed significant correlations with several of the outcome meas ures. Nevertheless, the study had a number of important limitations. In addition to the diverse sample, difficulty levels were pre -determined, with no individual adjustments for personal ability, and no intention to induce or explore", "affective states assoc iated with the experience of failure in tasks. Additionally, there was no direct or indirect measure of emotional reactivity, in terms of self -reported affective states or analysis of behaviour.", "Considering that predictive validity of an instrument might b e the most import aspect of its validation (Cunningham, 1986; Marin et al., 1991), and given the gaps identified above in the literature, the main aim of the current study is to provide exploratory evidence on the predictive validity of the AES in PwAD . For this purpose, a secondary analysis was conducted on data from two previous studies, in which PwAD had to do computerised reaction and working memory tasks with controlled levels of difficulty, indicating their level of motivation and enjoyment of the tas ks, as well as their emotional reactions, the latter being measured not only by self -report, but also through recording of facial expressions of emotions.", "METHODS Participants Twenty -three participants, aged 65 years or more, with mild to moderate AD were included. Participants were recruited either from the South London and Maudsley / Institute of Psychiatry Biomedical Research Centre (BRC) Dementia Case Register or from the St George's Healthcare NHS Trust (London) Dementia clinic. Diagnosis was made using DSM -IV criteria for Dementia of the Alzheimer’s type (American Psychiatric Association, 2000). Participants had Mini -Mental State Examination (MMSE; Folstein et al., 1975) scores of 18 or above (Mungas, 1991; NICE, 2006). Participants who fulfilled the study eligibility criteria were approached consecutively. Exclusion criteria were: presence of other neurological disorder (including cases of mixed or vascular dementia); history of head injury resulting in loss of consciousness for more than an hour ; history of alcohol or substance abuse (based on ICD -10 criteria); and history of diagnosed major psychiatric illness or current comorbidity.", "Instruments Participants were screened for cognitive and memory impairments. For a general measure of cognitiv e level, the MMSE was used (Folstein et al., 1975). The total score ranges from 0 to 30, with lower scores indicating impaired cognition. In addition, the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer’s Disease (CERAD, Morris et al., 1989 ) word list test were used. Scores for immediate recall, delayed recall, recognition and number of intrusions were generated.", "Apath y was assessed with the clinician version of the Apathy Evaluation Scale (AES; Marin et al., 1991), a semi -structured interview that relies on 18 -items with a 1 -4 Likert system. Scores vary from 18 -72 with higher scores indicating more severe apathy. In t he case of PwAD, informants were confirming answers. Although apathy was used in the analysis as a continuous variable, for descriptive purposes a cut -off ≥ 41 for apathy was established based on Clarke and colleagues (Clarke et al., 2007). For depression the selected scale was the clinician version of the Conell Scale for Depression in Dementia (CSDD; Alexopoulos et al., 1988), a 19 -item instrument, which encloses information from patients and caregivers. Scores ranges from 0 to 38 with higher scores indic ating greater severity of depression. Although depression was used as a continuous variable in the analysis, a cut -off ≥ 6 for depression was established based on current literature to characterise the sample (Korner et al., 2006).", "Procedures Overview Two different study protocols, using a success -failure manipulation computerized paradigm, were followed. Main results for these studies have been published previously (Mograbi et al., 2012; Bomilcar et al., 2018), and here the focus is on the rel ationship with apathy, which has not been reported. In both studies, self -report of emotions and behavioural emotional responses through facial expressions were assessed and correlated with AES ratings. The testing paradigms are described to provide conte xt to the reader.", "First study The first study consisted in exploring the capacity of PwAD of emotionally responding to the experience of failure (i.e., through self -reported emotions and facial expression reactivity). This study was part of an investigatio n of awareness of performance and emotional reactivity in the absence of explicit awareness in people with AD; for details see Mograbi el al., 2012a. In order to induce emotional states two success –failure manipulation comput erised paradigms were developed .", "Success -failure manipulation Participants performed reaction time (stopping a car or a falling object) and memory tasks (visual and verbal span). Two versions were created for each task, made distinctive by non-essential features. For each cognitive modality participants did a failure and a success task; assignment of task to condition was counter -balanced.", "All tasks included the same phases, i.e., practice trials, titration phase, initial success and the experimental phase. Practice trials occurred before the actual tasks, set at low difficulty levels, to familiarise participants to the tasks. The tasks then would start with a titration phase, in which participants’ performance threshold was established for each task by increasing the levels of difficult until consecutive failures occurred. This was followed by a short period of initial success, to create a more natural feeling to the task. Finally, in the experimental phase 90% of the trials would be either above or below the participants’ ability levels, depending on the experimental condition (failure or success).", "Measures In the first study two different measurements were conducted. Self -reported emotions were measured in form of overall reactivity. A self -report questionnaire was used wh ere four pair of emotions were assessed: frustrated/satisfied, disappointed/pleased, embarrassed/good about yourself, bored/energetic. This pairs of emotions were combined to form four dimension scores (i.e. frustration, disappointment, embarrassment and boredom). All four dimensional measures were summed in a single outcome measuring", "overall reactivity, with positive affect being reverse -coded. Scores of overall reactivity ranged from 0 -8 and higher scores indicated more negative affect. In addition, fa cial expressions were filmed and rated using the Facial Action Coding System (FACS, Ekman and Friesen, 1978) (see Mograbi et al, 2012a, for more details). Participants’ facial expressions were recorded continued throughout the tasks but analysed while they were doing the tasks for five random selected trials in each success/failure phase; trials lasted an average of approximately 3 s for the reaction time tasks and 20 s for the memory tasks. The coding was carried out by two certified FACS coders with 100h of training. Intra -rater reliability was established by rating 10% of the material 3 months later by the first rater, producing 91.3% agreement (kappa coefficient = .89; Cohen, 1960). Since the first rater was not blind to group membership, to explore the validity and reliability of the data, inter -rater reliability was assessed by an equally trained external coder, blind to the experiment purpose, group membership and stimulus type, rating 15% of the material, with 83.1% agreement (kappa coefficient = .80) .", "Second study The second study investigated persistence and motivation to complete the tasks. This was done by: (1) collecting self -reported measures of enjoyment and motivation in relation to the tasks in the first session; (2) repeating the tasks one week after the first session, to explore implicit avoidance and persistence. For the latter, during the second session, all tasks had an average level of difficulty (50%) and ran continuously, with participants indicating when to stop them. Considering the memory impairment of participants, they were prompted with the instructions and the information they could stop the task at any point every 4 minutes.", "Measures To rate motivation and enjoyment to do each computer task in the first session a four - point scale was used, with points labelled as follows: 0, “not at all”; 1, “a little”; 2, “somewhat”; 3, “a lot”. Both were assessed immediately after the practice trials but before starting the titration, to assure that participants were already familiarized with the task", "demands. The participants were asked: “How motivated are you to do this task, from not at all to a lot?” and “How do you think you will enjoy doing this task, from not at all to a lot?” Further explanation was given if needed. The questions w ere repeated immediately after the task, changing the phrasing slightly (e.g. “if you had to this task again, how motivated would you be?”). Participants’ motivation and enjoyment were also rated by the experimenter immediately following the self -rating pr ocedure. This complementary rating considered other details such as tone of voice, speed of response and facial expression of patients, summed to the verbal response.", "In the second session, persistence w as measured by how long participants did each task during the second session. In this experiment, the computer tasks had no time limit and patients were instructed that they could stop the task whenever they wanted. The time was recorded from the end of titration to when the patients stopped the task.", "Statistical analysis Descriptive statistics were generated to illustrate sample characteristics. To explore the behavioural validity of the AES, Pearson’s correlations were calculated between apathy and emotional reactivity and motivation variables. In Study 1, for each task this was done with change scores (after -before) of self -reported emotion and intensity and repertoire of facial expressions. In Study 2, correlations were calculated in the first session with overall enjoyment and motiv ation for each task type (memory or RT), and in the second session with time taken doing each task. Considering the exploratory nature of the current analysis, there was no correction for multiple testing, with α = .05. In the interpretation of results, fo cus was given to effect sizes (strength of the correlation).", "Ethical i ssues The project was approved by the South London and Maudsley/ Institute of Psychiatry Ethics Committee (Research Ethics Committee number 08/H0807/6). All participants provided infor med consent.

The majority of PwAD presented apat hy. In study 1, correlations between apathy and emotional reactivity in the form of self -report change score were not significant. For most tasks, however, moderate effect sizes were found with significant negative correlations between apathy, intensity an d repertoire of facial expressions. In study 2, apathy showed significant correlations with moderate to high effect sizes for motivation and enjoyment of memory tasks, but this was not the case for reaction time tasks, and no significant association was fo und for persistence in a second session.", "A large range of prevalence of apathy among studies investigating PwAD can be observed, ranging from 19% to 88% between studies (Zhao et al., 2016). The heterogeneity across studies could be a result of different e valuation methods, duration of the disease (Landes et al., 2001; Zhao et al., 2016) and educational and cognitive level of PwAD (Zhao et al., 2016). In our sample, a total of 56% of AD patients was above the cut-off score for apathy. Considering that the c urrent study investigated people with mild to moderate AD, this prevalence is in accordance with existing literature. Apathy was described to affect 42% of mildly cognitively impaired PwAD, 80% of moderately cognitively impaired and 92% of severely cogniti vely impaired ( Landes et al., 2001; Mega et al., 1996).", "The results of study 1 indicate that apathy negatively impacts emotional reactivity in PwAD. For the self -reported change score, correlations were not significant, but a medium effect size indicating less change after the memory success task was observed. In contrast, correlations for all tasks, except the memory success paradigm, were significant and presented moderate effect sizes for intensity and repertoire of facial expressions. These results may indicate that the AES assess more directly behavioural apathy compared to cognitive and affective apathy. One alternative explanation is that the intensity and repertoire of facial expressions represent a more direct measure to assess emotions in PwAD com pared to self -report.", "However, in the case of the current study, this explanation might not account for the finding of study 2 that pointed out negative apathy correlations with self -reported", "motivation and enjoyment in patients. These results are in line with the first explanation, which relies on the assumption that the AES score reflects behavioural apathy more compared to the two other dimensions. In addition, associations between apathy and self - reported motivation and enjoyment were present for memory tasks but not for reaction time. These findings are suggestive of a different impact of apathy depending on the personal relevance of the type of task the participant is involved in. PwAD are constantly confronted with memory failure situations. Supportin g this notion, a study from Martyr and colleagues (2011) highlighted, using an adapted emotional Stroop, that dementia - related words lead to a processing bias in PwAD, reflected by slower answers to dementia -related in comparison to neutral words.", "Results regarding the discriminant validity reported, as expected, no significant correlations with depression and effect sizes were small. It is worth distinguishing between apathy and depression, syndromes that can be comorbid in PwAD (Starkstein et al., 2001) b ut are considered different clinical conditions (Cerejeira et al., 2012). In essence, apathy in AD may present itself as a motivational disorder characterized by loss of initiative and participation in goal -directed activities and lack of emotional reactiv ity (Marin, 1990; Robert et al., 2009) and to be considered an independent syndrome, such loss of motivation should not be a consequence of a secondary factor such as emotional distress or intellectual impairment (Marin et al., 1991, Levy & Dubois, 2006). Some general limitations of the present work should be acknowledged. The small sample size, and restriction to mild to moderate AD, only allowed exploratory findings, so care must be taken with the extrapolation of results. Furthermore, it was not possible to distinguish between apathy dimensions. Future studies should investigate further the predictive validity of multidimensional apathy instruments in PwAD across severity ranges, exploring different behavioural outcomes for each apathy dimension. In brie f, the present study indicates that apathy as measured by the AES in PwAD presented associations with blunted emotional reactivity in terms of facial expressions and reduced motivation/enjoyment for memory tasks. These results have important implications, as they can be applied within clinical and research contexts to better understand the impact that apathy has on treatment, wellbeing, and the burden for PwAD and their families. Future research is needed to explore other variables that have not been consid ered here, as for example the relationship between apathy and cognitive", "impairment, functional capacity and anosognosia, which are of particular relevance for people with dementia. Additionally, further studies could investigate the correlations of such va riables, in addition to emotional processing, with the three apathy dimensions (i.e., cognitive, behavioural and emotional) separately.", "ACKNOWLEDGMENT The authors acknowledge support from the CAPES and FAPERJ foundation, the NIHR Biomedical Research Cent re for Mental Health at the South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust (SLaM) and Institute of Psychiatry, King’s College London.", "CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT The authors declare no conflict of interest.

In this study, we explored whether implicit emotional responses to experiences of failure in cognitive tasks would result in longer -term change in behavior. Methods: Twenty -two pa tients with AD were seen 1 week after a previous session in which they performed computer tasks that had been manipulated to be either too difficult (failure condition) or very easy (success condition) for them. At the second session, both types of tasks w ere set to have medium difficulty and were administered so that the participants decided how long to persist on each task. Task persistence was determined by relative time spent doing the tasks, considering that participants would be more likely to stop pe rforming tasks in which they had experienced failure during the first session. Results: Task persistence in the second session was not affected by performance in the first session. However, when participants’ awareness of performance in the first session w as taken into account, differences were found in persistence between tasks in the second session. During the second session, participants stopped performing tasks after a sequence of errors. There were no self -reported changes in motivation or enjoyment in response to task failure. Conclusions: These findings suggest that implicit learning of task valence may be compromised in AD, but that initial moments of awareness of performance may influence long -term adaptation in unaware patients.", "KEYWORDS : Alzheim er disease, dementia, anosognosia, implicit awareness, awareness.", "INTRODUCTION People with Alzheimer disease (AD) commonly lack awareness about their illness, cognitive impairments, or reduced neuropsychological performance (Mograbi et al, 2012b; Rosen, 2011; Starkstein et al, 2007). The term anosognosia, originally coined by Babinsk i (1914) to describe impaired self -awareness resulting from damage to brain structures, is an appropriate label for these phenomena in AD. The most obvious cause of this deficit in AD is neurobiological, but other factors, such as psychosocial influences like premorbid personality and social context, may also play a role (Clare, 2004). Even though people with AD may lack explicit awareness of their condition, recent studies have shown that they are capable of responding to the experience of illness. This ha s been observed in terms of emotional reactivity to memoryrelated words in a Stroop paradigm (Martyr et al, 2011) and normal emotional reaction to task failure (Mograbi et al, 2012a). Similar findings were reported in anosognosia for hemiplegia (Fotopoulou et al, 2010; Nardone et al, 2007) and psychosis (Beck et al, 2004). Such phenomena constitute what has been termed implicit awareness (see Mograbi and Morris, 2013). The concept of implicit awareness suggests behavioral adaptation to illness despite unawa reness of deficits, something that has been found in clinical observations (Mograbi and Morris, 2013; Orfei et al, 2007). For example, patients with hemiplegia may avoid activities that rely on use of both hands despite being anosognosic about their paraly sis (Bisiach and Geminiani, 1991; Cocchini et al, 2018). They may also refuse to acknowledge problems, despite complying with treatment, for example, by remaining in the hospital to receive care (Prigatano and Weinstein, 1996) or by staying in bed or using a wheelchair (Bisiach and Berti, 1995). Behavioral adaptation despite limited awareness may be used as an important treatment tool, for example, to foster patient adherence. However, only a few experimental studies have explored this topic. Their findings suggest that some patients with anosognosia for hemiplegia show motor adjustment to their condition, for example, by performing actions that could be done with either one or two hands in a manner consistent with their paralysis (Cocchini et al, 2010; Moro et al, 2011). With regard to AD, some clinical observations of patients have noted an adjustment to condition (eg, increased calendar use) despite unawareness of impairments (Mograbi and Morris, 2013). Experimental evidence, however, is sparse. One study by Moulin et al (2000) using word lists showed that although people with AD were inaccurate in their prediction of memory", "performance in terms of verbal judgments, they nevertheless allocated their study time appropriately in relation to the actual perform ance. Cotrell and Wild (1999) suggested that patients with AD may implement voluntary and self -initiated restrictions on driving in response to their impairments, and that this behavior is not especially associated with awareness of cognitive deficits. It is possible that such changes in behavior are caused by residual or fluctuating awareness, but in view of how patients sometimes rationalize behavioral change, it seems likely that implicit adaptation may be partially related to this phenomenon. Furthermor e, descriptive studies have suggested the presence of implicit learning in cases of patients presenting with amnesia for declarative memory in spite of limited awareness of their capacity (Schacter, 1990, 1992). This capacity seemed to extend to affective content of stimuli. Claparede (1911) illustrated this point by using a pin to prick the hand of a patient with dense anterograde amnesia while shaking hands with him. The next day the patient did not remember the events of the day before or Claparede himse lf, but nevertheless refused to shake his hand. When asked why, the patient gave an explanation unrelated to the previous day’s experience. Supporting this report and the idea of affective learning in spite of declarative memory deficits, Tranel and Damasi o (1993) described the case of a man with severe anterograde amnesia for all types of knowledge, including faces, who formed bonds with new people differently depending on the affective valence they exhibited. For example, although unable to recognize face s, the patient would choose, in a forced -choice paradigm, the face of an experimenter who had displayed positive affect toward him in preference to another who had displayed negative affect. This implicit learning dissipated with time, however, and at a 4 -year follow -up the patient responded indiscriminately to the faces. Implicit learning of affective valence has long been studied with amnesic patients using conditioning paradigms, and studies suggest that this learning is preserved even in profoundly amne sic patients (Weiskrantz and Warrington, 1979; see Woodruff -Pak, 1993, for a study with patient H.M.). More recently, it has been shown that people with AD experience prolonged states of emotion that persist beyond their declarative memory of exposure to emotional material (GuzmanVelez et al, 2014). Though scant, such data suggest an implicit processing of information about illness and failure in tasks that leads to emotional responses and behavioral change. These findings are consistent with the Cognitive Awareness Model, developed to explain different phenomena associated with", "anosognosia in AD (Agnew and Morris, 1998; Mograbi and Morris, 2014; Morris and Hannesdottir, 2004; Morris and Mograbi, 2013). This model postulates that anosognosia is heterogeneous , with potential executive (eg, error -monitoring deficits) or mnemonic (eg, lack of updating of personal information) presentations. Nevertheless, the model also suggests that the presence of relatively well -preserved mechanisms for error detection allows information about deficits or condition to be relayed to a parallel implicit route that bypasses consciousness, resulting in affective and behavioral regulation in the absence of metacognition. This idea was explored experimentally in a study (Mograbi et al, 2012a) that investigated emotional reactivity in response to performance on computerized memory or reaction time tasks in which difficulty levels were manipulated to make them either very easy or frustratingly hard for each participant. These were desig nated, respectively, as “success” and “failure” conditions. An AD group showed lack of awareness about performance relative to controls. However, the two groups showed similar emotional reactivity as measured by self -report and filming of facial expression s, with equally pronounced negative emotional expressions during the failure condition. These findings suggest that the AD group processed the affective valence of the failure experience even though their awareness of performance was impaired. This indicat es a dissociation of implicit processing of information and awareness (for studies showing that emotional features of stimuli modulate awareness, see Bertrand et al, 2016; Besharati et al, 2015; D’Imperio et al, 2017). In this study, we explored whether im plicit emotional responses to experiences of failure would result in longer -term change in behavior, as suggested by previous everyday observations but not yet studied experimentally. Would the AD group in the study by Mograbi et al (2012a) show relative changes in their future response to the “success” or “failure” condition tasks, despite their limited awareness of performance? To investigate this question, we saw the AD participants who participated in the previous study after 1 week and again administer ed the tasks. The previously “easy” or “difficult” tasks were now both set at medium difficulty and were administered so that the participants decided how long to persist on each one. The level of task persistence associated with failure was determined by comparing time spent doing the tasks, with the idea that participants would be more likely to stop a task if they had experienced failure on it in the first session. Such behavior would suggest implicit affective learning. In addition, we measured self -reported task motivation", "and enjoyment, with the idea that a previous experience of failure could adversely affect these variables.", "METHODS Participants Twenty -two participants with mild -to-moderate AD were recruited from either the South London and Maudsley/ Institute of Psychiatry Biomedical Research Centre Dementia Case Register or the St George’s Healthcare National Health Service Trust (London) Dementia Clinic. Diagnosis was based on Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fourth E dition) criteria for dementia of the Alzheimer type (American Psychiatric Association, 2000). In addition, patients were included if they had MiniMental State Examination (Folstein et al, 1975) scores of at least 18 (Mungas, 1991; National Institute for He alth and Care Excellence, 2006). Consecutive patients who fulfilled the study eligibility criteria were approached. We excluded those with a current neurologic disorder other than AD (patients with mixed AD and vascular dementia were also excluded), histor y of head injury resulting in loss of consciousness for more than 1 hour, history of alcohol or substance abuse (based on International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, criteria), history of diagnosed psychiatric disorder, or current comorbidity . Table 1 lists the clinical and demographic characteristics of the participants. The project was approved by the South London and Maudsley/Institute of Psychiatry Ethics Committee (Research Ethics Committee number 08/H0807/6).

For full details about the study and the development of the success - failure manipulation tasks, see Mograbi et al (2012a, 2014). The study consi sted of two sessions. Results from the first session, which compared patients with AD and controls, indicated that the patients showed poorer awareness of performance than controls but still preserved emotional reactivity to failure (Mograbi et al, 2012a). The focus of the present report is on task persistence in the second session. Because task persistence is related to failure in the first session, we here describe the configuration of the co mputer tasks for both sessions.", "First session: Titration and su ccess -failure m anipulation. We used a titration technique to match task difficulty across participants. The ability of each participant was first established individually by systematically increasing difficulty levels until consistent failure occurred. The participants then went on to a success -failure manipulation phase in which success or failure conditions were established by setting the difficulty level below or above, respectively, this performance threshold. For each participant, one of t he alternative versions of each of the two types of task was set with a threshold that led to a high level of task failure, and the other was set at a threshold that led to a high level of success. Participants were not informed that levels of difficulty would be manipulated, and the manipulations were disguised successfully (for details, see Mograbi et al, 2012a).", "Second session: Titration and persistence evaluation.", "After 1 week, the same tasks were again administered to the AD group. The 1 -week time gap was chosen based on pilot testing of the software using four patients with AD, the results of which indicated that patients would have no recollection of task performance after a week’s time (Mograbi et al, 2014). After performing the practice trials in the second session, the four patients were asked if they were familiar with this task. Two patients had no recollection of the previous testing, and two had a feeling of familiarity but were unable to describe their previous performance. For the second ses sion, the difficulty level was determined by repeating the titration procedure, taking into account potential variation in performance between sessions due to factors such as practice effect. After the titration, all tasks were set at a 50% level of perfor mance: success -failure manipulation computer software controlled difficulty levels over a block of trials arranged in a pseudo -random order, with five trials below and five trials above the participant’s success threshold in each. This overall approach was designed so that the task was difficult enough to motivate the participant to continue, but not so easy as to mask any prior experience persistence effect. The tasks were presented in the same order as in the first session, as described by Mograbi et al ( 2012a), with the order of experiments and conditions being quasi -counterbalanced between the participants as described previously (Mograbi et al, 2012a). For the sake of simplicity, tasks in the second session", "are referred to by their condition in the firs t session (success or failure), even though in the second session these tasks were set up to have the same level of success.", "Experiments In both experiments, parallel versions of the tasks, made distinctive by nonessential task features, were used, avoi ding task -related effects on motivation. These are described below.", "Experiment 1 – Reaction t ime In version 1 of the reaction time task, a car appears on a computer screen moving across the screen from left to right. The participant has to “stop” the car as soon as it appears by pressing a single centrally located box -housed button. If it is pressed, a “traffic warden” appears and there is a “clink” noise. In version 2 of the task, objects (eg, ball, egg, or vase) appear to fall from the top of a building. The participant has to “catch” the object by pressing the button as soon as the object appears. Success is signified by a “hand” appearing to catch the object, and the same “clink” noise. For both versions a warning tone sounds and after 164 milliseconds the object appears. If the participant fails to respond in time (before the car or object disappears from the screen), a “croak” noise signals failure. The practice trials ensured that the patients understood the meaning of the auditory feedback. Participa nts were told not to press the button before they saw the target or between trials. Task difficulty overall was manipulated by varying the object’s speed, quantified by pixels moved per screen refresh, from 12 (slowest) to 42 (fastest).", "Experiment 2 – Mem ory Memory span test procedures also used material presented on a computer screen. For version 1, pictures of one to ten identical everyday objects (eg, alarm clocks, baskets) are displayed scattered across the screen. For each trial the objects are highli ghted in a random sequence using a red square surround, and immediately afterward the participant has to point to the same objects in sequence. For version 2, the participant listens to the experimenter read a sequence of digits ranging from zero to nine, which are shown one at a time in the center of the screen. The participant then immediately repeats the numbers", "in the same sequence to the experimenter. For both versions, completely correct responses are indicated by a green visual “tick” and an auditory “clink,” and failure by a red cross and a “croak” sound. The shortest sequence of objects or digits was one and the longest was ten.", "Measures Figure 1 shows the order of procedures and assessments", "Figure 1. Protocol for Experiment 1 (Reaction time tasks) and Experiment 2 (Memory tasks). For Experiment 1 the titration phases continued until 3 consecutive mistakes, whilst for Experiment 2 this was for 2 consecutive mistakes. In Session 1, order of tasks and assignment of task version to condition (success or failure) was counterbalanced, with the constraint that participants never did two failure tasks consecutively. Order of tasks in Session 2 was the same as in Session 1 for all participants.", "Task p ersistence Persistence was measured by how long participants performed each task during the persistence phase of the second session. In this session, the computer tasks had no time limit and patients were instructed that they could stop the task whenever they liked. They were told, “Do this task for as long as you want, there is no expected minimum amount of time; it is really up to you.” The time was recorded from the end of the titration phase to the point at which the participant stopped performing the task. Howeve r, on three occasions, participants asked to stop the task before the end of the titration phase, and for", "these people their persistence time was considered to be 0 seconds. Because of the possibility that the patients would forget the instruction to stop when they wanted to, they were prompted again with the instructions 1 minute after the start of the persistence phase, and every 4 minutes thereafter.", "Self-reported motivation/e njoyment A 4-point scale was used to rate motivation and enjoyment correspondi ng with each computer task: 0 =“not at all,” 1=“a little,” 2= “somewhat,” 3= “a lot.” During the first session, ratings were obtained immediately after the practice trials but before starting the titration phase, when the participants were already familiar with the task demands. The participants were asked, “How motivated are you to do this task, from not at all to a lot?” and “How do you think you will enjoy doing this task, from not at all to a lot?” Further explanation was given if needed. Additionally, because answers to these questions could be influenced by demand characteristics (ie, the participants’ attempt to comply with the supposed experimental purpose), participants were told after each question and before their response, “Please answer honestly , if you think you are not motivated or will not enjoy it, you can say this. It is not a problem.” Participants were asked the same questions in the second session, again immediately after practice trials but before starting the titration phase. The invest igator also rated participants’ apparent motivation and enjoyment. These ratings were completed immediately after the self -rating procedure and used the same 4 -point scale. The investigator’s rating took into consideration not only the oral response of par ticipants but also other revealing details such as tone of voice, speed of response, and facial expression.", "Other measures Awareness of performance was not measured in the second session, as it was not the focus of the study. Nevertheless, during the first session an objective -judgment discrepancy (OJD) (Agnew and Morris, 1998) method had been used to measure awareness of performance. Immediately after the success or failure condition, participants were asked to rate how well they did on the task, using a rating scale of 0% to 100%, with 0%", "indicating that all trials were wrong and 100% that all trials were correct. Actual performance was subtracted from estimated ratings to create the OJD score, with positive results indicating overestimation of performance. Emotional reactivity was also measured in the first session (see Mograbi et al, 2012a, for more details). In summary, par ticipants completed a self -report questionnaire measuring four emotional dimensions (frustration, disappointment, embarrassment, and boredom), which were combined to produce a general index of negative or positive self -reported emotion. In addition, facial expressions were filmed and rated using the Facial Action Coding System (Ekman and Friesen, 1978). Unawareness about the dementia condition in general was also measured in the sample with the Anosognosia Questionnaire for Dementia (Migliorelli et al, 1995 ). This instrument relies on direct questioning of patient and informant, contrasting their answers to questions covering functional and behavioral problems commonly found during the course of dementia. Finally, use of the Consortium to Establish a Registr y for Alzheimer’s Disease word list memory task generated scores for immediate recall, delayed recall, recognition, and number of intrusions (Morris et al, 1989).", "Statistical a nalysis All analyses were performed separately for each experiment. To ensure t hat the experimental manipulation succeeded, a 2×2 repeated -measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) was calculated, with task type (success and failure) and session (first and second) as within -subject factors. To explore persistence in relation to task type , a one - tailed paired -samples t test was calculated to compare the time spent between the tasks that had been used previously in either success or failure conditions. These tests were recalculated as analyses of covariance (ANCOVAs) to allow the inclusion of covariates, with exploration of their impact on differences in persistence on success and failure condition tasks. Because of limited statistical power, only one covariate was included per analysis. A total of nine ANCOVAs were calculated, including one of the following variables as a covariate: cognitive level (Mini -Mental State Examination), awareness of condition (Anosognosia Questionnaire for Dementia), delayed recall (taken from the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer’s Disease test), e motional reactivity in", "the first session (intensity of facial expressions, repertoire of facial expressions, and self - reported emotion), and awareness of task performance in the first session (OJD scores for success and failure condition tasks). Cognitive level and awareness about condition were included because these general factors could be linked to decreased persistence. Delayed recall was included because better memory could result in explicit recall of the first session, influencing task persistence i n the second session. The influence of emotional reactivity was explored because stronger reactions in the first session could predict more pronounced avoidance of tasks subsequently. Finally, the aim of analyzing the relationship of persistence with task awareness (OJD) was to determine whether changes in persistence were associated with perception of performance in the first session (ie, encoding how well they actually did in the task). We calculated the influence of failure during the tasks in the second session as a complementary analysis because even though overall performance in the second session was controlled at 50%, this was done with a block of ten trials (five failures and five success) coming in random order. During the testing patients would fr equently stop the tasks after a sequence of trial failures. In order to test this response pattern statistically, the number of errors in the last three trials before participants stopped was recorded, and a one -sample t test against the expected mean of 1.5 failures (equal number of errors and correct answers) was calculated. This was done to explore whether participants were sensitive to errors in the second session and whether this could be a potential explanation for their stopping the tasks. Finally, t o investigate whether the change in motivation and enjoyment from the first to the second session was significantly different for the previous failure condition task compared with the previous success condition task, a motivation and enjoyment change score was created (for both self-report and investigator ratings). It was calculated as follows: change in second session equals motivation and/or enjoyment at start of second session minus motivation and/or enjoyment at start of first session. These two scores (change for success versus change for failure task) were then compared using a Wilcoxon signed rank test (Wilcoxon, 1947). This analysis was structurally equivalent to a parametric two -way ANOVA with time and condition as factors. In this analysis, to acc ount for the effect of multiple testing, P -values were adjusted by Bonferroni -Hochberg corrections (Hochberg, 1988) within each experiment. For all analyses, α was set at 0.05.", "RESULTS Data from the first session, reported in Mograbi et al (2012a), provide important context for the current study, particularly regarding the effectiveness of the success/failure manipulation.

For self - or investigator -rated motivation and enjoyment, there we re no differences in changes between success and failure tasks from the first to the second session.", "Persistence In both experiments, there were no significant differences in persistence for success relative to failure condition tasks. Means were in the predicted direction, but high variability meant the results were not significant. Nevertheless, the effect sizes we re small (Cohen’s d =0.16 and 0.31 for reaction time and memory tasks, respectively). The rationale behind our use of distinctive tasks in opposite conditions was that patients would associate each task with relative success or failure in the first session , and, based on this experience, exhibit task preference in the second session. The hypothesis of task preference in AD was based on anecdotal evidence, but the lack of such an effect is not entirely surprising given that associative learning processes, su ch as classical conditioning, have been found to be impaired in AD (Hoefer et al, 2008; Woodruff -Pak et al, 1996). However, it is not clear whether deficits in conditioning in AD are due mainly to impaired response to unconditioned stimuli or to a specific impairment in learning mechanisms (Hamann et al, 2002). In a previous study, AD patients were able to exhibit emotional responses to these tasks (Mograbi et al, 2012a); thus it seems that the lack of significant differences in task persistence in the seco nd session may be attributed to impairments specific to learning. An important finding related to understanding behavioral change was the association of awareness of task performance in the first session with persistence in the second session, with better awareness predicting more persistence later on. This result was consistent for awareness of success for both experiments, and also present for failure in the memory tasks. The fact that this result was", "stronger for awareness of success condition tasks may suggest that, rather than being a case of task avoidance, this effect would be more aptly described as an increase in persistence following success. While this finding is initially counterintuitive, as it might suggest that acquired implicit response to fa ilure depends on awareness, there are various ways of explaining it. Awareness provides a stimulus with wider contextual linking and correlational abilities. In other words, when we are aware of something, we become aware of its relationship with other thi ngs (Weiskrantz, 1997). One possible explanation of why initial awareness was associated with long -term behavioral change is the complexity of the learning involved. Learning the valence of the computer tasks is arguably more complex than basic implicit le arning, such as in classical conditioning. For example, knowledge about emotional states caused by the tasks involves an attributional level, which may be more fully accessed with awareness. According to this perspective, awareness would be needed to integ rate information fully, creating a “global workspace” in which different sources of information (eg, cognitive, emotional, behavioral) are linked (Baars, 1997). It is also possible that the experience of initial failure with awareness has a longer -lasting consequence on behavior than that without it; this may be particularly important for cases in which subsequent explicit recollection of stimulus properties is not possible. Perhaps with shorter time gaps, initial awareness would not be such a relevant factor. Here the distinction between phenomenal and access consciousness may prove relevant (Block, 1995). Although the immediate experience of failure (ie, phenomenal consciousness) may lead to shortterm adaptation, only an initial moment of reasoning and cognitive control (ie, access consciousness) would lead to long -term behavioral change. Finally, it is also probable that the emotional impact of the tasks was not strong enough to cause long -term implicit learning on its own, and richer encoding of experienc e was necessary, even if this information subsequently degraded and led to impaired recollection of previous contact with the tasks. Whatever the case may be, this study shows that patients are capable of exhibiting long -term avoidance of tasks on which th ey had performed poorly, even without having memory of previous performance, given that those patients were aware of their initial task performance. That is, once the information is acquired and processed within awareness, with widespread linking and impro ved appraisal of contextual cues, it exerts implicit effects on behavior even if explicit memory of the tasks is unavailable. This may be particularly important from a clinical point of", "view, highlighting the need to provide information about ability to pa tients with awareness in order for long -term adaptation in relation to treatment to occur.", "Number of e rrors before stopping the Tasks In both experiments participants consistently stopped the tasks after a sequence of trial failures, at a level significan tly above chance. For both experiments, the number of errors before stopping is higher for tasks in which AD patients previously succeeded, although this is a nonsignificant marginal difference. It is possible that the effects of previous performance are m ore evident in a context of failure, and perhaps if tasks had been set up for failure instead of being neutral (ie, 50% success) in the second session, more marked differences in task avoidance would have been evident. In any case, this finding suggests that AD patients’ task avoidance was also influenced by performance in the second session, with failures leading to giving up on the task (ie, less persistence). Even though awareness of performance in the second session was not measured, the observed behavi or may indicate that patients are able to monitor their performance at least on a trial -bytrial basis, and that successive experience of failure decreases task persistence in AD, consistent with the study’s hypothesis. This is also in agreement with previo us studies on metacognition in AD, which indicate that patients can revise estimations of performance following feedback, but that after a delay this information degrades and estimations revert to pretesting levels (Ansell and Bucks, 2006; Souchay, 2007; S tewart et al, 2010). This seems to suggest that unawareness in the current sample may be caused more by a problem of integration and consolidation of information than by deficits in error processing. These highlights, clinically, how patients may be able t o respond to feedback about performance, at least in the short term.", "Enjoyment and motivation r atings Comparison of pretesting motivation and enjoyment ratings from the first and second sessions indicated no significant differences regardless of experiment and rating type", "(self- or investigator -reported). Data in Tables 2 and 3 indicate a trend toward reve rsion of AD patients’ ratings in the second session to the pretesting levels of the first session. This suggests that, at least at an explicit/ declarative level, patients did not exhibit any long-term changes in motivation or enjoyment in response to the initial experience of failure.", "Limitations and s ummary By design, the current study, focusing on the second session of testing, had no formal measures of the participants’ memory of the first session. We did not want to risk biasing the participants’ expe ctations concerning the nature of this study. Also, we took into account the findings of a pilot study that had shown that patients with similar levels of neuropsychological impairment were clearly unable to remember the tasks or their performance after a 1-week gap in testing. In the study reported here, only one participant spontaneously expressed a vague feeling of familiarity with the tasks but was unable to provide details about performance, and his scores in the second session were in no way atypical. Moreover, ANCOVA including performance in a memory test did not indicate an influence of this factor in task persistence. Measures of executive functions, particularly perseverance, would have been useful and could be employed in future investigations of implicit behavioral change in AD. The current study did not have a control group, again based on the converse idea that the controls would remember task performance in a second session 1 week after the first and so the study would not be measuring implicit adaptation in this group. Further studies would be of interest using these procedures with very long time intervals for control participants, sufficient to cause forgetting of the task experience. Finally, the sample studied was limited in terms of both the heterogeneity of cognitive impairment and actual size, which could have contributed to the null finding when comparing persistence between success and failure. Nevertheless, as indicated above, the effect sizes obtained were small, such that if there were differences for this patient type, it might be that only much larger samples would deliver significant results. In conclusion, these results indicate that experience of failure influenced persistence, and that implicit task avoidance can occur 1 week af ter exposure to failure, but that this is related to the degree of initial awareness of performance. These", "findings suggest that initial awareness may influence long -term adaptation. In the context of AD, in which variations of preserved awareness or monit oring of task performance are present, the extent of preservation may play an important role in adaptation, even if memory of experience of tasks is lost. Future studies are needed to expand knowledge about implicit behavioral change in AD.", "ACKNOWLEDGEMEN TS The authors acknowledge the help of Simon Lovestone, PhD, Megan Pritchard, BSc, Robert Lawrence, PhD, and Stephen Jackson, PhD, with the recruitment of participants for the studies.

Considering this, there is a multiplicity of “selves,” the current review suggesting that seven fundamental self -processes can be identified that further our understanding of the experience of dementia. These include (1) an embodied self, manifest as corporeal awareness; (2) an agentic self, related to being an agent and influencing life circumstances; (3) an implicit self, linked to non-conscious self-processing; (4) a critical self, which defines the core of self -identity; (5) a surrogate self, based on third -person perspective information; (6) an extended self, including external objects or existences that are incorporated into the self; and, finally, (7) an emergent self, a property of the self -processes that give rise to the sense of a unified self. These are discussed in relation to self -awareness and their use in making sense of the experience of dementia.", "KEYWORDS : dementia, Alzheimer’s disease, selfhood, self, awareness.", "INTRODUCTION Despite the elusiveness of the concept, most of us can apprehend the notion of the self. In everyday life, our access to the world happens through a first -person perspective. Philosophically, approaches to understanding the self have been developing, a mai n one being that the self is ontologically subjective (1); for example, in his philosophy of mind, William James suggesting that feelings and thoughts only exist in relation to an experiencer of the experience (1, 2). Searle (1) defines this as a fundament al property of consciousness, namely, first -person ontology. The first -person perspective of most of our experiences attest, from a phenomenological point of view, the idea of an underlying construct that modulates our apprehension of the world: the self.", "Further evidence for this property of our minds is seen by the plethora of alterations in self-experience caused by neurological and psychiatric conditions. The range and variety of these self -changes indicate that these phenomena are underpinned by multip le neural processes, with different aspects of the self being linked to the activity of specific brain regions. It is important to highlight that, when discussing the self, we are referring to processes and not to something inside our brains. This avoids r eifying the concept, which could lead to a homunculus fallacy (3). Similarly, as it will be seen in the next sections, these self -processes extend through different levels of complexity. This is a crucial point, indicating that there is no circularity or i nfinite regress.", "Indeed, the experience of the self is the likely interaction of a multiplicity of self - processes. Different brain networks, in interaction with the environment, including interpersonal values and cultural norms, lead to diverse self -related abilities, such as bodily awareness, agency, and autobiographical memory, amongst others (4). It has been suggested that these different forms of self may have a hierarchical relationship, with some self -processes establishing themselves earlier on and providing the scaffolding for higher -order processes (5). In this nested hierarchy approach, certain aspects of the self have a central position, responding to essential processes that allow the emergence of other complex self phenomena (5).", "Exploring the processes that concern the “self” in dementia has many important consequences. Considering the progressive neurodegenerative characteristic of dementia, relatives and caregivers may struggle to see beyond the condition as a diagnosis and disease state. Thi s may lead to caring practices that diminish personhood in dementia,", "which has been termed “malignant social psychology” (6). Institutional and individual practices with depersonalizing elements not only disempower and stigmatize people with dementia (PwD) but also undermine them, potentially causing excess disability (7). Investigating how self -processes are affected by dementia may support humanizing care practices, relying on preserved abilities and promoting personhood in the condition. However, for thi s to happen effectively, an appreciation of the impact of dementiarelated impairments is needed. Only by knowing which aspects of the self are more resilient to change and which ones are vulnerable to the losses caused by dementia can we achieve better sta ndards of care for PwD and their families.", "Considering this, the current article aims to discuss how selfprocesses can be impacted by dementia. Specifically, seven forms of the self will be explored: embodied, agentic, critical, implicit, surrogate, exten ded, and emergent. These seven aspects of the self were selected as main constructs that explain the totality of the self and that have been considered individually in relation to PwD, also taking into account clinical phenomena; the final concept of self, namely, “the emergent self,” was generated to incorporate the missing notion that the different aspects may interact to form emergent properties, the sum being greater than the constituent parts. These aspects of self will be discussed in relation to exis ting evidence, from both a cognitive neuroscience approach and a social psychology/ethnographic approach. Future research directions and the clinical implications of these forms of self are explored in the conclusion.", "SEVEN FORMS OF SELF IN DEMENTIA Embo died Self Accumulating evidence in the literature suggests that our body plays an essential role in the constitution of a sense of self (5). In this context, the body is not seen as a part of the physical world but as a vehicle that allows us to be a self in this world (8 –10). Some researchers attribute the embodied self to bodily capacities, such as multisensory integration, interoception, and agency (11), which occur at an implicit level and emerge as a unified experience of the body via perception and a ction (12 –14). Considering the various aspects of the embodied self, studies suggested that its neural correlates involve posterior brain regions, particularly the temporoparietal junction and the extrastriate body area (15, 16). In a recent resting -state functional connectivity study, Piras et al. (17)", "suggest that the activity of the brain at rest is influencing individual selfattribution by linking somatosensory representations to visual and proprioceptive information (17). Moreover, the embodied self is described to be essential in the foundation of other kinds of selves, which rely on higher levels of brain function (5, 18). In fact, it has been argued, in the context of dementia, that bodily processes may provide the basis for structuring or preserving some cognitive abilities (19).", "Considerable evidence has been generated indicating the endurance of the self in PwD, despite cognitive decline. For example, Kontos (20), in an ethnographic study, demonstrates that aspects of the self may persist in peopl e with severe dementia. A potential explanation for these findings is that the embodied dimension of human existence is, as suggested above, grounded ontologically on implicit processes (21), with the embodied self preceding and not having to emerge from c ognitive forms of knowledge (20). Such processes are more resilient in relation to neurodegeneration, being structured by interaction with bodily control. This embodied dimension may manifest itself through action, such as dancing, caring, and gestural com munication, referring to the complex inter-relationship between corporeal (i.e., physical movement) and social characteristics of the body (i.e., the social and personal meaning of the movement) [(20, 21), for a review, One important feature of the embodied self refers to our gestures during communication (i.e., facial expression, gaze, movements of the body, intonation, and tone of voice), which are considered a form of natural expression of the body (8). Gestures are an important topic when discus sing dementia, as they provide a different perspective on how PwD communicate. It has been shown that PwD who have lost language abilities are still able to communicate non -verbally, through eye gaze, facial expressions, and movement (23, 24). In relation to facial expressions, although PwD have shown impairments in recognition, a number of studies have suggested preserved, albeit attenuated, facial reactivity to emotional stimuli, such as films (25), computer tasks (26), and faces (27). In these studies, r esponses of participants were coherent with the emotional stimuli, suggesting preserved bodily processes that are present even in severe stages of the condition [e.g., (27)]. Similarly, reactivity to pain stimuli with facial expressions has also been shown across severity levels in dementia (28).", "Another example of the embodied self refers to artistic expression and creativity by drawing, which is often maintained in dementia. There are descriptions in the literature of people in later stages of Alzheimer’ s disease (AD) with severe cognitive impairments, who, nevertheless, preserve the ability to draw (29, 30). In this case, the longer -lasting persistence of creativity is associated with the embodied self, as it represents the expressiveness of the body, de spite or beyond cognition. In other words, the body is capable of learning and transforming its perception into something meaningful and symbolic (31).", "An important topic when considering the embodied self in PwD is appearance (20). For instance, some aut hors have suggested the importance of maintaining gendered appearance (i.e., haircut, clothing, and cosmetics) as a form of support for the self in dementia (32 –34). Gove (35) argues that one of the critical factors that lead to stigmatization is when PwD appearance is not considered adequate in certain social contexts. Given the loss of autonomy for self -care (e.g., bathing and dressing) in later stages of dementia, this may lead to alienating PwD in relation to their appearance, with family members or car egivers assuming these responsibilities and adopting their own way or institutional norms to conduct these activities (35). Considering this, some authors have suggested that, more important than the final result, the process used to take care of PwD appea rance is a crucial factor in structuring the self at this level (36, 37). While the embodied self is shown to have levels of preservation in dementia, there is evidence that interoceptive processing (i.e., awareness of visceral states) is impaired in the condition. In a neuroimaging study (38), people with AD (PwAD) and behavioral - variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) showed resting -state functional connectivity alterations in specific hubs of the fronto -temporo -insular network, which were associated with impairment on different interoceptive dimensions (accuracy, learning, and awareness). Both patient groups showed reduced interoceptive awareness, overestimating their ability to detect interoceptive changes, with changes in heartbeat and learning using stethoscopic feedback (interoceptive learning). The AD group exhibited a differential deficit in such learning, arguably linked to memory dysfunction. Other interoceptive disruptions, particularly associated with altered pain and temperature processing, wer e also reported in bvFTD, with both hyper - and hypo -responsiveness observed (39). These disruptions were associated with grey matter volume of the right mid and posterior insula", "(39, 40). Studies exploring the neural correlates of interoceptive awareness i n healthy population highlight similar networks, including specifically the insular cortex (41, 42).", "Agentic Self The experience of controlling one’s own actions and, through them, influencing the course of external events has been termed “sense of agen cy” (43). A central aspect of this phenomenon involves the subjective experience of a voluntary action, including the intend to act, the choice between possible actions, and the initiation of these actions, which relies essentially on cognitive processes ( 44, 45). An additional aspect involved in the sense of agency is experiences related to the feeling of ownership subjacent to the activity of peripheral somatosensory receptors while the body is moving, also termed volition (43). Finally, the sense of agen cy includes the association between the subjective experience of one’s own action and the observed changes in the external world caused by one’s own action.", "Agency is incorporated into neurological models of anosognosia, or awareness of deficit, such as t he feedforward intentional model by Heilman, Barrett, and Adair (46) in which signals relating to intention to act are compared with kinesthetic action signals to regulate awareness of bodily action, also providing a sense of agency. The neural correlates subjacent to the sense of agency are still unclear; nevertheless, evidence suggests that agency may rely on the connectivity between frontal and prefrontal motor areas involving the initiation of movements and the parietal cortex supporting the monitoring of perceptual events [for a review, see (43)]. In addition, new insights from neuroimaging studies highlighted the role of resting -state activity in regions responsible for preparing information for visuo -motor integration. Specifically, it has been sugges ted that the activity of the brain at rest in action -related perceptual and motor circuits needs to interact in order to create a feeling of control over events (17).", "In a social psychology perspective, agency is understood as people proactively participa ting in their development, adaptation, and actualization of self -knowledge, following changes over time (47 –49). Bandura (49) describes three core features of human agency: (1) forethought, which is related to the adaptation of self -interest using past exp eriences in order to provide direction, coherence, and meaning to one’s life and involving the capacity of anticipation and visualization of goals and outcomes to motivate", "efforts; (2) self -reactiveness, linked to self -regulation and motivation of actions during the execution of a plan; and (3) self -reflectiveness, which is associated with the role of people not only as agents of actions but also as self -examiners of their own functioning, including evaluation of performance, integrity and meaning of though ts and actions, and adjustment to possible errors.", "Agency is normally explored focusing on decision -making and self -reflective capacities, which are directly linked to different cognitive abilities, including language, deliberative thoughts, and intention al and goal -oriented actions (49, 50). For example, the dissociable interactions and conscious experience model by Schacter (51) considers that interaction between basic cognitive abilities is mediated by consciousness. The literature suggests that a combi ned deficit in decision making and self -reflection in PwD may result in diminished sense of agency (52). A more extensive concept of agency might be needed considering the experiences of agency in people with cognitive difficulties. Models such as those pr oposed by Kontos (53), based on a phenomenological perspective, respond to this demand, understanding agency in PwD as originating principally from bodily information, action, and goal -directed behaviour (44, 45). Additionally, acknowledging the socio -emot ional, in addition to the cognitive, basis of reflexivity would enable the recognition of agency in PwD, even in severe stages of the condition (54, 55). Current findings support this notion. For example, Boyle (56) explored the potential for agency in peo ple with mild and moderate dementia, and results showed that while participants present with difficulties in decision -making capacity, they were able, however, to demonstrate a sense of agency through behavioural and emotional responses (56). Another important aspect discussed in the literature refers to a possible relation between agency and autonomy (57). In the context of impairments in decision making in dementia, few possibilities are offered to PwD in their daily life to make choices and, therefore, to practice and maintain a sense of agency and autonomy. In a systematic review exploring the experience of agency in PwD, Bosco et al. (57) described three different decision - making pathways, reflecting the degree of autonomy and agency in thi s group: decision making, shared decision making, and pseudo decision making. Each of these pathways has a different impact on the agency of PwD, encouraging or discouraging decision - making practices (57).", "A few studies explored social interferences in hum an agency in the context of dementia. For example, Boyle and Warren (55) investigated whether people with severe dementia demonstrate emotional reflexivity within their personal relationships (i.e., PwD and their spouses). The authors observed that, even w hen PwD abilities for deliberation, discourse, and social interaction were limited, they could nevertheless demonstrate emotional reflexive abilities necessary to exercise agency within their daily lives. This suggests that PwD might express their selves u sing mechanisms other than verbal language, such as perception, feelings, and desires in habituated, embodied, and emotional forms (55). Furthermore, Chung et al. highlighted the strategies adopted by carers that encourage and sustain a sense of autonomy a nd agency in PwD, reinforcing the importance of social factors for agency in this group (58).", "In conclusion, the findings emphasize the relevance of assisted autonomy in dementia, including support for practicing and maintaining a sense of agency, which i s closely linked to personhood in PwD (59). Such practices allow patients to engage in meaningful activities, with individuals gaining a sense of choice, commitment, positive meaning, and interaction (60). By contrast, it has been shown that lack of such s upport can lead to behavioural and psychological symptoms, including restlessness, wandering, depression, and agitation (58).", "Implicit Self Damasio suggests that part of the information that grounds our sense of self exist in implicit states (18). This is in accordance with research on social cognition, which indicates the existence of knowledge about the self, in forms inaccessible for consci ousness (e.g., unaware thoughts and emotions) but which can be tapped indirectly (61). Moreover, there is a substantial body of clinical and experimental evidence that shows that behavioural and affective responses can be influenced by implicit information processing in a variety of neurological conditions [for a review, (62)]. In this context, the implicit self is related to responses that suggest self representations, preferences, and attitudes that are implicit in nature. The neural correlates of implici t self -awareness are still unclear in the literature; however, studies exploring this phenomenon with neurological patients suggest that implicit processing involves more subcortical regions, such as the basal ganglia and the amygdala, compared with explic it processing,", "supporting more cortical regions (63, 64). In line with these neural findings, authors suggested the existence of parallel routes, implicit and explicit cognitive mechanisms, for processing of similar information (62, 65, 66).", "PwD often lac k awareness about their condition and associated changes, neurologically referenced as anosognosia (67). Awareness in PwD is often assessed by contrasting self - report, at an explicit level, with clinician/informant opinion or performance in tasks (68). Nevertheless, it has long been noted that despite explicit unawareness, PwD may adjust their behaviour and activities, responding to the experience of the illness (69, 70), and this has been incorporated in models of self -awareness (71). For example, the cogn itive awareness model [CAM; (71 – 73)] suggests a parallel route to process implicit information about ability [see also Piras et al. (74) for an extension of this model and an exploration of self -awareness in people with mild cognitive impairment]. This no tion was developed considering clinical observation suggesting that unawareness paradoxically can be accompanied by signs of understanding or representation of difficulties, which are not explicitly expressed (62). This may occur through jokes; symbolic re ferences to dementia -related disabilities, which are not acknowledged; or compliance with treatment and caregiving practices even though such care might not be deemed necessary to the person, due to lack of awareness (62).", "Additionally, a number of studie s investigating emotional reactivity and behavioural changes in dementia have supported the notion of processes linked to implicit self phenomena. In terms of emotional reactivity, this has been observed, for example, in attentional biases, including heigh tened implicit reactivity to dementia -related material. Martyr et al. (75) used a modified form of the emotional Stroop including dementia - related words, with bias toward such words indicated by slower responding. Both PwD and their carers showed an increa se in response times to salient compared with neutral words. Additionally, in patients, this effect was unrelated to their levels of awareness of condition (75). These findings are indicative of the operation of emotional interference at an automatic uncon scious processing level and that awareness may be retained at an implicit level.", "Further evidence for an implicit self in dementia has been obtained in a study that explored emotional reactivity to film material in mild AD (25). Participants watched neutr al, negative, and positive film clips, with the negative material containing a film", "about dementia and another about cancer. Despite attenuated responses, reactivity in PwAD was consistent with valence of the stimuli. Critically, higher frequency of negati ve facial expressions was observed in patients with reduced awareness. This was interpreted as representing implicit self -processes, with unaware PwAD presenting “leakage” of involuntary expressions, and implicit awareness leading to reactivity, which bypa sses voluntary control (25). Preserved emotional reactivity to the experience of failure in tasks despite reduced awareness has also been observed in PwAD (26).", "In relation to behavioural adaptation, evidence has been produced in both observational studie s and experimental settings. Self -imposed driving restrictions despite unawareness difficulties have been observed in PwAD (76), with adaptations such as relying on co - pilots (77) and avoiding driving in unfamiliar environments (78). In the context of research into metacognition, Moulin, Perfect, and Jones found that PwAD allocated their study time appropriately (reducing time for repeated materials) despite an inability to predict performance explicitly in an accurate manner (79). The efficient allocation of study time would indicate that some strategic, but likely unaware, processing was going on. Using estimations of confidence in a forced -choice perceptual task, Geurten et al. (80) report that, although explicit metacognition is impaired in PwAD, implici t introspection may be preserved. Specifically, PwAD asked for cues more often after incorrect than after correct responses, in levels similar to controls, despite limited explicit acknowledgment of poor performance (80). It has also been shown that PwAD p ersistence in tasks is directly influenced by current performance, with tasks being stopped more often after a sequence of errors (81).", "Altogether, these findings suggest implicit affective processing, preferences, and self - knowledge. One issue that has n ot been clarified, yet, is the extent to which long -term implicit affective preference and behavioural change can be observed. Some studies have suggested that emotional responses linger in PwAD despite loss of declarative memory for the events that caused the emotion. This has been seen in response to films (82) and music (83). In the study by Bomilcar et al., long -term task preference was explored with participants doing tests that had been performed a week before either in a success or failure condition (81). Task preference in the second session was only observed when awareness of performance in the first session was included in statistical models,", "suggesting initial moments of awareness may boost long -term adaptation even if the content is not available explicitly anymore (81).", "Critical Self A crucial aspect of our sense of self refers to the explicit records of information we hold about ourselves, i.e., autobiographical memory. When we are asked who we are, typically it is to autobiographical memory that we resort to provide an answer. Memory may be responsible for continuity, one of the core features of the self. It is not surprising, then, that a number of theories have highlighted its role in the maintenance of a sense of self. For example, Conway, following the original philosophical structure of Locke (84), suggests a reciprocal relationship between long -term memory and the self, with memory constraining the structure of the self, and the self modulating encoding and retrieval of memory (85). Dama sio proposes an autobiographical self, made of past memory records as well as future thinking about ourselves, that enriches more basic forms of the self - based on bodily phenomena (18, 86). It is important to highlight that no reified autobiographical self is needed, leading to an infinite regress; the memory records themselves provide a sense of autobiographical self.", "Following the Cognitive Awareness Model (CAM) (71 –73), lack of awareness is considered a heterogeneous phenomenon, with primary, executive, and mnemonic forms of anosognosia. In conditions such as AD, mnemonic anosognosia may be the main form of unawareness. The model postulates that personal information is consolidated and updated into a storage for personal information [personal data base ( PDB)]. Normally, the PDB is continuously updated by experience; however, in PwAD, memory impairments hinder this process. Considering the relationship between self and memory from the perspective of memory changes and loss of self -awareness in dementia, th e notion of a “petrified self ” has been suggested (4, 87). This term was used, as a metaphor, to highlight two main features of loss of self -awareness linked to memory loss in AD. Firstly, given the damage to medial temporal lobe structures and the result ing pattern of anterograde amnesia, updating of selfconcept would be reduced, with PwD incorporating limited new knowledge about themselves. Secondly, remote autobiographical information, particularly semantic memory, which has long been consolidated and acquired hippocampal independence, would support a core identity in PwD. Hence, the", "metaphor tried to capture the notion of an autobiographical sense of self in PwD, particularly in AD, that was relatively resilient based on personal history, but with less capacity to incorporate new autobiographical knowledge.", "In the context of the current article, focus will be given to the latter aspect of that formulation; a nucleus of self -identity formed before the beginning of the condition, which grounds self -concep t despite memory loss. It is based on the retrieval of autobiographical information, including recent and remote memories, which is supported by a diffuse network involving different regions such as the hippocampus, and medial prefrontal and parietal corti ces (88, 89). This is termed here a critical self, as an analogy with the notion of critical periods of development. It has been shown that autobiographical memory follows a consistent distribution cross -culturally, with features such as a recency effect ( better recall of recent information, as observed in other memory processes) and infantile amnesia (85). Another recurrent aspect is the presence of a “reminiscence bump,” with higher recollection of autobiographical memories from adolescence and early adul thood [for a review, Munawar et al. (90)]. Several explanations have been provided for this phenomenon, ranging from the neurobiological [maturation of the frontal lobes; (4)] to the social (life script and identity accounts), which stress an early critica l phase of development of the self, which draws on memories around early adulthood (91, 92). It is likely that these two levels of explanations interact. Evidence for a reminiscence bump in AD has been seen in the form of better recall of remote vs. recent material, with a temporal gradient for episodic and semantic autobiographical memory in this condition (93 –96). There are, however, studies that did not report differences in memory retrieval across life periods in AD [e.g., Irish et al. (97)]. Barnabe et al. have suggested that the method used to elicit memories may have an important impact in the presence of a reminiscence bump (98), with the autobiographical interview (99) leading to a reduced temporal gradient due to allocation of fewer memories to a h igher number of life periods.", "Interestingly, the pattern of autobiographical recollection seems to be reversed for semantic dementia, with better recall of recent as opposed to remote memories (100). This highlights the different neural substrates for mem ories according to their consolidation status. Most of the evidence seems to indicate that episodic memory relies on the hippocampus, being impaired early in AD and showing a steeper gradient than semantic", "memory, only affected in later stages of the condi tion [for a review, see Lenzoni et al. (87)]. This suggests that the critical self in AD is based on remote personal memories, particularly personal semantics, the cognitive store of personal information. It follows that memories from early adulthood are p articularly important in the identity of PwAD, with their continued existence (100).", "The resilience of this critical self in AD has been investigated in recent studies. El Haj et al. have shown how people with mild AD think about their life stories to mai ntain continuity in their sense of self, relying more than healthy controls on their autobiographical memory when concerned about potential threats to continuity (101). Research exploring sense of subjective continuity in dementia indicated that most PwD (79%) experience continuity, with those who do not presenting with poorer psychological health (102). Crucially, Tippett et al. suggest that self -continuity may be maintained in AD despite impairments in episodic recollection (that support phenomenological continuity), through the construction of life narratives from semantic memory (semantic continuity) (103). Their findings suggest that better semantic continuity may be particularly relevant for explanations of self -continuity, while confidence in self - persistence may be linked to general and less sophisticated continuity explanations (103).", "Surrogate Self The surrogate self is composed of mental representations that are not based on neurocognitive systems representing directly the self, being usually el icited through information processing involving perspective -taking abilities. Perspective -taking is a complex and multifaceted phenomenon encompassing social and cognitive aspects and refers to the ability of taking someone else’s position or point of view (104). Perspective - taking is understood as an essential ability for our social life, having an important role in the history of our species (104, 105). Indeed, authors defend that perspective -taking is closely related to two important aspects of our socia l behavior: empathy (106) and theory of mind (107). According to Wilson and Dunn, reflective processing on the self through a third -person perspective may be particularly useful to update beliefs of our own personality (108). In this context, information c oming from perspectivetaking about the self might influence first -person perspective reflection and, thus, improve self -awareness (109, 110). The surrogate self relies on the cognitive ability of perspectivetaking, which", "is dependent on executive functioni ng, specifically on switching and inhibition capacities (111). Regarding its neuroanatomical substrates, studies showed that perspectivetaking tasks engage a diffuse network including the prefrontal cortex, the temporoparietal junction, and the precuneus [ for a review, see Healey and Grossman (106)]. Based on empirical findings, theoretical models have suggested distinct memory systems supporting processing of self - and other -information (71). According to the CAM (71), appraisal of personal information is based on autobiographical memory, generated by individual, social, and cultural experiences and recorded as both experienced events and semanticized self -representations. Other -appraisal, however, relies on general semantic knowledge, stored in different brain systems. It is this generic memory system that can be used for appraisal of others, potentially acting as a surrogate self, allowing people unaware of their difficulties to recognize impairments when exposed to information from an external perspectiv e. Nevertheless, the authors defend that such benefit to self - awareness would depend on the integrity of semantic knowledge and perspective -taking ability (71).", "The significance of a surrogate self is seen in the influence of perspective -taking on self - awareness in neurological and psychiatric conditions. A number of studies suggested that self-observation by stroke patients in a third -person perspective leads to increased awareness of motor deficits (112 –114). Similar results have been reported for people with psychosis presenting reduced insight (115 –117).", "In the context of dementia, clinical observations suggest that unaware PwD may be able to acknowledge difficulties similar to their own in others (71). To explore this issue empirically, Clare et al. u sed a vignette technique as an indirect method to assess awareness in PwD (118). The findings suggested that participants, even when presenting some level of unawareness, were able to correctly identify and give coherent advice for the problem experienced by a third person in the vignette. Additionally, exposure to vignettes helped some of the participants to identify with the situation presented in the vignette spontaneously (118). The use of vignette methodology, but worded in a first - person perspective, has also indicated that PwD make choices comparable with those of controls in relation to advance directives on treatment preferences for life -sustaining interventions [e.g., use of a feeding tube or antibiotics; (119)]. Preservation of aspects of", "surrogat e self -representation may form the basis for adapted uses of cognitive therapy approaches in people in the early stages of dementia.", "The surrogate self in dementia may be affected, however, by neurocognitive impairment. Perspective -taking difficulties hav e been suggested in the context of dementia, possibly reducing self -awareness (120 –122). For example, when assessing the relevance of personality traits adjectives for themselves and for a relative taking a third -person perspective, AD patients showed dimi nished accuracy of their judgment compared with controls (123). Simm et al. found that cognitive impairments were associated with reductions in reflective self -function, with personal reflective function being influenced by memory difficulties and social r eflective function showing an association with processing speed impairments (124). Neuroimaging findings indicate that, when asked to use a third -person perspective, PwAD activate prefrontal regions, potentially relying more on reasoning processes, while o lder controls recruited visual associative areas, suggesting the use of visual imagery of autobiographical memories (105). The capacity to use perspective -taking as a way of increasing self -awareness may also be affected by abilities beyond cognition. For example, Mograbi et al. indicated that premorbid personality may be an important factor when evaluating the difficulty of tasks for self and others (125). The authors showed that higher neuroticism and agreeableness were linked to attribution of more diff iculty for self/less difficulty for others (125). It has also been suggested that affective components of social cognition are fairly preserved in AD, which may be used to compensate for cognitive components that show impairments [for a review, (126)].", "Extended Self The concept of extended cognition is characterized by the notion that minds and cognitive systems are grounded on embodied agents interacting with external sources. According to this view, the environment has an active role in driving cognition, which is u nderstood as going beyond brain processes (127). In this context, environmental processes are represented by external sources, as material vehicles of cognition, such as numbers, words, and symbols (128, 129). Further examples of extended cognition include the use of media [such as photos and films; (130)], multi -sensory environmental (131), or evocative objects (132), that allow individuals to remember their past. These include, for", "example, the PwD home environment, in which longstanding familiarity with objects and architecture may provide support for action.", "Departing from this perspective, a notion of extended self can be derived by considering the nature of the relationship between external objects and the self. For example, James suggests that we con sider external objects as part of ourselves if they are able to induce affective states (2), whereas McClelland emphasizes agency and sense of control for the incorporation of objects into the self (133). Belk goes beyond the notion of objects being a part of the self, suggesting they also may define a sense of self (134). In this perspective, four levels of extended self are suggested: individual (e.g., personal possessions as jewellery, automobile, make -up, and clothing); family (e.g., residence and furni shings); community (i.e., neighbourhood); and group (e.g., social groups) (134). In this sense, and adopting a cognitive perspective, Heersmink (135, 136) argues that the extended self is related to the autobiographical memory. Indeed, the environment, including objects and people, aids the individual to remember personal memories, which is necessary to create a narrative self. Therefore, we can suggest that the extended self might support and interact with a network involving the hippocampus, and medial prefrontal and parietal cortices (88, 89).", "The concept of extended cognition may be particularly relevant for PwD, given the cognitive loss that characterizes the condition. Clark and Chalmers describe a classical thought experiment where Otto, a man with AD, uses a notebook as a memory system (128). The information Otto needs is stored in his notebook and it is accessible for him, as memories “stored” in a properly functioning semantic memory system are, for a person without memory impairments, being simil arly available to consciousness and able to guide actions. Otto’s notebook is an external artefact integrated in his overall memory system, constituting a central part of his identity and acting as a cognitive agent (128, 129). From an empirical perspectiv e, a number of studies investigated the role of assistive technology in fostering memory and other abilities in PwD (137), with recent work also summarizing results in relation to electronic devices (138). Findings have indicated that improvements can be s een in various abilities, even in cases of severe dementia [e.g., (139)], but it has been suggested that the focus of the studies needs to be expanded. Specifically, most devices are used to improve ability to undertake tasks, with less attention paid to q uality of life, behavioural issues, social connectedness, and recreational", "activities (138, 139). It has been argued that assistive technologies should be used in PwD to foster social engagement and decision making, which have an important impact on person hood in dementia (140).", "Crete -Nishihata et al. investigated directly the influence of technology on the sense of self of PwD (130). Their study explored the impact of personal memory Technologies (e.g., multimedia biographies, photos, and home movies) on autobiographical memory retrieval in PwD and mild cognitive impairment. Overall, results showed that these external supports enhanced retrieval of personal past events. Findings also highlighted that the interventions using external sources as memory trigg ers improved participants’ sense of self and reduced apathy (130).", "Further evidence from extended self -processes in dementia comes from the literature on awareness of cognitive changes. Cross -cultural studies have explored the role of values and contextua l factors in self -appraisal of ability, tapping into community and group levels of the extended self (134). Mograbi et al. showed that PwD in India have lower awareness of their memory problems (141), with a further study suggesting that their relatives al so are unaware of difficulties (142). This is line with previous investigations indicating that in this region, dementia and its symptoms are less often understood as a health problem, being more likely to be considered a normal effect of aging by PwD and their caregivers alike (143, 144). This reinforces the notion that the meaning attributed to aging based on external sources (e.g., culture) influences how people are reflecting about themselves, which can be considered a form of extended self.", "Emergent Self Despite our efforts in categorizing different aspects of the self in dementia, caution should be taken to avoid reifying concepts. There are no selves inside our bodies as things, but rather a variety of processes, caused and constrained by influenci ng factors ranging from the physiological to the cultural. “Self” is the result of these processes and factors. Within this framework, an important perspective to understand this notion is emergence. The concept of emergence is based on connectionist mode ls, suggesting that local interactions may lead to properties, states, or processes with a higher level of complexity, to which an identity above and beyond its constituents must be attributed (9). A key notion here is that an emergent feature is greater t han the sum of its parts. This theoretical", "perspective may be particularly relevant to understand processes defined by their binding properties, such as consciousness (145), or, in our case, the self.", "In this sense, the emergent self can be understood as a set of unified experiences, which produce higher -order self -properties, including holistic phenomenological experiences [see (17) for an example of how intrinsic brain activity may lead to self -agency. In summary, the “self” may be based on different neu ral, cognitive, and social processes; but instead of being perceived in a fragmentary manner, it is experienced as a unitary phenomenon. A key question in relation to dementia is how this unitary experience is created and which features of the forms of sel f previously discussed contribute to this. According to our framework, selfhood in dementia (and elsewhere) emerges from a number of crucial processes. The embodied self establishes that at our core we are bodies, highlighting the role of bodily experience s and going beyond views of the self that privilege only cognitive or brain processes. The agentic self indicates that this body is driven by action, assuming responsibility for its acts in the environment. The implicit self suggests this body that acts is marked by affective preferences and behavioural responses that may be unknown to us. At a declarative level, the critical self reminds us that this body that acts and has preferences also has a history, possessing a core identity that remains despite brai n damage, while the surrogate self reflects the notion that part of our self-knowledge is constructed in interaction with others. The extended self expands the notion of selfhood beyond ourselves; we are also in the external world, in the objects and peopl e that constitute our living environment.", "It is from these vital sources that a unified sense of self emerges in PwD. Given the richness of these different self -processes, it is clear that overall this is maintained in dementia, even in later stages of the condition. This topic is of considerable clinical relevance, suggesting that when some processes are impaired, others may compensate for their absence, in a self -regulating system. Similarly, disruption of different aspects of the self may interact to produce emergent properties that characterize the experiences of a PwD. Furthermore, external sources, such as the surrogate and extended selves, that constitute the emergent self in dementia highlight our collective responsibility in supporting selfhood externally when neurodegenerative processes ha ve diminished internal sources of selfhood.", "Table 1 summarizes the seven forms of the self, as discussed in the review, while Figure 1 illustrates the emergent self in dementia.", "Table 1.

The emergent self is the result of these multiple interactions, providing a unifying context for experience and al lowing for some self -processes to compensate for impairments in others.", "CONCLUDING REMARKS The framework used in this paper develops the notion of seven aspects of the self that are pertinent to understanding PwD. These provide a framework that can be incorporated into a model of the self, the Components of the Self Model (CoSM), as shown in Fig ure 1. Here, the critical, surrogate, and implicit selves are seen as primarily neurocognitive, regulated by the agentic self. These aspects of the self are embodied, including corporealization, and extended though interaction into the environment, produci ng the emergent self.", "The framework and model, as proposed in the current article, may have important implications in terms of clinical management of PwD, also highlighting interesting avenues for future research. For example, considering the role of the body and embodied practices on the self in PwD broadens our horizons in relation to how the condition is", "represented and experienced. Embodiment allows us to understand the continuity of the self in dementia beyond cognitive impairment, also providing us w ith a new perspective on caretaking and services. In this view, the body is seen as capable of experiencing and communicating wishes and desires, even in cases of compromised verbal ability (146) and cognitive decline (20, 147 –149). The embodied self idea implies that every person with dementia is an individual who expresses themselves with and through a body, affirming the need for person -centered perspectives supportive of personhood in dementia In relation to the agentic self, excessive focus on se lfreflectiveness may have led to the notion of diminished agency in PwD, which have important implications in care for the condition, including in how clinical decision making is allowed and supported. Empowering PwD in relation to their sense of agency is an important treatment direction, fostering their ability to express preferences, take action, and assume responsibility. Here, is important to highlight the crucial role of training caregivers on assisted autonomy, allowing them to distinguish the differ ent stages of dementia and accurately acknowledge PwD functional level (57). This includes formal training to family member to support activity engagement for PwD at home (58). Additionally, future research should explore the sense of agency in dementia us ing alternative assessment methods, such as those engaging directly with individual intersubjectivity (56) and exploring personal meanings The notion of an implicit self impacts the assessment and rehabilitation in dementia. Increasing evidence sugg ests that implicit processes are more complex in nature than previously thought (62), indicating the need to consider this dimension in the interaction with PwD. According to this perspective, implicit awareness may extend to complex stimuli, for example, in the case of social judgments and decision making (62), impacting everyday life of PwD. From a clinical perspective, considering assessment, this highlights how tailoring it may prevent excessive negative emotional responses or exposure to experiences th at may be aversive in nature. Regarding rehabilitation, paradigms relying on implicit abilities may prove particularly useful for dementia (150). In both cases, paying attention to the implicit preferences, knowledge, and non -verbal behavior of PwD is part icularly important. Research priorities include testing the efficacy of these new care paradigms and understanding better long -term implicit behavioral changes in dementia.", "Findings in relation to the critical self indicate that core aspects of identity are maintained, which may support selfhood in dementia, while also pointing to potential interventions. For example, this would include use of reminiscence therapy, where indi vidualized approaches take into account the past history of a person. However, this needs to be done sensitively, balancing with the need to expose PwD to new information and associations (151). Further research into memory consolidation may elucidate whic h elements acquire hippocampal independence sooner, with neuroimaging studies helping to predict the individual profiles that may struggle with declarative aspects of identity. Future studies should also consider how autobiographical memory interacts with other forms of self - processes in dementia, for example, with implicit preferences (e.g., music) and motor habits instantiated in procedural memory (e.g., dancing).", "The presence of surrogate self -processes can be used as a therapeutic tool in dementia. For instance, exposure of self -information in a third -person perspective may be used to foster self -awareness and improve other clinical outcomes. Unawareness has been linked to risk -taking, reduced treatment compliance, and early institutionalization, in add ition to higher levels of caregiver distress and burden (152 –155), so interventions to mitigate this, if done sensitively, may have important clinical consequences. Additionally, preserved general semantic knowledge may serve as an additional source to sup port treatment decisions. For instance, the use of vignettes can be expanded in clinical settings, as a way of providing additional information and assisting in decision making. For the development of these tools, however, a better understanding of potenti al impairments of PwD in social cognition is needed, exploring in deep how perspective -taking, and related abilities, such as theory of mind and empathy, are affected in the condition. The way external objects are incorporated into self -processing needs t o be investigated further in dementia. Empirical studies demonstrated the beneficial influence of external objects in improving autobiographical memory retrieval in PwD by the use of multimedia tools (130) and external environmental stimuli (131). Although the notions behind extended cognition are routinely incorporated in neuropsychological rehabilitation, for example, in the use of compensatory strategies, future studies should explore how these external aids impact selfhood. Attention should also be paid to external sources that constitute the self in dementia, preventing unnecessary losses that may weaken self - identify (e.g., leaving their own house to reside in nursing homes) (129, 135).", "Additionally, as suggested above, the focus of current studies sho uld be expanded to other factors with a likely impact on personhood in dementia, such as social connectedness and agency (137, 138, 140). Higher levels of the extended self, linked to community and group processes, highlight the need for programs that fost er social awareness about dementia.", "Finally, the notion of an emergent self emphasizes how promoting compensation and continuity are two important directions in helping PwD retain their sense of identity. Allowing space for multiple forms of the self to ex press themselves, through bodily, agentic, implicit, and identity processes, as well as striving to compensate losses with surrogate and extended processes, is essential. Needless to say, the perspective suggested here is not that there are only seven form s of the self in dementia. On the contrary, we highlight that for each person with dementia, there are multiple sources that feed into these processes. It is from the combination of these multiple selves, and others beyond, that the uniqueness of each indi vidual emerges, facilitating a person -centered approach.", "AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS IB, EB, RM, and DM contributed writing and revising the manuscript.

Specifically, we aimed to describe how the cognitive, behavioural and affective apathy dimensions manifest in PwAD and investig ate predictive validity of the AES, an instrument used to assess apathy in this population. Furthermore, this work investigated the influence of implicit awareness processes in long -term behavioural changes. Finally, we discuss different aspects of the self in the form of seven self -processes, including their interaction with each other, their influence on the experience of living with dementia and the possible relationship between self-processes and apathy.", "The first study is a systematic review in which apathy was contemplated as a multidimensional syndrome being explored in relation to different aspects, including prevalence, clinical variables and neural correlates in PwAD. Behavioural apathy was the most prevalent dimension in PwAD, a pattern that is similar among amnestic MCI and is considered a risk factor for conversion to AD (ROBERT et al., 2002; ROBERT et al., 2006). Behavioural apathy in patients was associated with decreases in decision -making abilities and related to activity declines in the right ACC and grey matter loss in frontal regions. Cognitive apathy was the second most prevalent dimension, associated with executive dysfunction and disturbances in dorsolateral prefrontal networks. Affective apathy represents the least prevalent form of apathy in PwAD. This dimension correlates with physical agitation and was associated with reduced capacity of ToM abilities; additionally, it was linked to reduced grey matter volume in the left insula, amygda la and cerebellum, but also to disruptions in interactions involving left frontal regions. Another important find of this review is that PwAD present reduced awareness for apathetic symptoms related to all dimensions. In brief, results are suggestive of a negative impact of apathy on the progression and clinical outcome of PwAD. One important step to better understand this issue is the exploration of the behavioural correlations of each apathy scale. Marin et al. (1991) suggests that this is one of the most important parts of the validation of an instrument, and this has never been performed for the AES specifically for PwAD. Taken the fact that this scale is widely used in dementia studies (BOYLE & MALLOY, 2003), its predictive validity devolves into a rele vant issue.", "The validation of a scale through self -report is necessary for a better understand of it in terms of discriminability between groups and disorders, and convergent validity between distinct versions of an instrument (e.g., self -report, clinicia n and caregiver versions). In addition, to understand how patients are perceiving symptoms compared to their caregivers and clinicians. Nevertheless, the investigation of possible behavioural outcomes correlates is not included in this process. Supportive of these assumptions, the investigation of the predictive validity of the AES performed by Marin and colleagues (1991) found that the informant and clinician apathy ratings presented significant correlations with several of the behaviour outcome measures, all in the predicted directions. In contrast, self-ratings of the AES have shown weaker correlations with behavioural outcome measures, reflected by healthy adults rating themselves as slightly apathetic, while apathetic subjects tended to underestimate th e severity of their apathy. In the context of AD, as described in the first paper of this thesis, patients presented as lack of awareness of symptoms for all apathy dimensions, fact that highlights the importance of an investigation of the predictive valid ity of the AES for PwAD.", "Thereby, the second study enclosed in this work investigated the predictive validity of the AES among PwAD in two studies, exploring emotional reactivity and persistence, with results being correlated with the AES’s clinician -version. This study protocol was composed of two sessions, which will be referred to here as the first and second sessions. AES scores were first correlated to emotional reactivity in the form of a self -reported change score of emotions and recorded facial exp ressions of participants, assessed during the first session after performing a set computerised reaction time task and a memory task, which were manipulated for their level of difficulty, resulting in success or failure experiences. Further, AES scores wer e correlated to motivation and enjoyment, assessed during the first session, and persistence, which was assessed one week after participants performed the tasks for the first time. In this second session tasks were set at a medium difficulty level and part icipants could stop the tasks whenever they wanted to. Results have shown that a pathy presented no associations with self -reported change scores, but a tendency to change less after the memory success task. Further, apathy showed significant correlations w ith motivation and enjoyment in memory tasks, while the reaction time tasks associations were moderate. Moreover, apathy negatively impacted the intensity and repertoire of facial expressions, except in memory success tasks. Finally, apathy", "presented no as sociations with persistence in tasks during the second session. These results highlight that apathy negatively influenced the capacity of perceiving emotions and reduced implicit emotional reactions, indicating that apathetic patients might present less mo od alterations to failure experiences or negative emotions. Following this, we can assume that the presence of apathy impacts the capacity of implicit processing of information about performance and assimilation of information with emotional valence leadin g to emotional response and behavioural output changes. Those results are in accordance with current literature, which suggests that apathy promotes lack of emotional reactivity, impairments in emotional processing (MARIN, 1990; ROBERT et al., 2009) and di sturbances in emotional experiences (CEREJEIRA et al., 2012).", "Exploring the same sample with the same protocol as we used in study two of this work, Mograbi et al. (2012a) described that, patients presented differential reactivity to failure comparable to success tasks as controls, both in terms of self -report of emotions and facial expressions. In addition, results of the second study have shown that the presence of apathy in PwAD accessed by the AES negatively impacts emotional reactivity but does not le ad to a complete loss of ability. Those results reinforce the suggestion that other dimensions of apathy might affect patients more than affective apathy. One possibility is that behavioural apathy is the most prevalent in patients and that this dimension encompasses emotional components, which might have played a role in reducing emotional reactivity in the sample of patients. Reinforcing this assumption, Marin and colleagues (1991) suggested that the affective apathy is not dissociated from other dimensio ns, and therefore, emotional components were present in behavioural and cognitive items of the AES scale. Further, recruited patients presented mild to moderate AD, and behavioural apathy is one of the first to manifest in this population. Besides affectiv e apathy was described to become stronger with disease progression (WEI et al., 2019). Moreover, it would have been interesting to correlate each apathy dimension with the variables explored in study two to better understand their relationship. Nevertheles s, this article comprehends a secondary analysis, which was conducted on data from two previous studies, and apathy dimensions’ data were not available, only AES total scores. Another objective of this work was to investigate implicit emotional processing in terms of implicit affective learning, specifically, if experiences of failure in computer tasks may be able to promote long -term changes in behaviour in PwAD. Data collection was realised", "during the same sessions already described in study two. It is im portant here to highlight that patients performed the same tasks in both sessions, but at the second session tasks were set at medium difficulty and participants were free to choose the time they spent performing them. Our hypothesis was that experiences o f failure on tasks in the first session could lead to implicit affective learning, reflected by reduced persistence on difficult tasks compared to tasks programmed to be too easy in the first week. Contrary to our hypothesis, results pointed out no increas es or decreases in persistence linked to the performance on the previous session. However, when taking baseline awareness of performance as covariate, significant differences between tasks were found. Such differences were reflected in patients stopping th e tasks after a sequence of consecutive errors. These findings support the idea that implicit learning based on performance is impaired in PwAD; nevertheless, initial levels of awareness are able to promote adaptat ion of behaviour in patients . Further, there were no self -reported changes in motivation or enjoyment in response to task failure. Results of the third study are in line with current literature, which postulates that PwAD are able to monitor their task performance online but are unab le to retrieve information about task experiences over time (STEWART et al., 2010).", "In the context of the experiments using the computerized tasks, PwAD presented a similar pattern of self -report of emotions (i.e., motivation and enjoyment) and facial exp ressions to failure relative to success when compared to controls (Mograbi et al., 2012a). This work emphasised that apathy was related to reductions in both perception of emotions and emotional response to performance in tasks. One possible reason is that apathy might have potentialized difficulties in recognizing performance, especially in failure conditions, by attenuating the emotional content of experience . Supportive of these findings, Mograbi and Morris (2014a) reported that implicit emotional proces sing may be impacted by emotional blunting, one of the most characteristic symptoms of apathy, as its presence deprives experiences of their emotional valence, causing more difficulties for PwAD in recognizing them. As a consequence, errors will be normali zed and then ignored, as they may be taken as neutral experiences that are not connected to feelings (MORRIS & MOGRABI, 2013; MOGRABI & MORRIS, 2014a). It is important to mention here that apathy did not impact patients’ capacity to perceive emotions in se lf- report change score assessments, indicating that even though apathy has compromised", "emotional expression in patients, there exists implicit processing of failure information bypassing the negative effects of apathy in patients’ awareness of their emotio nal state. Those results reinforce the idea that the sample of patients investigated in this work presented behavioural rather than affective apathy.", "Moreover, in spite of presenting a similar pattern compared to controls of emotional reactivity to the ex perience of failure in tasks, results of the third study reported that patients were not able to promote long -term behavioural changes in terms of persistence after an experience of failure. In addition, study two highlighted that persistence was not assoc iated with apathy. Taking these findings, it can be suggested that the lack of implicit learning observed in patients was, in this case, probably not associated to deficits in emotional implicit processing (i.e., as a consequence of apathy), but with the p resence of executive anosognosia, that is linked to dysfunctions in the perception of the comparator mechanism, which functions under executive control (MOGRABI & MORRIS, 2013). This clinical presentation reflects some of the characteristic symptoms of AD, related to decreases in the capacity of evaluation of performance and difficulties in storing new personal information (MORRIS & MOGRABI, 2013). Supportive of such assumptions, in study three, initial awareness could help improving patient’s capacity in acknowledging errors and thereby provided an alternative route for error monitoring processes in PwAD. Such results are further evidence to how deeply interwoven emotional and cognitive processes are (OKON -SINGER et al., 2015). An interesting topic to be fu rther explored in this context is the relationship between explicit awareness and apathy, including its dimensions, regarding the impact of apathy in initial levels of awareness and how it might affect monitoring of current abilities in PwAD. An interestin g finding of this work is that the AES scale possibly substantially assesses behavioural apathy when compared to affective and cognitive apathy. This assumption relies on the results of study two and three (i.e., PwAD have shown affected emotional and beha vioural responses), added to the fact that patients were able to perform the computer tasks, which demanded certain preservation of cognitive abilities. Finally, studies exploring topics such as motivational disorders, explicit awareness or lack of it (i.e . anosognosia) and implicit processing in PwAD are very important as they offer a base of evidence to the development of theoretical studies proposing new insights in", "specific topics, as for example, how PwAD are experiencing illness, their sense of identi ty, how implicit and explicit regulation of behaviour and emotions and external stimuli are being processed and, finally, how those aspects impact their sense of self within the experience of living with dementia. The last article of this work aimed to investigate such aspects involved in the constitution of the sense of self and how they can be impacted by dementia. Seven forms of self were explored for this objective: an embodied self, which manifests as corporeal awareness; an agentic self, related to be ing an agent and influencing life circumstances; an implicit self, linked to non -conscious self - processing; a critical self, which defines the core of self -identity; a surrogate self, based on third -person perspective information; an extended self, includi ng external objects or existences that are incorporated into the self; and an emergent self, which represents a property of the self -processes that provides the sense of a unified self. It is important to highlight here that internal and external aspects o f the self were contemplated, as well as their interaction, in order to investigate the experience of living with dementia. Lastly, in order to illustrate how self -processes can be impacted by apathy, we will discuss this topic taking into consideration t he results of studies two and three. The implicit self, which represents implicit processes in our body that modulate our emotions and behaviours, is believed to be preserved until later stages of disease, as well as affective apathy, described as the most preserved form of apathy in PwAD. Such assumptions are supportive of an association between the manifestation of apathy dimensions and the maintenance of the self. In contrast, results of the second and third study of this work provide examples of how aff ective components of apathy might impact the implicit self as it negatively influences emotional processes in PwAD. In the second study apathy is correlated with reduced capacity of emotional reactivity, a result that reinforces the negative impact of apat hy in emotional expressivity and the capacity of patients in recognizing emotions.", "Moreover, in the first study of this thesis, the behavioural apathy dimension was reported as the most impaired when compared to cognitive and affective dimensions. Behavioural apathy was strongly associated with impaired decision -making capacity and with reduced intrinsic and external motivation involved in goal -directed behaviour (ESPOSITO et al., 2010; B AYARD et al., 2014). Both aspects are relevant for the so -called agentic self,", "which encompasses the “sense of agency”, related to the experience of controlling one’s own actions and, through them, influencing the course of external events (HAGGARD, 2017). Behavioural apathy might be affecting the agentic self in PwAD, as the literature suggests, that a combined deficit in decision making and self -reflection may result in diminished sense of agency in those patients (BOYLE, 2017). This association might be aggravated by the negative effects of apathy in relation to reductions in the emotional valence of experiences. Such effects might also negatively impact the extended self, as the attribution of value to external sources might be impaired and thus, objects and existences might not receive enough emotional meaning to be incorporated as part of the sense of self of PwAD.", "Finally, the emergent self, which is believed to depend on the sum of all self -processes, and may, therefore, be negatively impacted by all apathy dimensions. The idea of an interaction between the proposed processes of the self is interesting as some may compensate for impairment in others, in a self -regulating system. Thus, the effects of the specific apathy dimension on the self might also be mitigated by compensation. Furthermore, it is interesting to think about the fact that affective apathy is more c ommon in later stages of disease, summed to the fact that cognitive apathy was reported to be less affected than behavioural apathy in early stages, and therefore, the preservation of both might also function as a compensation mechanism for the impact of b ehavioural apathy in PwAD. Accordingly, the role of the initial levels of awareness in current behavioural regulation and implicit processing, described in article 3, are very important tools, which are retained until later stages of disease for the preser vation of selfhood in PwAD, as it enables internal and external stimuli to be processed even in cases of memory loss and the absence of explicit awareness of condition. But also, implicit awareness, reflected in the capacity of implicitly processing emotio ns, may also provide motivational basis for adaptation and emotional and behavioural regulation. In this context, such compensation mechanism becomes a clinically relevant issue, with great value for assessment and rehabilitation procedures for dementia an d other neurological conditions. Some general limitations of the present work should be acknowledged. The first one refers to the methodological heterogeneity between the studies reviewed, that did not allow for performing a meta -analysis in the first stu dy. Another limitation is that", "restricting the investigated population to PwAD instead of PwD has impacted the number of eligible articles. In study two, we focused on the effect size for the interpretation of the result of correlations between apathy, emo tional variables and persistence, since it does not depend on sample size like p -value. Thus, great care must be taken when extrapolating results. Another issue related to the generalizability of our findings is that the sample of studies two and three wer e composed of PwAD in mild to moderate stages, fact that might reduce the extrapolation of the findings to the severe AD patients. Furthermore, we were not able to distinguish between apathy dimensions in the second study as data used for analysis was extracted from a previously collected databank, in which AES results for each dimension where not available. Further studies should deeply investigate the predictive validity of multidimensional apathy instruments in PwAD , exploring different behavioural outcomes for each apathy dimension. Moreover, the main question of the third study did not allow the inclusion of a control group, as participants would remember task performance in a second session in a one -week interval, thus, implicit adaptation in this group would not be measured. In addition, the sample studied was limited, both in terms of the heterogeneity of cognitive impairments and actual size , and effect sizes obtained were small. In this context, it might be that only much larger samples would deliver significant results for the existence of implicit learning using the selected paradigms.", "CONCLUSION The findings of this work emphasize that apathy is a very relevant syndrome in the context of AD. Apathy dimensions ’ merit receiving appropriate attention, as they manifest differently, begin to affect patients in distinct stages of disease and are linked to several clinical and neural variables. Moreover, r esults support the idea of a preservation of emotional implici t processing in PwAD, supporting the model CAM ( AGNEW & MORRIS, 1998 ; MORRIS & HANNESDOTTIR, 2004; MORRIS & MOGRABI, 2013 ), which proposes a parallel rout of implicit information processing modulating emotions and behaviour. Apathy was shown to negatively impact emotional reactivity in PwAD, probably emotional components belonging to other apathy dimensions, as behavioural apathy, might have affected patient’s capacity in recognise and express emotions . One", "possible explanation is the attenuation of the emotional valence of experiences, caused by emotional blunting. In this context, the presence of apathy may differently impact aspects of the self as the prevalence and symptoms of apathy dimensions during disease course seems to be inversely associated with the preservation of specific self -processes in PwAD.", "Despite of the impacts caused by apathy on implicit awareness, as its presence reduces emotional reactivity, such processes were still preserved in mild to moderate patients, as Mograbi et al. (2012a) has described , exploring the same sample as this work. Moreover, results also highlight the role of initial levels of awareness in regulating behaviour in PwAD, as patients quit the computerized tasks after a sequence of errors, suggesting the existence of an online monitoring of performance in failure experiences. We could not show long -term behaviou ral changes in form of implicit learning in patients and suggest that executive forms of anosognosia might have negatively impacted this process, as no correlations between apathy and persistence were found.", "The contributions of this thesis are potentiall y relevant for clinical practices and caregiving , as they allow a better understanding of apathy, which is the most prevalent NPS observed in PwAD and, further, the impact of this syndrome in implicit processes, which promote emotional and behavioural regu lation. Lastly, the article exploring self - processes in PwAD allows for a better understanding of how patients are experiencing their sense of identity, how apathy might affect those and how we can support patients in retaining it.", "For conclusion, future directions will be presented. Future research exploring particular aspects within apathy dimensions could bring substantial insights (e.g., motivating patients thought implicit -processed stimuli instead of cognitive commands), reducing the consequences of apathy for patients and caregivers. In addition to the necessity of new insights about clinical and neural variables, there is a lack of evidence for the possible interactions between these different dimensions, i.e., how they interact and if there exists a chance that treating one dimension could reduce the prevalence of other or compensate for related impairments. This information is fundamental to be explored in future studies as there is an increasing interest in investigating apathy, since this syndrom e was recognized as a potential treatment target (LANCTÔT et al., 2017). Furthermore,", "considering the associations between apathy and implicit emotional processes, as it implies, among others, in reduced capacity of emotional reactivity, a better understan ding of such correlations , can instigate the development of more accurate treatments, involving the idea of reducing apathy levels in specific dimensions to benefit directly the capacity of PwAD in recognising disease -related alterations. Likewise, the rel ationship between apathy and explicit awareness might be further explored, especially in relation to how apathy may affect initial levels of awareness, and thus impact the capacity of online error monitoring and consequently the update of personal knowledg e about current abilities. In this context, a better understanding of anosognosia and its multiple aspects is essential for clarifying these associations with apathy. In addition, empirical evidence elucidating the relationship between apathy and self -processes in dementia is missing. Future directions could encompass how behavioural, cognitive and affective apathy are linked to each self -process in relation to impairments , but also the preservation of those. Such information would also promote the development of accurate diagnostic tools and tailored treatment to each individual patient’s needs. One example are interventions using external sources as memory triggers, which improved participants’ sense of self and reduced apathy (CRETE -NISHIHATA et al., 2012). In addition, improvements of both therapeutic and pharmacological interventions for apathy, anosognosia and preservation of the self might lead to increases in the quality of life of patients, delay of the neurodegenerative process in some cases and reduction of family member’s and caregiver’s distress (RITCHIE & TOU CHON, 2000) .", "Moreover, further studies are necessary for a better understanding of the role of implicit emotional processing in promoting emotional reactivity and behavioural adaptations. Relevant topics are, for example, the relationship between implic it and explicit information processing, which factors impact such adaptations and the temporal relationship between implicit awareness behavioural adaptation. In this context, authors also highlight the importance of investigations regarding the impact of disease severity on implicit awareness, since this may contribute to an understanding of how the implicit awareness system reacts as deficits increase (MARTYR et al., 2011).", "Increasing the body of evidence related to the topics explored in this thesis may represent the base knowledge needed for the development of theoretical concepts such as the seven", "selves of dementia. A work that is particularly relevant for PwAD, caregiving and solutions for dementia.", "APPENDIX APPENDIX A – Introdução Doença de Alzheimer A demência é uma síndrome de natureza crônica e progressiva, que leva a comprometimentos cognitivos e funcionais mais acentuados do que se poderia esperar das consequências naturais do envelhecimento (WHO, 2018) . Segundo a Organização Mundial da Saúde (OMS), cerca de 55 milhões de pessoas sofrem de demê ncia atualmente no mundo, sendo que destas, mais de 70% vivem em países de média e baixa renda, como o Brasil (WHO, 2021). Com o aumento e envelhecimento da população mundial, estimativas sugerem que, em 2030, mais de 78 milhões de pessoas desenvolverão qu adros demenciais e esse número chegará a 139 milhões em 2050 , levando em consideração que o envelhecimento representa um dos principais fatores de risco para o desenvolvimento da demência (PIACERI et al., 2013, PRINCE et al., 2016) . Quadros demenciais são a sétima causa de morte entre todas as doenças e a principal causa de incapacidade e dependência entre os idosos no mundo ( DUBOIS et al., 2010; MOGRABI e MORRIS, 2018). Somado a isso, a demência vem acompanhada de um imenso impacto social e econômico, com o seu fardo impactando sistemas de saúde e previdenciários, além de efeitos deletérios em cuidadores (WHO, 2021; FERRETTI et al., 2018). Considerando as consequências econômicas e sociais da demência, juntamente com a sua contribuição para a dependência e incapacidade, esta destaca -se como uma das prioridades da saúde pública do século XXI.", "A Doença de Alzheimer (DA) é uma das formas mais comuns de demência entre idosos, contribuindo com cerca de 60 a 80% dos casos (ANAND, et al., 2014; BUCKNER et al., 2005 ; SALMON et al., 2005). Os principais fatores de risco para DA são idade avançada, histórico familiar positivo, sexo feminino, depressão prévia, diabetes mellitus, hiperlipidemia, fatores vasculares e traumatismo craniano (KIVIPELTO et al., 2005). Embora a literatura científica tenda a relacionar o processo neurodegenerativo da DA com o acúmulo de proteína β amilóide e TAU anormalmente dobradas em placas amilóides e emaranhados neuronais, ainda pouco se sabe sobre a causa da doença (SCHELTENS et", "Estudos sugerem que a DA pode afetar múltiplos aspectos da cognição e comportamento (WEINTRAUB e WICKLUND, 2012), sendo caracterizada por sintomas cognitivos e não cognitivos relacionados à atrofia cerebral (NELSON et al., 2012; SCHELTENS et al., 2016). L evando em consideração o diagnóstico de DA, um conjunto de critérios como os contidos no Manual Diagnóstico e Estatístico de Transtornos Mentais (DSM -5) (APA, 2013) são avaliados. Estes incluem prejuízos significativos em um ou mais domínios cognitivos: aprendizagem, memória, linguagem, funções executivas, atenção complexa, habilidade perceptivo -motora e cognição social. Além disso, esses déficits devem i ncluir um prejuízo significativo no funcionamento social ou ocupacional e constituir uma mudança em relação a um nível de desempenho anterior (KNOPMAN et al., 2001; PETERSEN e MORRIS, 2005, APA, 2013). Segundo os critérios do DSM -5, os déficits cognitivos não devem ser explicados por outro transtorno mental ou no contexto de um delírio. A DA também está associada a uma série de dificuldades no processamento de informações pessoais, envolvidas na atualização do autoconhecimento (FEINBERG, 2011; MORRIS e MOGR ABI, 2013). Ademais, pesquisas recentes descrevem que domínios emocionais podem ser afetados, sendo que este tipo de comprometimento pode ocorrer antes mesmo da manifestação dos sintomas cognitivos (FREDERICKS et al., Além dos sintomas cognitivos e comportamentais, a DA é caracterizada por sintomas neuropsiquiátricos (NPS) (NPS do inglês neuropsychiatric symptoms, DIETLIN et al., 2019; LYKETSOS, 2015; STEINBERG et al., 2008). Estes foram associados a sobrecarga do cuidador, institucionalização precoc e (LANCTÔT et al., 2017), pior prognóstico da doença e morte (PETERS et al., 2015). A apatia é descrita como o NPS mais frequente em PcDA (PcDA) (MEGA et al., 1996; LYKETSOS, 2015; SIAFARIKAS et al., 2017; STARKSTEIN et al., 2006; ZHAO et al., 2016), segui do por depressão, agressividade, ansiedade e distúrbios do sono, entre outros (ZHAO et al., 2016). A presença de apatia foi sugerida como a principal causa de sofrimento em PcDA e o principal motivo de institucionalização entre os pacientes (TUN et al., 20 07; BEINOT et al., 2008). Além disso, pacientes apáticos foram considerados mais suscetíveis a todos os NPS associados à DA (BEINOT et al., 2008). Ademais, a apatia tem sido apontada como fator preditivo de aumento da mortalidade em pacientes com DA (VILAL TA-", "FRANCH et al., 2012; SPALLETTA et al., 2015). Assim, esta síndrome representa uma questão relevante no contexto da DA, pois reflete um possível potencializador, que aumenta o grau de comprometimentos dos pacientes e constitui uma significativa fonte de estresse para os cuidadores, além de ter sido relacionada como causa substancial de aumento dos custos de saúde devido à institucionalização precoce (AGÜERA -ORTIZ1", "Apatia na Doença de Alzheimer A apatia pode ser definida como uma síndrome q ue envolve sintomas comportamentais, cognitivos e afetivos, incluindo perda de iniciativa, falta de interesse em executar atividades orientadas para objetivos e embotamento afetivo (MARIN et al. 1991; STUSS et al., 2000; LEVY e DUBOIS, 2006; MULIN et al., 2011). Em uma revisão sistemática e metanálise realizada por Zhao e colaboradores (2016), incluindo 25 artigos entre 1964 e 2014, os autores descreveram uma prevalência de apatia de 49% em PcDA. Sendo que uma notável diferença foi observada na prevalência, traduzida em uma variação de 19% a 88% entre os estudos. Esta variação já foi descrita em outras revisões como, por exemplo, LANDES et al., 2001 e STARKSTEIN et al., 2006. A heterogeneidade entre os estudos pode ser reflexo de diferentes métodos de avalia ção e níveis de severidade da doença (LANDES et al., 2001; ZHAO et al., 2016), mas também divergência entre o nível educacional e cognitivo dos pacientes (ZHAO et al., 2016). Apesar de evidências sugerirem uma maior prevalência de apatia em estágios mais a vançados da doença (LANDES et al., 2005; STARKSTEIN et al., 2006), autores relatam uma prevalência significativa mesmo em estágios leves e moderados (BEINOT et al., 2008), com tendências de aumento consequentes da progressão da doença (LANDES et al., 2001) . A apatia na demência é geralmente avaliada por meio de entrevistas clínicas (por exemplo, a Escala de Avaliação de Apatia, AES do inglês Apathy Evaluation Scale; MARIN et al., 1991), na forma de questionários de informantes ou de autorrelato de pacientes (para uma revisão dos métodos de avaliação, veja BOYLE e MALLOY, 2003).", "É importante distinguir entre apatia e depressão em pacientes com demência. Embora a apatia e a depressão sejam frequentemente concomitantes (STARKSTEIN et al., 2001) e", "caracterizadas por distúrbios na experiência emocional, elas podem ser consideradas como condições clínicas distintas e que podem ocorrer de forma independente (CEREJEIRA et al., 2012). A apatia é conhecida como um transtorno motivacional, definido principalmente pela f alta de reatividade emocional, perda de iniciativa e participação em comportamentos direcionados a objetivos, tarefas que dependem da cognição e processamento emocional (MARIN, 1990; ROBERT et al., 2009). A apatia é entendida como um construto envolvendo t rês dimensões (ou seja, cognitiva, comportamental e afetiva). A primeira envolve processos de disfunção cognitiva e, por consequência, comprometimentos nos planos de ações visando a antecipação do comportamento. A segunda dimensão engloba a incapacidade de gerar comportamentos externos e inclui dificuldades na ativação voluntária de pensamentos e iniciação de ações voluntárias. Por fim, a dimensão afetiva envolve a dificuldade na atribuição de informações afetivas e emocionais na antecipação do comportament o (MARIN, 1991; LEVY E DUBOIS, 2006). A apatia é comumente descrita como uma síndrome independente, uma vez que nenhum fator secundário, como, por exemplo, sofrimento emocional, diminuição do nível de consciência ou comprometimento cognitivo, tem como cons equência a característica perda de motivação observada em pacientes apáticos (LEVY e DUBOIS, 2006; MARIN et al., 1991). Embora a falta de motivação possa ocorrer tanto na apatia quanto na depressão (MULIN et al., 2011), a apatia é marcada pela falta de mot ivação sem alternância de estados de humor ou disforia (CEREJEIRA et al., 2012). Evidências provindas de estudos de neuroimagem também apoiam as distinções entre apatia e depressão em PcDA, sugerindo que os correlatos neurobiológicos da apatia são distinto s e independentes daqueles envolvidos na depressão (ver RAIMO et al., 2019). No contexto da DA, existe uma extensiva correlação descrita na literatura relacionando a apatia com uma diminuição no volume da substância cinzenta em várias áreas corticais e subcorticais, particularmente os córtices frontal medial, orbitofrontal lateral e pré -frontal ventrolateral, os gânglios da base, bem como o córtex cingulado anterior (ACC) (APOSTOLOVA et al., 2007; BRUEN et al., 2008; ROSEN et al., 2005; TUNNARD et Embora vários estudos tenham sido produzidos com o objetivo de compreender melhor a apatia no contexto da DA, ainda há carência de informações sobre como as diferentes", "dimensões da apatia se manifestam em PcDA. Além disso, ainda falta a validade prediti va, que reflete o grau com que o resultado de um teste prevê o comportamento futuro do indivíduo e foi indicada como o aspecto mais importante da validação de escalas (CUNNINGHAM, 1986; MARIN et al., 1991), de instrumentos amplamente utilizados para acessa r apatia em PcDA. Este é o caso, por exemplo, da AES (MARIN et al., 1991), uma escala amplamente utilizada em estudos envolvendo pacientes com demência (BOYLE e MALLOY, 2003), que teve sua validade preditiva investigada em adultos saudáveis e um grupo comp osto por paciente neurológicos e psiquiátricos, mas não exclusivamente em PcDA.", "O Self na demência Apesar da falta de uma definição consistente, a ideia de self é muito importante para a compreensão de nossas experiências cotidianas e da experiência de vi ver com um transtorno psiquiátrico ou neurológico, pois assumimos uma perspectiva de primeira pessoa para acessar os acontecimentos do mundo em nossa vida cotidiana. William James sugeriu que para a existência de sentimentos e pensamentos é essencial que h aja um experienciador, caso contrário não haveria experiência (JAMES, 1950), fenômeno conhecido como ontologia de primeira pessoa (SEARLE, 2007). O self, nesse contexto, é entendido como uma propriedade inerente que modula nossa perspectiva subjetiva na apreensão do nosso mundo.", "Alguns autores têm apontado uma série de distúrbios neuropsicológicos envolvendo o self que se caracterizam por estados em que os pacientes apresentam alterações em seu senso de identidade ou nas relações pessoais entre o mundo exte rno e o self (FEINBERG, 2011). Nesse contexto, cada processo de self, quando afetado, pode comprometer diferentes aspectos. Como, por exemplo, processos de self relacionados a fontes externas de informação podem impactar negativamente a maneira como os ind ivíduos interagem com objetos e pessoas. E podem, também, levar a alterações do self em relação ao significado atribuído ao mundo à volta (FEINBERG, 2011).", "Exemplos de tais patologias que podem alterar o self são a demência, o autismo, a esquizofrenia e as síndromes de falsa identificação delirante. Estas patologias podem", "afetar diferentes domínios do self como, por exemplo, disfunções caracterizadas por uma perda de sentido da natureza ou limites do próprio corpo, além de alterações na forma como o indivíduo descreve experiências presentes e passadas (FEINBERG, 2011). Tais alterações nas experiências pessoais causadas por condições neurológicas e psiquiátrica s constituem mais uma evidência para o construto de self, pois as distintas alterações na experiência, podem refletir uma possível divergência nas vias neuronais subjacentes a esse fenômeno. Em conformidade com esta visão do self, este trabalho se refere a ele como ¨processos de self¨ ou ¨aspectos do self¨, evitando a interpretação do self como algo que existe dentro da nossa mente; ou seja, resguardando assim pensar sobre o self como uma função particular, que pode ser atribuída funcionalmente a alguma reg ião específica do nosso cérebro. Assim, a experiência do self pode ser entendida como uma interação de processos, representando diferentes aspectos dele, envolvendo redes neurais distintas que constantemente trocam informações com o ambiente externo e estã o sob influência de valores interpessoais e fatores culturais (MOGRABI et al., 2009). Além disso, esta multiplicidade de processos de self pode estabelecer uma relação hierárquica, uma vez que a literatura sugere que processos de self de ordem superior dep endem de informações produzidas por outros mais básicos, mais essenciais (FEINBERG et al., 2005). Explorar os diferentes processos de self é muito relevante no contexto da DA, pois a demência pode impactar de forma diferente cada um deles. De fato, a DA é uma condição neurodegenerativa, na qual os pacientes já em estágios iniciais sofrem de declínio cognitivo, como comprometimento da memória (WEINTRAUB e WICKLUND, 2012; NELSON et al., 2012; SCHELTENS et al., 2016; PRINCE et al., 2016). Considerando a relaçã o entre o self e a memória de acordo com a perspectiva das perdas mnemônicas e da redução da capacidade de atualização do autoconhecimento, as PcDA limitam -se a informações pessoais desatualizadas para constituir seu senso de self. Outro exemplo que destac a o impacto da demência na experiência do self em PcDA está relacionado a processos implícitos, que estão modulando a reatividade emocional e o comportamento dos pacientes mesmo na ausência de consciência explícita, promovendo a atualização do autoconhecim ento. Seguindo essa linha de pensamento, evidências acumuladas na literatura sustentam a ideia da existência de diversos processos de self em PcDA. Compreender quais aspectos do self podem estar preservados durante os diferentes", "estágios da doença e quais são mais vulneráveis é essencial para a oferta do cuidado adequado e promoção da saúde do paciente e sua família. Tal conhecimento também subsidia a utilização de práticas de cuidado mais humanizadas, que envolvam a conservação dos aspectos do self mais pr eservados e estimulação daqueles que estão comprometidos.", "Anosognosia na Doença de Alzheimer O conceito de autoconsciência pode ser descrito como a capacidade de se tornar objeto de sua própria consciência (MORIN, 2011) e é um aspecto crucial que permite que os indivíduos funcionem adequadamente na vida cotidiana, reconhecendo limites e escolhendo com precisão as atividades de acordo com suas habilidades (ROSEN et al., 2010). A autoconsciência pode ser expressa explicitamente na forma de autorrelatos ou de forma mais implícita, por meio do comportamento. Há uma hierarquia envolvendo a autoconsciência que incorpora diferentes tipos de processos emocionais e cognitivos, como estímulos sensoriais e perceptivos, mas também funções cognitivas de ordem superior. Níveis complexos de autoconsciência envolvem a capacidade de monitorar com precisão e de forma permanente o desempenho e/ou experiências (MORRIS e HANNESDOTTIR, 2004). Um aspecto fundamental para a autoconsciência é a metacognição, que se refere à avaliaçã o de pensamentos, sentimentos e representações perceptivas (MOGRABI et al., 2021).", "No contexto das doenças neurológicas, anosognosia ou falta de consciência da doença são os termos utilizados para denominar a falta de consciência de ter um transtorno ou comprometimento (MOGRABI e MORRIS, 2018). A anosognosia se manifesta em diferentes níveis, que vão desde uma completa falta de consciência da condição, em que os pacientes negam a presença de uma doença específica, até formas mais brandas. Nas formas leves, os pacientes apresentam dificuldades em reconhecer alterações relacionadas a condição em domínios específicos, incluindo por exemplo disfunções cognitivas, sensoriais, motoras e comportamentais, além de incapacidades nas habilidades sociais e no funcioname nto cotidiano, mas também alterações de personalidade (JACUS, 2017; MOGRABI et al., 2018). A consciência da doença em pessoas com demência (PcD) é", "frequentemente avaliada através da comparação do autorrelato dos pacientes com o relato do médico/cuidador. N o entanto, medidas quantitativas podem ser usadas para acessar a consciência da doença e posteriormente comparadas com o autorrelato. Um exemplo é o desempenho real em tarefas comparado a julgamentos avaliativos de performance (CLARE et al., 2005). A anoso gnosia é uma das características centrais da DA e pode ser considerada uma consequência da progressão da doença (HANNESDOTTIR e MORRIS, 2007). Existe uma grande variação nas estimativas de prevalência desse fenômeno entre os estudos (variando de 23 a 81%) (MOGRABI et al., 2012c; SOUSA et al., 2015). No entanto, estudos com grandes amostras relatam consistentemente uma prevalência acima de 30% em PcDA (STARKSTEIN et al., 2007). Um exemplo é o estudo epidemiológico conduzido por Mograbi et al. (2012c), inclui ndo 897 pacientes, que reportou que cerca de 78% dos mesmos desconheciam seus déficits mnemônicos.", "Em complemento, a anosognosia tem implicações importantes para pacientes e cuidadores como, por exemplo, a redução da adesão ao tratamento (PATEL e PRINCE, 2001; STARKSTEIN et al., 2007), possui um papel na segurança dos pacientes, já que sua presença está relacionada à exposição deles a situações de risco como dirigir (HURT et al., 2010, PATEL e PRINCE, 2001; STARKSTEIN et al., 2007). Ademais, está associada à institucionalização precoce (HORNING et al., 2014). Além disso, a anosognosia também foi apontada como fator agravante de sobrecarga dos cuidadores (SELTZER et al., 1997).", "No contexto da DA, a anosognosia já foi associada a diferentes mecanismos. Exemplo s destes são: falhas no processamento de monitoramento e controle (SOUCHAY, 2007), efeitos da desregulação emocional relacionados ao automonitoramento, capacidade prejudicada para consolidação de novas informações pessoais (MORRIS e MOGRABI, 2013) e reduçã o na capacidade de tomada de decisão (MORRIS e MOGRABI, 2013). Para mais, a literatura sugere que a anosognosia na DA pode ser causada por declínios em específicos tipos de memória, que podem levar a diminuição na capacidade de atualização de autoconhecime nto. Processo esse que ocorre devido à falta de atualização de conhecimento pessoal em relação ao desempenho em tarefas e habilidades pessoais por meio de julgamentos avaliativos de performance (MOGRABI et al., 2009, LENZONI", "Seguindo o model o teórico conhecido como Cognitive Awareness Model (CAM, AGNEW e MORRIS, 1998; MORRIS e HANNESDOTTIR, 2004; MORRIS e MOGRABI, 2013), a anosognosia é considerada um fenômeno heterogêneo. Em decorrência de danos de origem mais estrutural, uma forma executiva de anosognosia se expressa, porém também existem formas mnemônicas de anosognosia. No contexto da DA, a anosognosia está principalmente relacionada a comprometimentos de memória, ou seja, anosognosia mnemônica. Considerando o modelo CAM, as informações sã o consolidadas e atualizadas em um banco de armazenamento de informações pessoais, também chamado de Base de Dados Pessoais. Normalmente, esta base de dados é continuamente atualizada após uma experiência. Isso ocorre à medida que alterações nas habilidade s pessoais são detectadas e comparadas às informações armazenadas por um mecanismo comparador, chamado Mecanismo Comparador Cognitivo. Um Sistema de Consciência Metacognitiva libera as informações no caso da existência de divergências entre os dados refere ntes às habilidades vigentes armazenadas no banco de dados pessoais e o desempenho atual. Este processo de detecção de alterações de habilidades pessoais pelo mecanismo comparador, seguido pelo reconhecimento das mesmas pelo sistema metacognitivo, fornece informações para a consolidação de autoconhecimento atualizado, permitindo o desenvolvimento, por exemplo, de um senso de consciência de fracasso em casos de desempenho abaixo do esperado. Nesse modelo, a anosognosia é vista como uma disfunção multifatoria l. O CAM é um modelo baseado na hipótese de que a anosognosia na DA é principalmente uma consequência da perda mnemônica, especialmente relacionada à consolidação de memória autobiográfica episódica, que representa o conhecimento sobre si mesmo, incluindo memórias de eventos e experiências pessoais significativas (CONWAY, 2005). Sendo assim, este prejuízo na atualização de informações pessoais faz com que o banco de dados permaneça preenchido com autoconhecimento desatualizado nas PcDA (MOGRABI et al., 2009 ; MOGRABI e MORRIS, 2013; LENZONI et al., 2020). O modelo também aponta para o papel da disfunção executiva como possível causa para anosognosia, acarretando a chamada anosognosia executiva. Forma de anosognosia que está relacionada ao mal funcionamento do s mecanismos de comparação que dependem de funções executivas para operar apropriadamente detectando divergências entre habilidades pessoais armazenadas e atuais. Tais déficits impactam na capacidade de atualização de", "informações pessoais atreladas à doenç a, como a condição em si, porém também comprometimentos decorrentes dela (MORRIS e MOGRABI , 2013).", "Os NPS também foram associados a níveis reduzidos de consciência da doença (VOGEL et al., 2006), particularmente a apatia (DEROUESNE et al., 1999). Devido ao fato de a apatia ter sido recorrentemente relacionada a anosognosia na literatura científica, alguns estudos exploraram a relação entre os níveis de consciência da doença e apatia em PcDA. Resultados sugerem que a anosognosia acentuada está relacionada a altos níveis de apatia (por exemplo, DEROUESNE et al., 1999, STARKSTEIN et al., 2001). Em contrapartida, a presença de anosognosia foi apontada como um fator preditor de apatia em estágios mais avançados da doença (STARKSTEIN et al., 2001). Em concordância , um correlato neuroanatômico em comum foi sugerido para apatia e anosognosia na DA (OTT et al., 1996). Estudos de neuroimagem apontam que ambas estão relacionadas a disfunções no lobo frontal (ver MARIN, 1991; MARSHALL et al., 2006; MARSHALL et al., 2007; LANCTÔT et al., 2017; APOSTOLOVA et al., 2007 para apatia e AMANZIO et al., 2011; HARWOOD et al., 2005 para anosognosia). Além disso, Raimo et al. (2019), em um estudo de meta -análise, destacou que a apatia pode ser consequência de disfunções em regiões e nvolvidas no processamento executivo (i.e., áreas frontais) e regulação emocional (e.g., áreas cinguladas e sistema de recompensa). Do mesmo modo, a anosognosia na DA foi associada a comprometimento das funções executivas (MANGONE et al., 1991; MICHON et a l., 1994). Uma investigação mais detalhada da associação entre apatia e anosognosia é fundamental para uma melhor compreensão de como esses fenômenos podem estar relacionados.", "Processos implícitos na doença de Alzheimer Há um corpo substancial de evidênci as clínicas e experimentais demonstrando que nosso comportamento e emoções são afetados pelo processamento de informações implícitas e que esse fenômeno é preservado em uma variedade de condições neurológicas (para uma revisão ver MOGRABI E MORRIS, 2013). As PcDA geralmente não possuem consciência sobre sua doença, déficits cognitivos ou alterações no desempenho neuropsicológico (MOGRABI et al, 2012a; ROSEN, 2011; STARKSTEIN et al, 2007).", "Weinstein (1991) sugeriu que, embora as PcDA possam não apresentar co nsciência explícita, elas ajustam seus comportamentos e atividades de acordo com as necessidades decorrentes da condição atual e comprometimentos decorrentes da mesma (WEINSTEIN, 1991). Mograbi e Morris (2013) complementarmente relataram com base em observ ações clínicas que a falta de consciência da doença paradoxalmente pode ser acompanhada por sinais de compreensão ou representações de comprometimentos, que não são expressos explicitamente. Sendo assim, alguns processos implícitos podem promover uma espéc ie de ajuste emocional e comportamental nas alterações neuropsicológicas e este processo pode ocorrer sem recuperação consciente de informação. Este cenário retrata a existência de conhecimento implícito em pessoas com demência. Vários estudos já investiga ram a regulação da resposta comportamental e emocional por meio de processos implícitos em PcDA (ver para detalhes MOGRABI e MORRIS, 2013). Cotrell e Wild (1999), por exemplo, elucidaram que PcDA implementam restrições voluntárias nos hábitos de direção em resposta aos comprometimentos provindos da DA, porém não atribuem estas mudanças nos hábitos aos déficits cognitivos, às alterações funcionais ou à condição em si. Um outro exemplo vem do estudo de Drachman e Swearer (1933), onde os autores sugerem que Pc DA foram capazes de adaptar seu comportamento em relação aos hábitos de direção por meio do processamento implícito de informações referentes às experiências de fracasso. Entre estas mudanças, foram observados comportamentos como redução das distâncias per corridas e restrição da direção a ambientes familiares (DRACHMAN e SWEARER, 1993).", "Outro exemplo de tais ajustes é o efeito das emoções no comportamento que opera em um nível de processamento automático e não consciente (MOGG et al., 1993; OHMAN et al., 2 001). Este efeito foi observado em estudos investigando a reatividade emocional a palavras relacionadas à memória em um experimento utilizando uma adaptação do Teste de Stroop (Martyr et al, 2011). Neste estudo, os pesquisadores tiveram como objetivo deter minar se pessoas em estágio inicial de demência e seus cuidadores apresentam viés de processamento emocional de palavras relacionadas à demência em um paradigma emocional do Stroop. Os autores relataram que ambos, PcDA e cuidadores, apresentaram o mesmo ní vel de aumento nos tempos de resposta para palavras salientes em comparação com palavras neutras. Além disso, nos pacientes esse efeito não estava relacionado aos", "seus níveis explícitos de consciência da doença, o que indica uma interferência emocional a nível implícito, modulando o comportamento (MARTYR et al., 2011).", "Um estudo explorando a reatividade emocional à material de vídeo fornece mais evidências para a existência de processamento emocional implícito em PcDA. Neste experimento, os pacientes foram expostos a um conjunto de vídeos que continham diferentes estímulos, incluindo materiais neutros, negativos e positivos. Os vídeos com material de conteúdo negativo tratavam de temas relacionados à demência ou pacientes lidando com câncer. Apesar dos pacie ntes com DA apresentarem reatividade emocional acessada através de autorrelato, discretamente reduzida após assistirem os vídeos de conteúdo negativo em comparação aos participantes do grupo controle, eles manifestaram um padrão de expressões faciais semel hante aos controles em resposta a todos os vídeos (MOGRABI et al., 2012b). Essa ideia também foi explorada experimentalmente em um estudo (MOGRABI et al, 2012a) que investigou a reatividade emocional em resposta a performance em tarefas computadorizadas de tempo de reação e memória manipuladas em relação aos níveis de dificuldade para condições de sucesso e fracasso. A hipótese explorada foi a de que havendo algum nível de reconhecimento implícito da experiência de fracasso, a resposta emocional deveria ser relativamente preservada. Os resultados indicaram que, apesar das PcDA apresentarem menores níveis de consciência explícita da performance nas tarefas após experiências de fracasso em relação aos controles, a reatividade emocional foi preservada, tanto em termos de autorrelato quanto de expressões faciais, com maior reatividade ao fracasso em comparação ao sucesso. Esses resultados enfatizam a existência de processamento emocional implícito, embasado no fato de que a reatividade emocional se mostrou congru ente à experiência de fracasso. Aqui é importante enfatizar que o processamento emocional implícito de informações relacionadas a performance ocorreu mesmo que os pacientes não apresentassem conhecimento explícito do seu desempenho real da tarefa.", "Além dis so, o processamento emocional implícito não regula apenas o comportamento atual, mas também pode ser capaz de promover aumentos na consciência explícita. Esses dados são consistentes com o CAM (AGNEW e MORRIS, 1998; MORRIS e HANNESDOTTIR, 2004; MORRIS e MO GRABI, 2013). Como o modelo postula que a presença de mecanismos relativamente bem preservados para detecção de erros permite", "que informações sobre comprometimentos ou condição sejam processadas por uma rota implícita paralela que contorna a consciência, o resultado é a regulação emocional e comportamental que ocorre mesmo na ausência de metacognição (MOGRABI et al., 2009). Em resumo, as formas implícitas de processamento de informações são capazes de regular a reatividade emocional e o comportamento atual e, adicionalmente, podem estar ligadas a ganhos de consciência explícita. Essas são características muito interessantes, no entanto, ainda há questões em aberto sobre o papel do processamento emocional implícito na promoção de mudanças comportamentais de l ongo prazo em PcDA.", "APPENDIX B – Conclusão Conclusão Os achados deste trabalho enfatizam que a apatia é uma síndrome muito relevante no contexto da DA. Para mais, futuros estudos deveriam explorar as dimensões da apatia, pois elas se manifestam de forma distinta e em diferentes estágios da doença. Além disso, se relacionam com variáveis clínicas e neurais. Os resultados desta tese respaldam a ideia de preservação de processamento implícito em PcDA, de acordo com o modelo CAM (AGNEW e M ORRIS, 1998; MORRIS e HANNESDOTTIR, 2004; MORRIS e MOGRABI, 2013), que propõe uma rota paralela de processamento de informações capaz de modular as emoções e o comportamento. Os resultados desta tese enfatizaram o impacto negativo da apatia na reatividade emocional de pessoas com DA, provavelmente através de componentes emocionais pertencentes à apatia comportamental, que promovem uma diminuição na capacidade de reconhecer e manifestar emoções. Uma possível explicação é a atenuação da valência emocional das experiências, causada pelo embotamento emocional. Dentro deste contexto, a presença de apatia pode impactar os processos do self de forma diferente, pois a prevalência e os sintomas das dimensões da apatia durante o curso da doença parecem estar inversame nte associados à preservação de processos de self específicos em PcDA.", "Apesar dos impactos causados pela apatia na reatividade emocional, tais processos estão preservados em PcDA leve e moderada, de acordo com Mograbi et al. (2012a), um estudo que investig ou o mesmo grupo de pacientes deste trabalho. Além disso, os resultados também destacam o papel de níveis iniciais de consciência da condição na regulação comportamental em PcDA, sugerindo a existência de um monitoramento online de desempenho, principalmen te em experiências de fracasso. Mudanças comportamentais de longo prazo na forma de aprendizagem implícita não foram observadas nos pacientes, sugerimos que formas executivas de anosognosia podem ter impactado este processo, já que correlações entre apatia e persistência não foram encontradas. As contribuições desta tese são potencialmente relevantes para as práticas clínicas e de cuidado, pois permitem uma melhor compreensão da apatia e de como a presença da mesma impacta a regulação emocional e comportam ental. Por fim, o artigo que explora", "os processos de self em PcDA permite uma maior compreensão de como os pacientes estão vivenciando o seu senso de identidade e, ainda, como a apatia pode afetar esses processos, trazendo inghsits de como auxiliar os paci entes na manutenção do seu senso de self.", "Para concluir, serão apresentadas direções futuras de pesquisa. Estudos explorando aspectos específicos de cada dimensão da apatia podem trazer insights substanciais (por exemplo, motivar os pacientes por meio de estímulos processados implicitamente ao invés de comandos cognitivos), reduzindo as consequências da apatia das PcDA e cuidadores. Além da necessidade de novos insights sobre variáveis clínicas e neurais, faltam evidências sobre as possíveis interações ent re as dimensões, ou seja, como elas interagem e se existe uma chance de que a mitigação dos sintomas de uma das dimensões possa reduzir o impacto das outras. Estas informações são fundamentais devido ao crescente interesse em investigar a apatia, uma vez q ue essa síndrome foi reconhecida como um potencial alvo de tratamento (LANCTÔT et al., 2017). Além disso, considerando as associações entre apatia e processos implícitos, mais estudos são necessários para que possamos desenvolver tratamentos mais eficazes. Estes podem, por exemplo, abarcar a ideia de reduzir os níveis de apatia em dimensões específicas para beneficiar a capacidade dos pacientes de reconhecer comprometimentos relacionadas à doença. Da mesma forma, a relação entre apatia e consciência explíci ta pode ser mais explorada, particularmente, como a apatia pode afetar os níveis iniciais de consciência e, assim, impactar a capacidade de monitoramento de erros online. Neste contexto, uma melhor compreensão da anosognosia e seus múltiplos aspectos é ess encial para esclarecer essas associações com a apatia. Além disso, faltam evidências empíricas que elucidem a relação entre apatia e os processos de self na demência. Direções futuras de pesquisa podem investigar como a apatia comportamental, cognitiva e a fetiva se correlacionam com cada processo de self. Essas informações também promoveriam o desenvolvimento de ferramentas de diagnóstico mais precisas e tratamentos que atendam de forma acurada as necessidades de cada paciente. Um exemplo de tratamentos com o este são as intervenções usando fontes externas como gatilhos de memória, que melhoraram o senso de self dos participantes e reduzem a apatia (CRETE -NISHIHATA et al., 2012). Além disso, melhorias nas intervenções terapêuticas e farmacológicas para apatia , anosognosia", "e preservação do self podem levar ao aumento da qualidade de vida dos pacientes, retardo do processo neurodegenerativo em alguns casos e redução da sobrecarga de fa miliares e cuidadores (RITCHIE e TOUCHON, 2000).", "Mais estudos são necessários para uma melhor compreensão do papel dos processos implícitos na promoção da reatividade emocional e da modulação comportamental. Tópicos relevantes são, por exemplo, a relação entre o processamento implícito e explícito e quais fatores afetam a regulação emocional e comportamental. Nesse contexto, os autores também destacam a importância de investigações sobre o impacto da severidade da doença no processamento de informações implícito, pois assim saberemos como estes ocorrem à medida que os comprometimento s aumentam (MARTYR et al., Expandir o corpo de evidências relacionadas aos tópicos explorados nesta tese pode representar a base de conhecimento necessária para o desenvolvimento de conceitos teóricos, como os sete selves da demência. Um trabalho qu e é particularmente relevante para PcDA e o desenvolvimento de soluções para demência.", "APPENDIX C – Table 1.

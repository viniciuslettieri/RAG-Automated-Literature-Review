Reactive Oxygen Species production induces changes in cell physiology and can act as signaling molecule for cell death. Our group had previously demonstrated that infection of endothelial cells with D ENV results in the activation of RNA sensors, production of interferon and proinflammatory cytokines, cell death and permeability. We have also reported that DENV infection promoted ROS production, but the signaling associated to this event and its consequ ences for virus replication and endothelial cell physiology had not been investigated yet. In the present study, we evaluated the role of mitochondrial function and NADPH oxidase activation for ROS production and investigated how these mediators affected b rain microvascular cells (HBMEC) infected by dengue virus (DENV). We observed that HBMECs infected with DENV2, with M.O.I. of 1 showed an increase in ROS production in a NAPH - oxidase and mitochondrial (mitROS) -dependent manner. A final analysis of oxygen consumption, high -resolution respirometry was used and observed that DENV infection in HBMECs induced a decrease in maximal respiratory capacity. Furthermore, our results in membrane potential, suggested that alteration in mitochondrial function, which may be related to mitROS production. We identified that the specific inhibition of mitROS promoted a decrease in virus replication, through plaque assay, and cell death verified by flow cytometry. On the other hand, inhibition of NOX -dependent ROS production i nhibited virus replication, cell death, increased permeability, and the secretion of inflammatory cytokines, including IL -8 and CCL5. These data indicate that DENV replication in endothelial cells induced ROS production by different pathways. Thus, the eve nts triggered by the production of ROS are associated with endothelial activation and vascular damage in DENV infection.", "Keywords: DENV, HBMECs, ROS, Mitochondria, NADH oxidase, cell death", "III LISTA DE FIGURAS demarcado os países ou as áreas com risco de transmissão de dengue. 1 município em 2020. 2 organização genômica. 3 da ligação de receptores transmembranar. 14 via intrínseca. 15", "permanece em repouso quando as subunidades se encontram separadas. 18", "(SOD), catalase (CAT) e glutationa peroxidase (GPx), respectivamente. 20 ocasionado por infecção viral. 21 IV iniciais em HBMECs. 37 imunofluorência. 39 infecção. 40 a concentração não tóxica em HBMECs. 41 NADPH oxidade e via mitocôndria. 42 com DENV. 46 forma independente. 48 V", "permeabilidade das HBMECs infectadas com DENV, mas o ROS produzido via NADPH -oxidase não está associada com este aumento. 54 a secreção de citocinas inflamatórias induzidas pela infecção por DENV em HBMECs. 56 de forma dependente de ativação de RIG -I. 58 ativação de RIG -I. 58 produção de ROS.", "VI LISTA DE SIGLAS E ABREVIATURAS A549 Linhagem celular carcinoma de pulmão humano ADE Potencialização mediada por anticorpos (“Antibody -dependent enhancement ”) Apo Apocininca ATP Trifosfato de adenosina BHK Linhagem celular de fibroblasto de Mesocricetus auratus BSA Albumina sérica bovina C6/36 Linhagem celular da glândula do mosquito Aedes albopictus CARD Domínios de recrutamento e ativação de caspases CAT Catalase CMC Carboxi -metil -celulose CO 2 Gás carbonico DC-SIGN Molécula ligada à adesão intercelular tipo 3 grambina não-ntegrina, do inglês “Dendritic Cell-Specific Intercellular adhesion molecule -3- Grabbing Non-integrin ” DENV Vírus da dengue (“Dengue virus ”) DHL Enzima desidrogenase láctica VII E Glicoproteína do envelope viral ECs Células endoteliais Fc Porção constante da imunoglobulina (“Fragment crystallizable ”) FcgR Receptores para porçã o Fc de imunoglobulinas GPX Glutationa peroxidase GSH Glutationa h p.i.

Introdução", "1.1. Epidemiologia", "Atualmente , a Dengue é uma das mais importantes doenças tropicais do mundo e estima - se que cerca de 390 milhões de pessoas sejam infectadas pelo vírus da Dengue (DENV) anualmente (Guzman et al ., 2016; Teixeira et al ., 2013). Além disso, cerca de 40% da população mundial vive em áreas consideradas de risco de infecção por DENV e, nas últimas 5 décadas, o número de casos teve um aumento de 30 vezes globalmente (OMS, 2017) (Figura 1). A transmissão ocorre por mosquitos vetores do gênero Aedes, principalmente pelo Aedes Stegomyia aegypti e Aedes alpopictus (Ferreira -de-Lima, e Lima -Camara, 2018 ).", "de transmissão de dengue (Adaptado OMS , 2015).", "A dengue é endêmica no Brasil, que apresenta co -circulação dos 4 sorotipos virais (Figura 2). Em 2020 , foram registrados 979.764 casos prováveis, com a taxa de incidência de 466,2 casos por 100 mil habitantes (Ministério da Saúde, 2020). Até outubro de 2021 foram notificados 477.209 casos prováveis, com a taxa de incidência de 223,7 casos de dengue por 100 mil habitantes no Brasil (Ministério da Saúde, 2020).", "50 (Ministério da Saúde, 2020).", "1.2. Estrutura e Replicação do vírus da Dengue", "O vírus da dengue pertence à família Flaviviridae e ao gênero Flavivirus . Foram descritos 4 sorotipos, nomeados de DENV 1 -4 (Guzman et al., 2010). O vírus é envelopado e possui cerca de 50 nm de diâmetro (Kuhn et al., 2002). No envelope viral estão inseridas as glicoproteínas E e M. O capsídeo do DENV dispõe de um formato icosaéd rico formado pela proteína C e pelo genoma , que é constituído de fita simples de RNA, polaridade positiva e com 11kb , aproximadamente . O RNA genômico possui apenas uma fase aberta de leitura (ORF), flanqueada por regiões não codificantes (UTR), apresenta na extremidade 5’ a 5 -metil guanosina (CAP), mas não apresenta a extremidade 3’ poliadenilada ( HARRIS et al., 2006). O genoma codifica uma única poliproteína, que ao ser clivada forma 10 proteínas virais, sendo 3 estruturais - capsídeo (C), envelope (E) e de membrana (M), e 7 proteínas não estruturais - NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B e NS5 (Mukhopadhyay, Kuhn e Rossmann, 2005) (Figura", "madura. Proteína do envelope - E, Proteína de membrana - M e proteína do Core - C. (B) Genoma viral com 5’ CAP, a região de proteínas estruturais e as regiões codificantes de proteína não estrutural e a região 3’ UTR (Guzman et al., 2010; Henchal e Putnak, 1990).", "Para que haja infecção de uma célula -alvo, a proteína E do vírus precisa se ligar a alguns tipos de receptores celulares, tais como: hepar an sulfato, receptor de manose, e DC -SIGN (CD209, receptor de lectina do tipo C ) (Shah et al., 2013), dependendo do tipo celular (Pereira e Kuhn, 2008; Hidari e Suzuki, 2011). Após a ligação, o vírus entra na célula hospedeira por endocitose de forma dependente de clatrina (Acosta et al., 2008; Peng et al., 2009). Em seguida, há uma acidificação do meio intraendossomal e a proteína E sofre um processo de trimerização , que promove a fusão entre a membrana do endossomo e a membrana do envelope viral (Mukhopadhyay et al ., 2005; Zheng et al ., 2010). Após a fusão, o nucleocapsídeo sofre desnudamento no citoplasma, levando a liberação do RNA genômico (RNAg). Como o DENV é um vírus de RNA fita simples polaridade positiva, este RNA mensageiro (RNAm) é traduzido , formando uma única poliproteína , que sofre clivagem por proteases virais e celulares posteriorm ente (Shiryaev et al., 2007).", "A replicação do vírus só acontece após a liberação das proteínas estruturais e não estruturais a partir da clivagem da poliproteína. Assim, se forma o complexo de replicação viral, a partir da interação das regiões complement ares da região 3’ UTR com 5’ UTR e a circularização do RNAg (Filomatori et al., 2011). A RNA polimerase dependente de RN A se associa à extremidade 5’ do genoma e pode ser deslocada em direção a região 3’ UTR. Desta forma , o RNA viral é usado como molde par a a formação do RNA de fita simples negativo, formando o intermediário de RNA dupla fita (RNAfd) (Murray et al ., 2008). O RNA fita simples polaridade negativa serve como o molde para a formação de RNA fita simples polaridade positiva (Friebe e Harris, 2010 ). A formação desses RNA fita simples polaridade positiva possibilita a síntese de novas poliproteínas ou a formação de novos genomas virais (Schmaljohn e Mcclain, 1996).", "Com a realização desses processos, a montagem da partícula viral pode ser iniciada. A montagem dos vírions ocorre no retículo endoplasmático (RE) (Sampath e Pasmanabhan, 2009) com montagem do nucleocapsídeo (NC). Em seguida, ocorre o brotamento do nucleocapsídeo para o lúmen do retículo, sendo adicionado a proteína de envelope (E) e a pro teína precursora de membrana (prM) (Wengler e Wengler, 1989). A proteína prM é, então, clivada por proteases do hospedeiro e a liberação da partícula viral madura ocorre por exocitose (Clyde, Jennifer e Harris, 2006) (Figura 4).", "vesícula e , em seguida, liberação do nucleocapsídeo e desnudamento do ácido nucleico; C - Tradução da poliproteína e endereçamento para o RE; D - Replicação do genoma; E - Montagem das partículas virais no RE e aquisição do envelope e manutenção da forma viral e transporte por vesículas; F - Maturação; G - Liberação da partícula viral infecciosa (Sampath e Padmanabhan, 2009).", "1.3. M anifestações clínicas da dengue", "A dengue é uma doença com amplo espectro clínico e é considerada autolimitante na maioria dos indivíduos (Malavige e Ogg, 2017). A infecção pode ser assintomática, branda (anteriormente chamada dengue clássica), ou evoluir para formas graves (anteriormente chamadas de febre hemorrágica ou síndrome do choque da dengue) (Lee et al, 2016; Fernando et al, 2016). Atualmente , a OMS classifica a doença como: dengue com presença ou ausência de sinais de alerta e dengue grave. A doença é considerada grave, quando há pelo menos uma das seguintes manifestações: disfunção grave de órgãos , ou sangramento grave , ou extravasamento de plasma que pode levar ao choque (OMS, 2009). Os pacientes com dengue podem progredir através de três fases clínicas conhecidas como : fase febril, fase crítica e fase de recuperação (Malavige e Ogg, 2017). Os sintomas da dengue clá ssica são relativamente brandos e são caracterizados por febre, cefaleia, anorexia, náuseas, dor retroorbital, mal ‐estar, congestã o conjuntival, dor lombossacral, prostra ção, sensa ção de paladar alterado, podendo ocorrer erupção maculopapular. Na maioria dos indivíduos, esses sintomas duram de 2 -7 dias, após os quais há recuperação (OMS, 2017; Malavige e Ogg, 2017) . No entanto, alguns indivíduos após a fase febril, entram em uma fase crítica, que dura 24 a 48 horas, e está associada à plaquetopenia, aumento da permeabilidade vascular, extravasamento de plasma e hipotensão, podendo evoluir e desenvolver as formas graves da doença. A dengue grave está, então, associada a um aumento transitório da permeabilidade vascular, e extravasamento de plasma, resultando em acúmulo de líquido nas cavidades pleurais e peritoneais, hipotensão, podendo levar ao choque e ó bito (Malavige e Ogg, 2017 ; Lei et al., 2001). A doença é multifatorial e diversos mecanismos têm sido associados ao seu agravamento (Carvalho e Moreira, 2017). Dentre esses, a dengue grave já foi associada a fatores genéticos virais como o sorotipo e o genótipo viral, e fatores do hospedeiro, como a idade e o estado imune dos indivíduos infectados (Carvalho e Moreira 2017; Clyde, Jenni fer e Harris, 2006). A infecção por um sorotipo confere imunidade a longo prazo somente contra aquele próprio sorotipo ( Henchal, Henchal e Schlesinger , 1988). Entretanto, pode ocorrer uma resposta inespecífica contra os demais. Assim, a teoria do \"pecado antigênico original” sugere que as células T de memória produzidas durante a infecção primária possam reagir, durante uma infecção secundaria, de forma mais imediata, mas com menos eficácia quando comparadas as células naive , o que resultaria em uma resposta imune ineficiente e com produção desregulada de citocinas (Mongkolsapaya et al., 2006). Outra hipótese é a da teoria da potencialização da infecção dependente de anticorpos (ADE). Segundo essa teoria, durante uma infecção secundária anticorpos neutralizantes produzidos a partir da primeira infecção reagem com os vírus da segunda infecção. Apesar disso, a neutralização não ocorre de forma eficiente, o que resultaria no aumento da circulação de imunocomplexos (Halstead et al., 1970; Haltead et al., 1976). A formação desses imunocomplexos facilitaria a entrada do vírus , inclusive de vírus imaturos que são formados durante a infecção em células do hospedei ro, que expressam receptores para porção Fc das imunoglobulinas (FcgR), como monócitos e macrófagos, resultando em maior replicação viral (Haltead et al., 1976).", "Todavia, essas hipóteses não suportam todas as ocorrências observadas na dengue. Além disso, há casos de complicações em infecções primárias em crianças e em adultos (Clyde, Jennifer e Harris, 2006), indicando a possibilidade de outros processos estarem relacionados à gravidade da doença.", "Um fator preponderante na patogênese da dengue é a intensa resposta inflamatória com produção de mediadores , que atuam sobre o endotélio e contribuem para o aumento da permeabilidade vascular ( Commins, Borish e Steinke , 2010). Foi amplamente demonstrado que os soros obtidos de pacientes com manifestação grave da doença apresentam níveis mais elevados de IFN -γ (Interferon gama), TNF -α (Fator de necrose tumoral), IL -2 (Interleucina -2), IL-10 (Interleucina -10), IL -6 (Interleucina -6), IL -8 (Interleucina -8), CCL5 e VEGF -α (Phanthanawiboon et al., 2016, Povoa et al., 2016; Zhao, et al., 2016; Her et al., 2017; Chen et al., 2006). Acredita -se que o aumento dessas citocinas e quimiocinas ocorra, principalmente, devido à indução da sua produção por monócitos e macrófagos infectados ( Borish e Steinke, 2003; Medin et al. , 2005 ). Por outro lado, estudos mostraram que hepatócitos e células endoteliais (EC) são também permissivos ao DENV , cuja a infecção poderia contribuir com o processo inflamatório, através da produção de quimiocinas e citocinas. Esses mediadores podem contribuir para o recrutamento de células inflamatórias e atuar sobre o pró prio endot élio, colaborando para a lesã o endotelial (Her et al., 2017; Nasirudeen et al., 2011; Conceição et al., Outro fator importante descrito para a patogênese da dengue foi a própria proteína viral NS1. Experimentos in vitro demonstraram que níveis elevados de NS1 purificada ativam diretamente macrófagos de camundongos e células mononucleares do sangue periférico humano (PBMC) . Esse fenômeno ocorre através do receptor Toll-like (TLR -4), culmina ndo na produção de citocinas proinflamatórias e quimicionas. Além disso, ainda foi observado que o tratamento com NS1 resultou no aumento de permeabilidade de culturas de ECs in vitro (Modhiran et al., 2015; Beatty et al., 2015). Esses estudos mostraram que esses efeitos são dependentes do reconhecimento do receptor do tipo TLR -4, mas não de TLR -2 e TLR -6, o que tem sido comparado com o choque séptico induzido por lipopolissacarídeo ( LPS) (Modhiran et Finalmente, a própria infecção de células endoteliais pode contribuir para a lesão vascular, com aumento de permeabilidade e extravasamento de plasma, como será discutido a seguir.", "1.2. Células endoteliais: função e papel em doenças inflamatórias e virais As células endoteliais revestem os vasos sanguíneos formando uma barreira com permeabilidade baixa e seletiva para fluidos e solutos em condições fisiológicas normais (Félétou, 20 11; Baldwin e Thurston, 2001). A desregulação da barreira endotelial pode ocorrer devido à uma variedade de fatores como agentes inflamatórios, trombose, traumatismo, bem como durante uma infecção por agentes infecciosos (Yuan e Rigor, 2018 ). As células e ndoteliais representam também um elemento crítico no desenvolvimento de uma resposta inflamatória porque quando ativadas, aumentam a expressão de moléculas de adesão como VCAM -1, ICAM -1 e E -selectina. O aumento dessas moléculas pode ser responsável por rec rutar leucócitos para a região da infecção , levando a potencialização da resposta inflamatória (Anderson et al ., 1997; Cardier et al ., 2005; Peyrefitte et al ., 2006; Conceição et al., 2013).", "1.2.1. Células endoteliais na dengue", "O aumento da permeabilidade vascular é um dos principais fatores associado a patogênese da dengue, e uma série de evidências sugere que esse aumento pode ser consequência da ação de mediadores inflamatórios e/ou vasoativos produzidos, principalmente, por m onócitos. Estudos clínicos demonstraram o aumento de TNF -α, IL -1β e IFN - α em pacientes que possuem a forma grave da doença (Azeredo et al., 2001; Suharti et al., 2003). Além disso, também já foi descrito que monócitos infectados in vitro com DENV produzem esses mesmos mediadores inflamatórios e que eles atuam sobre o endotélio contribuindo com a lesão vascular (Espina et al., 2003; Carr et al., 2003). Em um modelo de infecção murina com DENV -3 foi demonstrado que os animais apresentavam grande aumento de T NF-α, IL -6 e MCPI, associados a um aumento na permeabilidade vascular, sinais hemorrágicos, lesão hepática e intestinal e morte (Phanthanawiboon et al., 2016) . O tratamento dos camundongos com um anticorpo anti-TNF -α murino reduziu os níveis plasmáticos de citocinas e os danos hepáticos, mas não afetou a carga viral. Por outro lado, o tratamento com angiopoietina recombinante, molécula que inibe o extravasamento vascular, retardou a morte dos animais. Esses achados sugerem que a inflamação e a lesão hemorrágica se somam no desenvolvimento da patogênese da dengue grave (Singh et al., 2018; Ong, Ng, Chu , 2013) . Como já mencionado, a lém do impacto de mediadores inflamatórios circulantes, a própria infecção do endotélio pode contribuir para a lesão vascu lar. Tem sido largamente demonstrado que linhagens de células endoteliais e células endoteliais primárias são permissivas ao DENV em modelos in vitro (Avirutnan et al., 1998; Basu et al., 2011; Conceição et al., 2013; Bunyaratvej et al., 1997; Huang et al., 2000; Arevalo et al, 2009; Dalrymple e Mackow 2011), e in vivo (Kyle et al., 2008 ; Zellweger, Prestwood e Sheresta, 2010). Além disso, análises post-mortem detectaram presença de vírus nas células endoteliais em diferentes tecidos de pacientes infectados com DENV (Jessie et al., 2004; Kyle et al., 200 8; Povoa et al., 2014). Análise s de autópsia s evidenciaram apoptose de células endoteliais em diferentes teci dos (Ramos et al., 1998; Limonta et al., 2007) e pontos de necrose próximos a vasos sanguíneos (Povoa et al ., 2016; Limonta et al ., 2007). Esses achados sugerem que a morte de células endoteliais pode ser um dos elementos envolvidos n o aumento d a permeabil idade vascular observada na doença .", "A ativação das células endoteliais está associada principalmente, com o reconhecimento viral e ativação de receptores de reconhecimento padrão (PRR). A ativação de RIG -I, MDA -5 e TLR -3 por DENV foi demonstrada em células mielóides, hepáticas e células endoteliais , sendo associada à liberação de citocinas pró -inflamatórias como: IL -1β, IL -6, IL -8, IFN e TNF - α (Loo et al., 2008; Tan e Chu, 2013; Conceição et al., 2013). Além disso, o vírus da dengue reduz a expressão de proteínas de junções como a ZO -1, Claudina -1, PECAM -1 e VE -caderina em células endoteliais, o que também contrubui para as alterações de permeabilidade do tecido , ainda que não haja morte celular (Soe et al., 2017).", "Dados do nosso grupo mostraram que as células do endotélio microvascular cerebral humano (HBMECs) são permissivas ao DENV. Essa infecção induziu o aumento de expressão de sensores de RNA fita dupla citoplasmáticos: RIG -I (Gene I induzido por áci do retinóico) e MDA -5 (Gene 5 associado à diferenciação do melanoma ) o que está relacionado com o aumento da produção de IFN -β (Interferon -β), IL6, IL8, CCL5, e da expressão de ICAM (Conceição et al., 2013). Também foi observado pelo nosso grupo que a infecção de HBMECs por DENV leva a morte celular, associada a perda de integridade da membrana plasmática, e consequentemente, induz aumento na permeabilidade das monocamadas celulares (Papa, 2014). Dados preliminares do nosso grupo sugeriram que células bystander presentes nas culturas com DENV apresentaram maior taxa de morte celular em relação às células infectadas. A morte das células bystander foi inibida ou retardada, parcialmente , pela adição de inibidores de RIPK1 (Proteína cinase de interação com o receptor 1 ), sugerindo a indução de necroptose nessas culturas (Papa, 2014).", "1.3. Reconhecimento viral e seu papel na ativação e morte celular", "A ativação celular e as respostas de estresse em células infectadas por vírus podem ser geradas pela detecção de macromoléculas virais; incluindo o próprio genoma viral, intermediários de fita dupla de RNA e proteínas virais. Essa detecção ocorre através de receptores de reconhecimento de padrões (PRRs). O engajamento desses leva ao recrutamento de moléculas adapt adoras , que culmina na estimulação de fatores de transcrição, consequentemente, induz indo a expressão de IFN do tipo I e citocinas pró -inflamatórias (Chang et al., 2006; Kato et al., 2006; Boo e Yang, 2010; Muñoz -Jordán e Fredericksen, 2010). Os vírus de RNA podem ser reconhecidos por diferentes tipos de PRRs, incluindo sensores de RNA citossólicos ou endossomais. A ativação do receptor endossomal TLR3 inicia após o reconhecimento de moléculas de RNAs de fita dupla em vesículas endossomais. Ess e reconhecimento induz uma via de transdução de sinal que se inicia pelo recrutamento da molécula adaptadora contento domínio TIR indutor de IFN -β (TRIF). Esse recrutamento induz a ativação de TBK ( TANK binding kinase ) e do complexo IkB cinase (IKK), que c ulmina na ativação de IRFs ( Interferon regulatory transcription factor ) e NF -kB (Fator de transcrição) , respectivamente. O complexo formado é translocado para o núcleo, ativando a transcrição de genes e produção de mediadores (Valadão, 2016).", "Os sensores citoplasmáticos RIG -I e MDA5 reconhecem moléculas de RNAfd no citoplasma celular. Esse reconhecimento provoca uma alteração conformacional nesses receptores com a exposição do domínio CARD (Domínios de recrutamento e ativação de caspases), permitindo o rec rutamento da proteí na adaptadora MAVS (Prote ína de sinalizaçã o mitocondrial antiviral). Esse recrutamento proporciona uma cascata de sinalização com a fosforilação e translocação dos fatores de transcrição IRF -3 e de IRF -7 do citoplasma para o núcleo, induzindo a expressão de IFN do tipo I ( YU et al., 2012; Chen et al., 2013; Zeng e Chen, 2008) . A ativação desses sensores propicia a produção de citocinas proinflamatórias e quimiocinas , como IL -6, IL -8, TNF - α e CCL5 . Esses mediadores induz em o recrutame nto e a ativação de outros tipos celulares , amplificando a inflamação (Figura 5) (He et al., 2011; O’ Leary et al., 2012; Lucas e Maes, 2013).", "MDA5 reconhecem o intermediário RNAfd no citoplasma, (2) após este reconhecimento ocorre uma alteração conformacional, o que expõe o domínio CARD (Domínios de recrutamento e ativação de caspases) e consequentemente o recrutamento da proteína adaptadora MAVS. (3) Esse recrutamento, resulta em uma cascata de sinalização o que induz a translocação dos fatores de transcrição IRF -3 e de IRF -7 do citoplasma para o núcleo, induzindo a expressão de IFN do tipo I, citocinas proinflamatórias e quimiocinas como IL -6, IL -8, TNF - α e CCL5 (Adaptado. Valadão et al., 2016).", "A ativação desses fatores também está associada com a indução de sinais de morte celular. A ativação de IRF -3 via RIG -I estimula uma série de genes relacionados com a apoptose (Chattopadhyay et al., 2010). A ativação de RIG -I em hepatócitos infectados com o vírus da Hepatite C (HCV) também induziu apoptose dependente de TRAIL ( Ligante indutor de apoptose relacionado a TNF) (Yang et al., 2011). Estudos em linhagens de fibroblastos e em células endoteliais mostraram que a ativação via TLR3 induz morte celular de forma dependente de TRIF (Kaiser et al., 2013). E, a ativação de células dendríticas com poli I:C, mimetizando ativação por RNAfd , levou a morte celular por necroptose, de forma dependente de MAVS ( Zou et al., 2013).", "1.4. Morte celular em resposta as infecções virais", "O processo de biossíntese viral altera diretamente o metabolismo celular; assim , uma infecção viral pode gerar respostas de estresse na célula hospedeira buscando recuperar a homeostase celular (Fernandez -Garcia et al., 2009). Para que oc orra essa recuperação, a célula induz respostas como inibição transitória da síntese de proteínas, estresse de retí culo endoplasm ático, alteração da função mitocondrial e produção de espécies reativas de oxigênio (ROS ) (Valadão, 2016). Entretanto, a manute nção desses estímulos pode ocasionar a morte dessas células. Por outro lado, os vírus precisam de mecanismos de escape ou retardo da indução de morte celular, para permitir que ocorra a replicação viral. As três vias de morte celular melhor caracterizadas são: apoptose, necrose e piroptose. Entretanto, nas últimas décadas, diferentes mecanismos de morte celular têm sido descritos, incluindo, necroptose, morte por abertura de poro de transição de permeabilidade mitocondrial (MPTP), NETose, pironecrose e piroptose (Kist e Vucic, 2021; D'Arcy, 2019; Nirmala e Lopus, 2020). Além dessas vias de morte celular, a autofagia, estratégia que normalmente é responsável pela garantia da so brevivência da célula, também pode induzir a morte celular por mecanismos como a autose (Kist e Vucic, 2021; D'Arcy, 2019; Nirmala e Lopus, 2020). Os estudos vêm ressaltando que dificilmente essas vias funcionam sozinhas, pois as evid ências experimentais apontam que muitas vias compartilham componentes e princípios de sinalização.", "1.4.1. Apoptose", "Apoptose morfologicamente é caracterizada pela compactação do núcleo e condensação da cromatina, seguidos de fragmentação do DNA. Assim, as células se dividem em pequenos corpos apoptóticos , que contém componentes nucleares e organelas citoplasmáticas. Durante o período inicial desse processo, observa -se a preservação da integridade estrutural e funcional da membrana plasmática e preservação dos lisossomos (Darzynk iewicz et al., 1997). Ainda durante essa fase inicial, ocorre mobilização de cálcio intracelular, desorganização de fosfolipídeos, diminuição de microtúbulos , em conjunto, esses fatores permitem a exposição da fosfatidilserina (PS) na superfície extra celular (Orzalli e Kagan, 2017; Barnaba, 2013; Elmore, A indução de apoptose depende da ativação das caspases, que são proteases aspartato - específicas. Inicialmente, essas caspases são produzidas em uma forma inativa, chamada de pró-caspases e se tornam ativas após sua clivagem (Orzalli e Kagan, 2017, Boathight e Salvesen, 2003). Atualmente, em mamíferos , já foram descritos 12 tipos de caspases , que são divididas em 2 grupos: caspases iniciador as (caspases -1, -2, -4, -5, -8, -9, -10, -11, -12) e caspases efetoras ( -3, -6, -7). A indução da apoptose pode estar associada à um mecanismo de defesa celular durante infecções virais, uma vez que a morte da célula infectada contribuiria para o controle da disseminação viral (Fan et al., 2014).", "A apoptose extrínseca, ou também conhecida como “via do receptor de morte” é ativada por sinais externos a célula. Esses sinais contemplam radicais livres, agentes químicos, biológicos ou físicos, que são capazes de interagir e estimular receptores que estão presente s na superfície celular ( Lavrik , Golks e Krammer, 2005). Os receptores celulares responsáveis pela indução da morte celular pertencem a família transmembrana do tipo I, podendo ser : fator de morte tumoral 1 (TNFR1) , Fas (CD95) , DR3, receptor relacionado ao ligante indutor de apoptose TNF 1 (TRAILR1), TRAILR2, DR6, receptor ectodisplasina A (EDAR) e receptor do fator de crescimento do nervo (Figura 6) (Lavrik, Golks e Krammer, 2005).", "transmembranar. O domínio de morte DD do receptor transmembrana Fas recruta a proteína FADD e ativa Caspase -8. A caspase 8 por ser iniciadora, ativa a caspase 3. Em seguida, a caspase 3 por ser efetora ativa as endonucleases e a ssim, é iniciado o processo de fragmentação do DNA (Fonte: Lana Meuren).", "A ligação do ligante ao receptor de morte induz a clivagem da pró -caspase 8 em caspase 8, que é uma caspase iniciadora. Em seguida, a caspase 8, ativa a caspase efetora 3, cuja funçã o é ativa r endonucleases. Após a ativação dessas caspases, inicia -se o processo de clivagem do DNA (Figura 6) (Chang e Yang, 2000; Li e Yuan, 2008).", "A via intrínseca de apoptose, também conhecida como via mitocondrial, é ativada em resposta a vários tipos de estresse intracelular, tais como: danos no DNA, estresse de retículo endoplasmático (ER), estresse por replicação, e até mesmo pelo aumento de ROS (Czabotar et al., 2014; Pihán, Carreras -Sureda e Hetz, 2017 ; Roos, Thomas e Kaina, 2016 ; Vitale et al., 2017; Nunez et al ., 1990; Brumatti, Salmanidis e Ekert, 2010). O estresse celular induz alterações morfofuncionais da mitocôndria, levando a liberação do citocromo C. O acoplamento do citocromo C à molécula adaptadora Apaf -1 (fator de ativação da apoptose) forma o apoptossomo e culmina na ativação da pró -caspase 9, dando origem à caspase 9 ativa . Essa, p or sua vez, leva a ativação da pró-caspase 3 (Figur a 7) (Chang e Yang, 2000; Grutter, 2000).", "intrínseca ocorre em resposta a algum estresse intracelular. A presença do estresse celular estimula alterações na morfologia mitocondrial, culminando na libe ração do citocromo C. O citocromo C após ser liberado, acopla à molécula adaptadora Apaf -1. Com isto, ocorre a ativação da pró -Caspase 9, formando o complexo apoptossomo. Esse complexo, por sua vez é responsável pela ativação da Caspase 9, que promove a ativação da pró -Caspase 3 (Fonte: Lana Meuren).", "A apoptose é ainda regulada por proteínas da família Bcl -2. Essa família está dividida em 2 grupos: pró -apoptóticas (Bax, Bad, Bid, Bcl -xS, Bak, Box, Bik, Blk, Bim, Hrk, BNIP3), que estão localizadas , principalmente , nas mitocôndrias e na membrana externa; anti - apoptóticas (Bcl -2, Bcl -xl, A1, Mcl -1), presentes na membrana nuclear e no retículo endoplasmático ( Jeong e Seol, 2008 ; Voss e Strasser, 2020 ). A regulação da apoptose a partir dessa família oco rre a partir do balanço entre as proteínas pró e anti -apoptótic as (Spanos et al.,", "1.4.2. Necroptose", "A necrose é caracterizada pelo inchaço do citoplasma, das organelas e a ruptura da membrana plasmática, e em seguida a perda dos componentes citopl asmaticos (Kroemer et al., 2009). A necrose durante um tempo foi considerada como uma via de morte celular simples e sem um mecanismo que a regule (Vandenabeele et al., 2010). Contudo, nos últimos tempos foi descrito um mecanismo de morte celular também associado à perda de integridade de membrana e extravasamento de conteúdo citoplasmático, de forma independente de caspase (Orzalli e Kagan, 2017). Esse mecani smo, entã o, foi denominado como necrose programada ou necroptose (Vandenabeele et al., 2010). A indução da necroptose ocorre de forma RIPK1 ou RIPK3 dependente (Grootjans, Berghe e Vandenabeele, 2017; Cho et al., 2009; Vandenabeele et al., 2010; Mocarski, Upton e K aiser, 2011). A indução dessa via de morte também pode ocorrer através da ativação de receptores de morte como, TNFR1 , receptores de reconhecimento de patógenos , como por exemplo, TLR-3 e TLR -4 (Laster, Wood, Gooding, 1988; Vercammen et al., 1997; Chan et al., 2003; Vandenabeele et al., 2010). O engaja mento desses receptores promove mudanças conformacionais , que induzem o recrutamento de RPIK1, RIPK3, TRADD, FAAD e caspase 8 , formando um complexo. A caspase 8, é responsável por clivar RIPK1 e RIPK3, desta f orma desencadear a morte celular via apoptose. Entretanto, quando há a inibição da caspase 8, ocorre a fosforilação de RIPK1 e RIPK3 (Grootjans, Berghe e Vandenabeele, 2017). A montagem do complexo pró -necrótico leva a ativação de NFκB, produção de ROS e a morte das células (Festjens et al., 2006).", "Diferentes mecanismos de morte celular têm sido associados à infecção por DENV. Já foi demonstrado que a infecção por DENV induz a apoptose de células endoteliais in vitro (Avirutnan et al ., 1998; Yen et al ., 2008; Vásquez, et al ., 2009; Liao, Xu, Huang, 2010). Corroborando esses dados, também foi visto que durante a infecção por DENV a produção de TNF -α potencializa à morte de células microvasculares de camundongos via apoptose celular (Barth et al., 2006; Chen et al., 2007). Além disso, estudos anteriores sugerem que a infecção por DENV em hepatócitos culmina na morte destas células via apoptose ( Thepparit et al ., 2013 ). Também já foi descrito que a própria resposta imune gerada durante a infecção viral, como a produção de TNF -α, IFN, ROS e de óxido nítrico (NO) podem estar associados à regulação da morte por apoptose (Orzalli e Kagan, 2017, Yen et al., 2008; Wu -hsieh, Yen e Chen, 2009; Limonta et al., 2014).", "1.5. Espécies Reativas de Oxigênio (ROS)", "As Espécies Reativas de oxigênio (ROS) compreendem uma gama de subprodutos derivados do oxigênio molecular (O 2), podendo ser em forma de radicais livres ou não (Halliwell e Gutterridge, 2015). Esses mediadores são produzidos durante a redução incompleta do oxigênio e incluem o ânion de superóxido (O 2), peróxido de hidrogênio (H 2O2) e radicais hidroxilas (OH.) (Baud e Ardaillou, 1986). ROS são comumente produzidas durante o metabolismo aeróbio , estresse contínuo, exposição a luz UV, e infecção viral (Mittler et al., 2011; Reshi et al., 2014). O principal subproduto formado na redução de O 2 é o radical ânion superóxido (O2• -), pois ocorre após a transferência de um único elétron. Durante a fosforilação oxidativa, por volta de 1% a 2% do oxigênio utilizado é con vertido em superóxido (Kowaltowski e Vercesi, 1999) A produção de ROS pode ocorrer por diferentes enzimas presentes em sítios celulares, incluindo a NADPH oxidase (NOX), xantana oxigenase, ciclo -oxigenase e lipo -oxigenase, e através da fosforilação oxidati va na mitocôndria (Valadão, 2016; Pillai et al., 2019 ; Harijith et As lipoxigenases (LOX) catalisam a hidroperoxidação de ácidos graxos poli - insaturados. Os produtos da via da LOX têm múltiplas funções, como reguladores de crescimento, composto s antimicrobianos, como moléculas de sinalização (Rosahl, 1996; Harijith et al., 2014). A Xantina oxidase catalisa a oxidação de vários substratos, incluindo purinas (xantina e hipoxantina), pteridinas, moléculas heterocíclicas, e aldeídos. Existe uma grande variedade de aceptores de elétrons existe para a xantina oxidase, como O 2, NAD1, metileno azul, quinonas, ferricianeto e nitrato. Tais reações levam à produção de radicais de superóxido e peróxido de hidrogênio (Lacy, Gough e Schmid -Schonbein, 1998). As NADPH oxidases são um complexo enzimático transmembrana, cuja especialização é produzir ROS pela transferência de elétrons do doador NADPH para o oxigênio molecular (Bedard e Krause, 2007). O produto da transferência de elétrons é o superóxido. A NADPH oxidase é formada por seis subunidades: as proteínas transmembrana p22phox e gp91phox, que formam o sítio catalítico da enzima; três proteínas citosólicas, p47phox, p67phox, p40phox (phox - phagocyte oxidase); e uma GTPase (Rac1 ou Rac2). A separação desses componentes é o que garante o complexo NADPH oxidase permaneça inativo. Para que ocorra a ativação desse complexo é importante que haja a fosforilação de p47phox e RhoGDI, fenômeno que induz alterações estruturais, permitindo, assim, a migração dos demais componentes do complexo localizados no citoplasma para a membrana (Figura 8) (Bedard e Krause, 2007). A fosforilação de p47phox pode ser ativada por proteínas, como a trombina; pelo fator de crescimento derivado de plaquetas (PDGF); LDL; e por citocinas co mo a IL -6, IL -1, TNF -α (O' Donnell, et al., 2003; Kaur, Dhaunsi e Turner, 2004 ; Kim et al., 2007; Behrens, Ali e Dugan, 2008; Filip -Ciubotaru", "subu nidades se encontram separadas. A ativação do complexo enzimático ocorre através da fosforilação da p47phox, o que resulta na migração de todos os componentes para a membrana (Adaptado. McCann e Roulston,", "Outra fonte importante de geração de ROS é o processo de fosforilação oxidativa que ocorre nas mitocôndrias. ROS são gerados nos complexos I, II e III na cadeia respiratória, quando a fuga de elétrons do complexo I e III leva a redução parcial do oxigênio para formação de superóxido. Em seguida, a superóxido dismutase 2 (SOD2), que está present e na matriz mitocondrial, e a superóxido dismutase 1 (SOD1), localizada no espaço intermembrana mitocondrial, convertem o superóxido em H 2O2 (Hamanaka e Chandel, 2010). Tanto o superóxido quanto o peróxido de hidrogênio, gerados durante esse processo são considerados ROS mitocondriais (mitROS) (Figura 9) (Hamanaka e Chandel, 2010).", "celular. Durante este processo, ocorre a fuga de elétrons do complexo I e III levando a redução parcial do oxigênio para formação de superóxido. (Li et al ., 2013). Em seguida, a superóxido dismutase (SOD ) transforma o superóxido em peróxido e a atividade da glutationa peroxidase (GPX ) converte H2O2 em H 2O.", "O aumento da produção de mitROS pode ocorrer por diversas alterações celulares, incluindo uma baixa de produção de ATP, falta de equilíbrio na relação NADH/ NAD+ e até mesmo através da despolarização da membrana interna. Esses fatores podem contribuir para o aumento na perda de elétrons nos complexos I e III da cadeia respiratória, gerando ROS (Turrens, 2003; Krylatov et al., 2018; Magnani et al., 2020). O acúmulo de ROS pode, então, induzir a despolarização da membrana mitocondrial, potencializando o dano mitocondrial (Zorov, Juhaszova e Sollott, 2014; Fukai e Fukai, 2020).", "As espécies reativas de oxigênio podem atuar como moléculas sinalizadoras em uma série de eventos celulares e são essenciais para homeostasia celular. Entretanto, o desequilíbrio na produção das ROS com excesso de s eus níveis intracelulares, levam a um estado conhecido como estresse oxidativo (Reshi, Su e Hong, 2014). Nesse cenário, o excesso de ROS pode causar danos importantes nas células, como por exemplo, danos às proteínas, aos lipídeos das membranas celulares, e até mesmo ao DNA e culminar em ativação de vias de morte celular (Halliwell e Cross, 1994).", "Em contrapartida, mecanismos antioxidantes podem ser disparados para evitar o estresse oxidativo. Os antioxidantes podem ser compostos por sistemas enzimáticos e / ou não enzimáticos. Os antioxidantes não enzimáticos são adquiridos pelos organismos de forma dependente da alimentação, como o caso das vitaminas A e E, carotenoides, glutationa e os flavonóides (Costantini, 2019; Ratnam et al ., 2006). O sistema antioxi dante composto por componentes enzimáticos é formado por catalase (CAT), superóxido dismutase (SOD) e glutationa peroxidase (GPx) (Costantini, 2019; Reshi, Su e Hong, 2014). A SOD é uma metaloenzima que possui três isoformas: a citoplasmática (Cu/ZnSOD), m itocondrial (MnSOD) e extracelular (Cu/ZnSOD). A enzima é responsável por controlar o efeito oxidante do radical O2• -, através da dismutação do ânion superóxido e sua conversão em peróxido de oxigênio (Figura 10) (Perry et al., 2010). A CAT é uma proteína homotetramérica (240 kDa) responsável por reduzir o H 2O2 em duas moléculas de água e uma de oxigênio. A enzima está presente , principalmente , nos peroxissomos, organela que mais produz H 2O2 (Figura 10) (Valko et al., 2006). A glutationa é um tripeptídeo linear (γ –glutamil –cisteinilglicina) e cerca de 98% da glutationa presente na célula se encontra na forma reduzida (GSH) , enquanto 2% estão na forma oxidada (GSSG). A enzima GPx é que catalisa GSH em GSSG (Meister e Anderson, 1983 ). Essa reação está acopla da à redução do H 2O2 em água (Figura 10) (Halliwell, 2007).", "peroxidase (GPx), respectivamente. A enzima superóxido dismutase (SOD) converte o ânion supe róxido (O2• -) em peróxido de hidrogênio (H 2O2). As enzimas catalase (CAT) e a glutationa peroxidase (GPx) reduzem H 2O2 em água e oxigênio molecular. Fonte: (Adaptado . Peng et al., 2014 ).", "O fator de transcrição Nrf2 é um dos principais fatores que regulam genes desintoxicantes e antioxidantes de ROS (Deramaudt, Dill e Bonay, 2013). Em condições normais, es se fator se encontra presente no citosol associado à proteína 1 associada à ECH do tipo Kelch (Keap1 ). Essa associação facilita a ubiquitinação de Nrf2 e evita a translocação do fator para o núcleo (Cullinan et al., 2004). Quando ocorre uma situação e estresse, o que pode ser desencadeado por uma infecção viral, por exemplo, a Keap 1 se dis socia de Nfr2 , promovendo a translocação d este fator para o núcleo. Com isso, ocorre a ativação de genes relacionados com a homeostasia celular (Figura 11) (Ramezani, Nahad e Faghihloo, 2018; Zhang et al., 2019).", "do estado de estresse oxidativo ocasionado por uma infecção viral ou outro patógeno, o complexo Nrf2/Keap1 se dissocia e o Nrf2 transloca para o núcleo o nde este fator de transcrição leva a ativação de vários genes envolvidos na homeostase redox.

Produção de ROS em resposta a infecção viral", "O processo de repli cação viral produtiva induz e depende de uma série de alterações no metabolismo celular, incluindo alterações de morfologia e função mitocondrial, estresse de retículo e reconhecimento viral que podem levar a produção de ROS e estresse oxidativo. De fato, as infecções virais comumente induzem um cenário de estresse oxidativo , resulta ndo em Produção de ROS Dano celular induzido por ROS Morte de células infectadas Cisteína diferentes danos celulares, tais como mutações no DNA, indução de citocinas, alteração na transcrição, indução de morte celular, dentre outros (Pillai et al ., 2019). Diversos estudos apontam que a produção de ROS pode ter efeitos anti - ou pró -replicação viral, dependendo da célula e vírus envolvidos (Olagnier et al., 2014; Shindo et al., 2013; Wu et al., 2017; Kim e Dentre os flavivirus, o vírus da hepatite C (HCV) é um do que foi mais investigado no que diz respeito à indução e papel do estresse oxidativo na infecção. Níveis elevados de ROS e redução nos níveis de antioxidantes foram detectados em fígados de pacientes com infecções por HCV (Yadav et al., 2002). A infecção viral pode também levar a ativação da via NADPH oxidase. Foi demonstrado que a infecção de uma linhagem celular de hepatócitos humanos (Huh7) por HCV induziu a ativação de NOX 1 e 4, de forma dependente de TGFβ1 (Ivanov et al., 2015). Nesse trabalho caracterizou -se que uma região de 36 aminoácidos presente na porção N-terminal da proteína era re sponsável pela ativação de NOX. Outros estudos também demonstraram que a proteína do nucleocapsídeo de HCV induz aumento de produtos da peroxidação de lipídios e leva ao aumento de cálcio nas mitocôndrias em hepatócitos . Todos esses processos culminam no aumento da produção de ROS na mi tocôndria, sendo NOX , então, considerada uma das principais contribuintes para o aumento do estresse oxidativo ( Ivanov et As proteínas E1, E2 também já foram associadas ao aumento de ROS e alteração da homeostase do Ca2+ intracelular em hepatócitos (Ivanov et al., 2011; Ming -Ju et al., 2011). Além disso, em monócitos humanos, observou -se que as proteínas NS3 e NS5A também induziram o estresse oxidativo, através do aumento da absorção de cálcio, gerando oxid ação da glutationa nas mitocôndrias e, por consequência, aumento na produção de ROS (Bureau et al., 2001; García -Mediavilla et al., 2005 ; Thoré n et al., 2004). A infecção de linfócitos por HCV também acarreta na indução do estresse oxidativo, alterando a h omeostasia mitocondrial e, por conseguinte, a permanência desse estresse desencadeia em danos ao DNA mitocondrial (Bhargava et al., 2011).", "A infecção pelo vírus sincicial respiratório (VSR) em células A549 (Linhagem celular carcinoma de pulmão humano) induz alterações na bioenergética mitocondrial, através da diminuição do potencial de membrana mitocondrial, diminuição n a taxa de consumo de oxigênio (OCR ) máxim a, do consumo basal e da OCR ligado ao ATP (Hu et al., 2019a; Hu et al., 2019) . O aumento da p rodução de ROS foi demonstrado na infecção pelo VSR em células A549 , e este aumento favorece a replicação viral. Além disso, foi demonstrado que ao tratar o camundongo BALB/c com um inibidor de ROS mitocondrial, os animai s apresentaram redução nos marcadores de inflamação (Hu et al., 2019a; Hu et al., 2019).", "Em relação à infecção por DENV, o estresse oxidativo foi descrito em diferentes modelos, tendo sido relacionado com a gravidade da doença (Gil et al., 2004). Em pacientes com dengue grave não foi observado alterações nas taxas de glutationa (GSH) e de antioxidante total (TAS). Entretanto, foi visto aumento significativo no potencial de peroxidação (PP), na peroxidação lipídica e na quantificação da enzima superóxido dismutase (SOD) e níveis mais baixos na dosagem da glutationa peroxidase (GPx) (Gil et al ., 2004). Além disso, foi demonstrado que DENV altera a homeostasia redox , induzindo o estresse oxidativo e este evento é responsável pelo aumento da replicação viral em monócitos obtidos de pacien tes infectados (Al-alimi et al., 2014).", "Em modelos de infecção por DENV in vitro , o aumento da produção de ROS foi demonstrado em células dendríticas derivadas de monócitos (Mo -DC), hepatócitos e células endoteliais (Lin et al., 2000; Yen et al., 2008; Wu -Hsieh et al., 2009; Olagnier et al., 2014). Em Mo -DC, o aumento da produção de ROS foi dependente da ativação de NOX, mostr ando - se importante para replicação viral, ativação e morte celular (Olaigner et al., 2014). Em modelos de infecção de hep atócitos , a produção de ROS induziu ativação do fator nuclear de ativação para a sinalização da expressão de IL -6 (NF -IL-6), que culminou na secreção de CCL5, indicando o papel do estresse oxidativo também na ativação deste tipo celular (Lin et al., 2000) . Já no modelo de células endoteliais da veia umbilical humana (HUVEC), a infecção por DENV induziu o aumento da produção de ROS e RNS . Essas moléculas atuaram como sinalizadoras de morte celular, aumento a permeabilidade vascular e induzi ram as células à morte por apoptose (Yen et al ., 2008). Dados desse trabalho ainda demonstraram que camundongos depletados de p47phox ou em tratamento com Apocinina, apresentaram redução de hemorragia, sugerindo que a produção de ROS derivado de NOX induz dano vascular e é importante para a indução de morte celular (Yen et al., 2008) .", "Além da ativação de NOX, outros modelos demon straram que a infecção por DENV induz alteração na morfologia e na bioenergética mitocondrial, mas não há dados que demonstrem o papel do aumento de mitROS na replicação viral (El -Bacha et al., 2007; Chatel - Chaix et al., 2016).", "No geral, em um cenário de infecção viral, os trabalhos dem onstram que o aumento da produção de ROS está associado com o um papel antiviral ( Olagnier et al., 2014; Wu et al., 2017; Kim et al., 2013 ). Inclusive, já foi descrito que a infecção por DENV induz o aumento na produção de ROS em células dendríticas associad o a um efeito antiviral e de indução de morte celular (Olagnier et al., 2014; Shindo et al., 2013).", "Por outro lado, o vírus pode se favorecer do aumento de ROS, através da indução de autofagia. Durante a evolução, os vírus adquiriam a capacidade de usufruir da indução da autofagia para o favorecimento da replicação viral (Choi et al., 2019). As espécies reativas derivadas da NADPH -Oxidase 2 são capazes de induzir a autofagia (Xiao et al., 2021; Jing et al., 2019). A infecção por diferentes flaviviru s induziu autofagia em monócitos e este evento foi importante para proteger as células de outras respostas ao estresse e morte celular precoce (McLean et al ., 2011). A infecção por DENV já demonstrou induzir a autofagia ta nto em modelos de células HepG2. (Panyasrivanit et al., 2009a; Panyasrivanit et al., 2009). Datan e colaboradores (2016) descreveram que a infecção por DENV em células renais canina s (MDKC) induz o aumento de ROS de forma dependente de ER, cujo efeito está relacionado à indução de autofag ia. Ainda, nesse modelo, a indução da autofagia foi importante para a replicação viral (Datan et al., 2016).", "Diferentes mecanismos podem estar associados ao disparo da produção de ROS durante o processo de replicação viral. Estudos apontam que o acesso ao metabolismo glicolítico e mitocondrial durante a replicação viral é uma estratégia que os vírus utilizam para obter moléculas de alta energia ao seu favor, utilizando -as para replicação e montagem viral de forma mais eficiente (Widnell et al., 1990 ; Garry e Bostick , 1986; El -Bacha et al., 2004). Finalmente, o sensing viral também pode induzir a produção de ROS via NOX ou mitoc ondria l. A ativação de receptores semelhantes a NOD (NLRs) foi associad a ao aumento da produção de ROS dependente de NOX2 (Lipinski et al., 2009). Além disso, ativação via TLR4 em macrófagos e ne utrófilos também induz estresse oxidativo (Asehnoune et al., 2004; Park et al., 2004). Também foi relatado que o sensing do vírus de RNA com TLR7 aumenta a ativação de NOX, com isso ocorre o estado de estresse oxidativo (Valadão et al., 2016). Além disso, o sensing de RNA pelo sensor citoplasmático RIG -I leva a ativação de MAVS, associado à mitocôndria. Essa ativação pode impactar a função mitocondrial e a geração de ROS por essa via (Buskiewicz et al., 2016 ).", "2. Racional", "Nosso grupo de pesquisa vem caracterizando os efeitos gerados pela infecção de células de endotélio microvascular humano (HBMEC) pelo DENV, incluindo o efeito da infecção na ativação celular, lesão endotelial e morte celular. Este modelo celular, é utiliza do como modelo de célula endotelial no geral, mas também é considerado um modelo de barreira hematoencefálica. Dados do grupo mostram que DENV ativa as células endoteliais via RIG - I/MAVS, gerando a secreção de citocinas inflamatórias , normalmente , aumentad as durante a infecção. Além disso, nosso grupo também demonstrou que a infecção por DENV induz aumento da permeabilidade endotelial in vitro e morte celular, pelo menos em parte associada ao processo de necroptose (Papa, 2014). Dados preliminares gerados durante a dissertação de mestrado sugeriam que a infecção de HBMECs por DENV induzia produção de ROS (Meuren, 2016). Uma vez que foi demonstr ado em diferentes modelos que ROS pode interferir em vias de replicação viral e levar a morte celular, na presente tese objetivamos avaliar se estes mediadores estariam envolvidos na replicação de DENV em células endoteliais , em mudanças na permeabilidade e na lesão endotelial na dengue.

HBMECs foram cultivadas com mock ou infectadas com DENV por diferentes períodos de tempo entre 24 e 72 horas. Em seguida, avaliamos o consumo de oxigênio , utilizando agentes que interferem em diferentes parâmetros respirat órios. Inicialmente, foi avaliada a taxa de consumo de oxigenio (OCR) basal das células intactas no próprio meio de cultura. Em seguida, adicionamos Oligomicina , que inibe o retorno dos prótons localizados no espaço intermembranar para a matriz mitocondria l, por levar a inibição da subunidade Fo da FoFI-ATP -sintase. Assim, determinamos o OCR independente da síntese de ATP. Para avaliar a capacidade respiratória máxima, adicionamos FCCP, um ionóforo que carreia os prótons de volta à matriz mitocondrial, promovendo o desacoplamento entre o consumo do oxigênio e a síntese de ATP. Com esses parâmetros, foi possível avaliar a respiração basal (antes da adição de Oligomicina ), a taxa de consumo independente de ATP ou desacoplada (uncoupled OCR , após a adição de Oligomicina ), a taxa associada a ATP ou acoplada (coupled OCR , resultante da diferença entre respiração antes e após adição de Oligomicina), a capacidade máxima respiratória (após adição de FCCP), e a capacidade de reserva (resultante da diferença entre a respiração obtida após adição de FCCP e a respiração basal).", "Após 24h de infecção não detectamos nenhuma diferença significativa nos parâmetros respiratórios das células infectadas com DENV em relação as células cultivadas com mock (Figuras 20A -B). Porém, em 48h p.i. as HBMECs infectadas com DENV apresentaram redução da respiração basal quando comparadas com as células controle (Figura 20 C -D). Como esperado, a inibição da ATP sintase pela adição de Oligomicina diminuiu , significativamente , a OCR das célula s controle (2,7 vezes, p<0.001). Por outro lado, a Oligomicina induziu uma diminuição sutil, não significativa, da OCR nas células infectadas (1,6 vezes, p=0.082). De fato, HBMECs infectadas com DENV apresentaram taxas semelhantes de consumo de oxigênio basal, acoplado ou desacoplado nesse período de tempo. Esse dado sugere que a respiração celular já estaria comprometida, possivelmente com perda de potencia l de membrana mitocondrial. Além disso, as HBMECs infectadas com DENV apresentam redução do consumo máximo induzido por FCCP (Figura 20) , o que reflete uma diminuição da capacidade máxima respiratória e da capacidade de reserva.

Quando a membrana mitocondrial está polarizada, a sonda se acumula e forma agregados, passando a emitir fluorescência no espectro vermelho. A despolarização mitocondrial é indicada pela diminuição na razão de intensidade da fluorescência vermelho/verde. Como podemos observar, o DENV induz a perda do potencial de membrana em HBMECs (Figura 20 E -F).

Reactive oxygen species (ROS) production has been associated to endothelial barrier disturbance and microv ascular alteration in d istinct pathological conditions. Increased ROS has been reported in in vitro models of dengue virus (DENV) infection, but its impact for endothelial cell physiology had not been fully investigated. Ourgroup had previously demonstrated that infection of human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMEC) with DENV results in the activation of RNA sensors andproduction of proin ﬂammatory cytokines, which culminate in cell death and endothelial permeability. Here, we evaluated the role of mitochondrial function and NADPH oxidase(NOX) activation for ROS generation in HBMEC infected by DENV and investigatedwhether altered cellular physiology could be a consequence of virus-induced oxidativestress. DENV-infected HBMECs showed a decrease in the maximal respiratory capacityand altered membrane potential, indicating functional mitochondrial alteration, what mightbe related to mtROS production. Indeed, mtROS was detected at later time points afterinfection. Speci ﬁc inhibition of mtROS diminished vi rus replication, cell death, and endothelial permeability, but did not affect cytokine production. On the other hand,inhibition of NOX-associated ROS product ion decreased virus replication and cell death, as well as the secretion of in ﬂammatory cytokines, including IL-6, IL-8, and CCL5. These results demonstrated that DENV replication in endothelial cells inducesROS production by different pathways, which impacts biological functions that might be Frontiers in Immunology | www.frontiersin.org February 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 810376 1Edited by: Francesca Chiodi, Karolinska Institutet (KI), Sweden Reviewed by:", "Maria Issagouliantis, Riga Stradin ¸sˇUniversity, Latvia Alexander V.

Infection by any of the four described serotypes can induce a range of clinical manifestations, from mild to severe hemorrhagic forms, thatcan be fatal ( 2). Vascular alterations, including vasodilation and increased permeability, are major consequences of DENVinfection, contributing to plasma extravasation to the tissues,hemorrhagic manifestations, and hypotension, which are hallmarks of severe disease, but may also happen at lower levels in mild and moderate disease ( 3,4). Previous studies indicated that vascular disturbances result from systemicinﬂammation and endothelial lesion ( 4–7). In addition, direct infection of endothelial cells was demonstrated inhistopathological analysis of different tissues from fatal cases, as well as in primary cells and different cell lines ( 7–11).", "We have previously demonstrated that human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMECs) are permissive to DENV, and virus replication triggers the activation of RNAsensors, inducing the production of in ﬂammatory cytokines, chemokines and type I interferon ( 9). Evidence of virus-induced cell death was also detected, but the involved mechanisms had not been addressed ( 9,12). A number of studies have been unraveling the complex connections between virus sensing, cellular stress response and cell death [rev in ( 13)]. Some of those signals converge to the production of nitrogen and oxygen reactivespecies, which accumulation stimulate the secretion ofinﬂammatory mediators, and trigger autophagy, apoptosis and necroptosis in different models of viral infections ( 14–18).", "Oxidative stress may be particularly deleterious in the vascularcontext, since ROS-mediated endothelial cell activation and deathwill contribute to vascular permeability and barrier disruption, asdemonstrated under several pathological conditions ( 19–21). Although it has been largely demonstrated that excessive ROSimpair microvessel integrity and that leukocyte-derived ROS might be an important contributor to endothelial barrier damage [rev in ( 21)], the role of endogenous endothelial cell- derived ROS has been poorly addressed, especially in the contextof virus infections. Increased ROS production was evidenced in in vitro and in vivo models of dengue infection. In vitro infection of human monocyte derived dendritic cells (Mo-DC) induced theactivation of NADPH oxidases (NOX) and accumulation ofintracellular ROS, which contribute to enhanced production ofinﬂammatory cytokines and chemokines ( 14). NOX-derived ROS was also associated to vascular damage in a mouseexperimental model, in which depletion of p47phoxsigniﬁcantly reduced DENV-induced systemic hemorrhage, in comparison to control mice ( 22).", "Mitochondrial oxidative phos phorylation metabolism is another major source of intracellular ROS ( 23,24). However, despite previous observation s of altered mitochondrial bioenergetics and morphology in in vitro experimental models of DENV infection, the impact of virus replication in thegeneration of mitochondrial-derived ROS (mtROS) had notbeen clearly addressed ( 25,26). In fact, cellular ROS may be generated by different enzymes present in distinct intracellularsites, also including xanthan oxygenase, cyclooxygenase andlipooxygenase, further contributing to overall oxidative stress(13,19,27). Here, we evaluated whether infection of HBMEC with DENV resulted in enhanced cellular ROS by NOX and mitochondrial- derived pathways and assessed the relative role of each ROS source for viral replication, endothelial activation, cell death andendothelium permeability. We observed that DENV replicationtriggered mitochondrial and NOX-mediated ROS production,which were essential for viral replication and cell death.Mitochondrial-derived ROS was a major inducer of HBMEC permeability, whereas NOX-derived ROS played a relevant role for endothelial activation and production of in ﬂammatory mediators. This study reveals new information about theimpact of oxidative stress caused by DENV during infection ofendothelial cells and provides a new perspective for the use ofantioxidants for dengue treatment.

RESULTS Infection of HBMEC With DENV-2 Induces ROS Production Through Different Pathways, Which Modulate Virus Replication Our group demonstrated that infection of HBMEC with DENV-", "2 induced RIG-I expression, cytokine production, and cell death", "(9,12). Since NOX-mediated R OS production has been associated to cellular activation and death upon DENVinfection in other cell models ( 14), here we investigated whether altered HBMEC biology could also be a consequenceof DENV-induced oxidative stress. HBMECs were infected with DENV-2, at a MOI of 1, and stained with CM-H2DCFDA probe at different time points until72 hours post infection (hpi). DENV infection stimulated ROSproduction at 48 and 72 hpi, in comparison to mock-treatedcells, which was evidenced by a signi ﬁcant increase in the frequency of cells producing higher ROS levels (% ROShi cells)and in the overall level of intracellular ROS in the culture (MFI) (Figures 1A –C). UV-inactivated virus (iDENV) did not affect ROS levels. Also, ROS production was not observed at earlier time points ( Figures S1A, B ), probably re ﬂecting the need for virus replication cycles to amplify the stimulatory signal. As acontrol, HBMECs were cultured with heme ( 34), which resulted in increased ROS production after 24h, indicating that there was no intrinsic impairment of the cultures at this time point (Figures S1C, D ). We evaluated the concentration of released infectious particles in the cultures (PFU) ( Figure 1D )a n d observed that ROS levels positively correlated with virus titerovertime ( Figure 1E ). This data was corroborated by immuno ﬂuorescence analyses, showing that the majority of DENV-2-infected cells were generating ROS ( Figure 1F ).", "In another set of experiments, HBMECs were stained with MitoSox probe to speci ﬁcally investigate mitochondrial-derived ROS. Increased mtROS were also detected in DENV-infectedcells from 48hpi, with a signi ﬁcant enhancement at 72hpi (Figures 1G –I).", "To identify the ROS-inducing pathway, HBMECs were infected in the presence or absence of apocynin ormitoTEMPO, to respectively inhibit NOX or scavenge mtROS.The antioxidant N-acetyl-L-cystein (NAC) was used as a control.Decreased ROS levels were observed when HBMECs werecultured with either apocynin or mitoTEMPO, indicating thatcytoplasmic and mitochondrial sources are important for ROSgeneration induced upon DENV-2 infection ( Figures 2A –C).

In addition, since apocynin may function as a ROS scavenger andnot as a speci ﬁc NOX inhibitor in some systems ( 35), we evaluated whether it could be in fact inhibiting mtROS. Theaddition of apocynin did not affect MitoSox staining, corroborating with the hypo thesis that DENV infection induces ROS generation by different sources in HBMECs (Figures 2D –F).", "Importantly, ROS scavenging by NAC resulted in diminished intracellular and released virus RNA ( Figure 2G ). Furthermore, addition of NAC, apocynin or mitoTEMPO to the cultures decreased the concentration of released DENV-2 infectious particles, indicating that DENV infection induces the productionof ROS, which further contribute to virus replication ( Figure 2H ). Interestingly, inhibition of released virus RNA and infectiousparticles were more pronounced, in comparison to intracellularRNA reduction, suggesting that ROS may affect later steps of DENV biosynthetic cycle, delaying virus replication.", "DENV-2 Infection of HBMEC Affects Mitochondrial Bioenergetics and Membrane Potential Virus infection and intracellular virus biosynthesis relies on enhanced energy spent, what may trigger increased respiration.Abnormal respiration may then result in increased electronleakage and generation of mtROS. Indeed, we had demonstratedthat infection of hepatic cell lines with DENV resulted in alteredmitochondrial bioenergetics and morphology and cell death ( 25). To evaluate mitochondrial function in DENV-2-infectedHBMECs, bioenergetic and membrane potential analyses wereperformed by high-resolution respirometry and ﬂow cytometry assays. HBMECs were mock-treated or infected with DENV-2for different periods, and oxygen consumption rate (OCR)was measured after sequentially adding pharmacologicalmodulators of the oxidative phosphorylation. We did not detect any alterations in mitochondrial bioenergetics at 24hpi (Figures 3A, B ). However, at 48hpi, we observed a signi ﬁcant decrease in the basal OCR in DENV-infected cells, in comparisonto the mock treated ones ( Figures 3C, D ). As expected, inhibition of ATP synthase through the addition of oligomycin stronglydiminished the OCR in the mock-treated cells (2.7 times, p<0.001). In contrast, oligomycin did not signi ﬁcantly affected the OCRs of the infected cells (1.6 times, p=0.082), which showed similar basal, coupled, and uncoupled values at this time point. Inaddition, DENV-2-infected cells presented a reduced maximumrespiratory capacity evidenced by the lower OCR detected afteraddition of the proton ionophore FCCP ( Figures 3C, D ). These data indicate that DENV induced mitochondrial membrane leak, detected by diminished basal OCR, which could not be further affected by the modulators of oxidative phosphorylation. Inaddition, cellular staining with JC1 dye indicated mitochondrialdepolarization after 48hpi ( Figures 3E, F ). Taken together, these ﬁndings suggest that DENV-2 impairs mitochondrial function and affects membrane potential, resulting in the increased mtROS, which was mostly detected at later time points upon infection.DENV-2-Induced ROS Production Promotes Cell Death and Endothelial Permeability Since DENV infection impacted HBMEC survival ( 9), and given that endothelial cell death would affect the endothelium permeability, we investigated whether ROS generation was also involved in these events. Analysis of propidium iodide staining at48 and 72hpi demonstrated that NAC, apocynin andmitoTEMPO partially reduced HBMECs death induced byDENV-2 infection ( Figures 4A, B ). We then evaluated whether endothelial permeability induced b yD E N V - 2w o u l da l s ob er e s t o r e db yr e d u c i n gR O Saccumulation. HBMECs were seed onto transwell inserts andinfected with DENV-2, with or without NAC, apocynin ormitoTEMPO, and transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER)was measured at 48 and 72hpi. At 72hpi, culture permeability wasalso accessed by measuring the extravasation FITC-conjugatedBSA through the transwell membrane. Mock and staurosporin (STS) were used as negative and positive controls, respectively. As expected, DENV-2 infection promoted a decrease in the TEER,associated to increased extravasation of BSA-FITC to the lowertranswell compartment ( Figures 4C, D ), demonstrating that DENV-2 induces permeability in this cell model. HBMECpermeability was completely rescued when the cells were treated with NAC or mitoTEMPO. Addition of apocynin resulted in increased TEER but did not signi ﬁcantly protect the monolayer from BSA extravasation, suggesting that mtROS might be a majormediator in DENV-2-induced endothelial permeability. To investigate whether these events were speci ﬁc to endothelial cells, we evaluated ROS production, virus replication, and cellviability after infection of primary human macrophages with DENV-2. DENV-infected macrophages also showed increased total and mtROS production as evidenced by staining with CM-H2DCFDA or MitoSox probes ( Figures S3A, B ). As observed for HBMEC, macrophage treatment with NAC resulted in diminishedvirus replication and cellular survival ( Figures S3C, D ), indicating that oxidative stress induced by DENV-2 infection might be essential for fueling virus replication, resulting in cell death.", "Apocynin-Modulated ROS, But Not mtROS, Is Essential for the Secretion of Inﬂammatory Cytokines Induced by DENV-2 Infection of HBMECs Given that HBMEC infection wit h DENV-2 promoted cellular activation ( 9) and since accumulation of intracellular ROS had been previously proposed to stimulate immune responses in other human cell types ( 14) ,w ei n v e s t i g a t e dw h e t h e rt h i ss t r e s sr e s p o n s e could also contribute to HBMEC activation.

Cytokine secretion was signi ﬁcantly inhibited by NAC and apocynin, but not by mitoTEMPO ( Figures 5A –C), indicating that other ROS sources, but not mtROS, contributes tosignal transduction associated to IL-6 and chemokine release.Surprisingly, increased IFN- bexpression induced by DENV-2 infection was not modulated by any inhibitors ( Figure 5D ).Meuren et al.

We have previouslydemonstrated that HBMECs are productively infected byDENV, resulting in prompt cellular activation and late celldeath ( 9), what might be associated to the increased vascular permeability. In this HBMEC model, we have now showed that DENV replication stimulated ROS generation, which depended on virus replication. It is important to notice, however, that mostof the probes available to measure ROS may eventually react withother species such reactive nitrogen species (RNS) ( 39).

Increased ROS may then act in a feedback loop, inducing the depolarization of membrane potential, and impairment of oxidative metabolism,potentiating mitochondrial damage ( 42,43). Interaction of viral proteins with mitochondrial membranes, leading todepolarization and increased permeability, has been largely described, and leakage of mitochondrial content was associated to apoptosis ( 44–46). Additionally, recruitment and activation of mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS) triggered bycytoplasmic sensing of virus RNA was also associated to celldeath in in vitro infection models ( 47). We had demonstrated that infection of hepatocytes with DENV as well as of neuroblastoma cells with Sindbis virusinduced altered mitochondrial bionenergetics ( 25,48). These events probably re ﬂect additional energy demands during virus replication with disruption of the energetic mitochondrial ﬂux.", "Increased ATP ﬂux might be necessary for ef ﬁcient virus replication, whereas sustained stress resulted in cell death ( 48). Despite possible antiviral effects of oxidative stress responses (49,50), we observed that ROS inhibition reduced DENV replication in HBMEC. Different mechanisms might explainthis phenomenon. Like our model, infection of A549 cells withRespiratory Syncytial Virus ( RSV) altered mitochondrial bioenergetics, evidenced by lower basal OCR and decreasedmaximal respiratory capacity. Enhanced ROS production was also detected and inhibition of ROS dampened virus replication (51,52). Taken together with other morphological and functional alterations detected in the mitochondria, one cansuggest that mitochondrial components might be coopted byviruses favoring their replication. Accordingly, HBMECtreatment with mitoTEMPO decreased the production of DENV infectious particles, indicating that mitochondrial dysfunction is also associated with viral replication in thissystem. Decreased effect of mitoTEMPO at later time pointsmay indicate that mtROS scavenging is hindering, but notpreventing virus replication. Supplementation of the cellculture with ROS inhibitors overtime could foster their effect.Still, more than 50% inhibition in the virus titers were detected at", "72hpi, even by adding mitoTEMPO only at the beginning of", "the culture.", "Increased ROS may also trigger autophagy, and subversion of autophagy machinery has been demonstrated to bene ﬁt viral replication in different infection models, including dengue ( 53, 54). Infection of monocytes with different ﬂaviviruses induced autophagy and this event was important to protect the cells fromother stress responses and early cell death. Early inhibition ofcellular stress contributed to virus replication ( 55). Accordingly, increased LC3/LC3II conversion and accumulation of p62 wasobserved in HBMECs infected with at 24hpi, but not at later timepoints (data not shown), suggesting that autophagy may be anearlier event conferring cell protection. These events will be further investigated. On the other hand, ROS-mediated cell death phenotype started to be detected at 48hpi, being signi ﬁcantly increased at 72hpi, suggesting that apoptotic or necroptic eventsare later triggered probably as a resulted of sustainedROS production.We could only detect signi ﬁcant ROS enhancement after 48hpi, what indicates that sequential virus replication cyclesmight be necessary to amplify the response. In fact, wepreviously observed that HBMEC infection with a MOI of 1resulted in about 30% of infected cells at early time points ( 9). Alternatively, earlier oxidative stress could be impaired by stimulation of antioxidant re sponses. DENV infection of monocytes derived dendritic cells (mo-DC) induced NOX- mediated late ROS response, which was also associated to celldeath in that model ( 14). It was also showed that Nrf2 antioxidant was increased at earlier time points, but it waslater degraded due to action of NS2BNS3 viral proteins, allowing ROS accumulation ( 16). Nrf2 depletion resulted in increased frequency of DENV infected cells, indicating thatROS was also important for virus replication in those cells. Besides fueling virus replication, NOX-dependent ROS production in Mo-DC resulted in activation of in ﬂammatory signals, with the production of IFN- b, IL-1band CCL5 ( 14,16).", "In our model, treatment of DENV-infected HBMEC withapocynin inhibited CCL5, IL-6, and IL-8 secretion, suggestingthat NOX-derived ROS may also take part in vascularinﬂammation induced by the virus. It is important to notice, however, that apocynin may not function as a bona ﬁdeNOX inhibitor in endothelial cells. Heumuller and colleaguesdescribed that porcine aortic endothelial cells (PAEC) might not express myeloperoxidase and failed to form apocynin dimers, which would be essential to its activation and NOX inhibition(35). In these cells, apocynin mostly functioned as a peroxidase scavenger. In another set of studies, using a HUVEC-derived cellfree system, it was demonstrated that addition of peroxidase tothe system was indeed important to form apocynin dimer and that those dimers induced a prompt and almost complete inhibition of O2- production. Still, apocynin monomers alsoresulted in decreased O2- production, although after a lagtime(56). It is important to point that previous studies addressing multiple effects of oxidative stress speci ﬁcally in HBMECs have reported that apocynin redu ced the activation of NADPH oxidases or, at least, NOX-dependent cellular dysfunction ( 57– 59), highlighting the complexit ya n dd i v e r s i t yo fv a s c u l a r endothelial models. Importantly, in DENV-infected HBMECmodel it was clearly demonstrated that apocynin-inhibitedROS, but not mtROS, was a major contributor to the secretionof inﬂammatory cytokines and chemokines. Therefore, although we had not fully elucidated the source of non mtROS, it is worth to mention that inhibition of ROS by apocynin might be a potential strategy to control DENV-induced in ﬂammation. It was previously demonstrated that cytoplasmic ROS may induceMAVS oligomerization, potentiating RIG-I-MAVS signalingpathway, independent of virus RNA sensing ( 60). Interestingly, IFN-bexpression was not affected by ROS inhibition, suggesting that ROS may differentially impact NF- kB and IRF signaling pathways, what should be further investigated.", "Cell death and NF-kB in ﬂammatory signaling pathways were also detected after infection of neuroblastoma cells with DENV(61). Given that the endothelial cells used in this study are a representative model of in vitro blood brain barrier (BBB), weMeuren et al. DENV-Induced ROS Impacts Endothelial Function Frontiers in Immunology | www.frontiersin.org February 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 810376 11 can speculate that when DENV achieves the BBB and the central nervous system, ROS production might contribute to virusinvasion and neuroin ﬂammation. Finally, DENV-induced ROS was important for increased endothelial permeability andmtROS appeared to be the major pathway, although inhibitionof NOX activation also increased the TEER. Taken together our data indicate that altered metabolism triggered by DENV replication results in ROS production fromdifferent cell sources, which is important for virus replication,endothelial activation, and increased permeability ( Figure 6 ). Further studies addressing the effect of antioxidants in vivo may contribute to avoid vascular permeability, in ﬂammation and neuroinvasion upon DENV infection.DATA AVAILABILITY STATEMENT The raw data supporting the conclusions of this article will bemade available by the authors, without undue reservation.

However, the mechanism by whic h the virus reaches the CNS is unclear. Here, we addressed the effects of ZIKV rep lication in human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMECs), as an in vitromodel of blood brain barrier (BBB), and evaluated virus extravasation and BBB in tegrity in an in vivo mouse experimental model. HBMECs were productively infect ed by African and Brazilian ZIKV strains (ZIKV MR766and ZIKV PE243), which induce increased production of type I and type III IFN, inﬂammatory cytokines and chemoki nes. Infection with ZIKVMR766promoted earlier cellular death, in comparison to ZIKV PE243, but infection with either strain did not result in enhanced endothelial pe rmeability. Despite the maintenance of endothelial integrity, infectious virus pa rticles crossed the monolayer by endocytosis/exocytosis-dependent replication pathway o r by transcytosis. Remarkably, both viruses’ strains infected IFNAR deﬁcient mice, with hi gh viral load being detected in the brains, without BBB disruption, which was only detect ed at later time points after infection.ThesedatasuggestthatZIKVinfectsandactivat esendothelialcells,andmight reach the CNS through basolateral release, transcytosis or transinfection processes.

Until 2007, few sporadic human cases had been reported in African and Southeast Asiatic countries, and were associated to mil d clinical manifestations. After human-associated ZIKV out breaks in Micronesia and Paciﬁc Islands in 2007 and 2013, the virus spread to the Americas, and has now been reported in more than 60 countries around the world ( Lanciotti et al., 2008; Cao- Lormeauetal.,2014;Fariaetal.,2016;WHO,2016 ).", "ZIKV circulation positively correlated with enormous increase in the number of cases of microcephaly, suggesting a causal association between ZIKV infection during pregnancy and neonatal microcephaly ( Calvet et al., 2016; Oliveira Melo et al., 2016; Rasmussen et al., 2016; Schuler-Faccini et al. , 2016). This was further supported by virus detection in the brains and in amniotic ﬂuid of fetuses with microcephaly by qRT-PCR, immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy (Calvet et al., 2016; Martines et al., 2016; Mlakar et al., 2016 ). Later on, ZIKV congenital transmission was associated to further fetal malformations, including several neurologi cal manifestations, which are now described as congenital Zika syndrome (CZS) ( Miranda-Filho et al., 2016; Lucey et al., 2017). Meningoencephalitis was also reported in ZIKV-infected adult patients and during experimental infection of rhesus monkeys, and the viral RNA was detected in their cerebrospinal ﬂuid (Carteaux et al., 2016; Dudley et al., 2016 ). These lines of evidence suggest that virus replication may be, eventuall y, associatedtoinvasionofcentralnervoussystem(CNS).", "In spite of multiple sources of evidence indicating that ZIKV penetrates CNS, the mechanism associated to this inﬁltratio n is unknown. Neurotropic viruses may access the brain by either neural or hematogenic pathways; in the latter case, viruses o r virus-infected cells must cross the blood brain barrier (BB B) (Salinas et al., 2010; Luethy et al., 2016 ). BBB is a dynamic structureofspecializedcellsthatlimitsthepassageofcirc ulating molecules and cells to the brain, and restricts the entry of pathogens, including viruses or virus-infected cells to the CNS.", "Brain microvascular endothelial cells are the most prominen t cell type, responsible for this control, acting in concert wit h astrocytes, microglia, pericytes, and neurons ( Ballabh et al., 2004; Miner and Diamond, 2016 ). Disruption of the BBB, commonly due to increased endothelial cell permeability, is a hallmark of CNS infections and can be induced by virus replication or neuroinﬂammation ( Daniels and Klein, 2015 ).", "Alternatively, it was suggested that increased BBB permeabi lity might not be essential for lethal disease induced by another ﬂavivirus infection model ( Morrey et al., 2008 ). Infection and activation of endothelial cells in the retina and placenta of ZIKA experimental models have been previously observed ( Noronha et al., 2016; Singh et al., 2017; Vermillion et al., 2017 ); however, the role of the virus replication in endothelial cell for viru sdissemination or extravasation to other tissues has not bee n addressed.", "Two diﬀerent ZIKV lineages have been epidemiologically characterized, named African and Asian, the latter being associated to the epidemic outbreak in Brazil ( Calvet et al., 2016; Weaver et al., 2016; Zhu et al., 2016 ). It was recently demonstrated that ZIKV infects human brain microvascular endothelial cells, which is a model of BBB tissue ( Bayer et al., 2016; Mladinich et al., 2017 ). HBMECs infection by ZIKV was associatedtoapersistentinfectionwithnoevidencesofinc reased permeability in vitro(Mladinich et al., 2017 ). Nevertheless, the eﬀect of diﬀerent ZIKV strains, obtained from mosquitoes and mammal cells, in HBMECs survival, activation and permeabilit y worth to be further addressed and compared. Importantly, it is still not established whether a systemic infection wit h ZIKVin vivomay promote virus extravasation and infection of CNS. Here, we described that diﬀerent strains of ZIKV productively infect HBMECs and induce cell activation, with increased production of type I and type III IFN, IL-6, and CCL5, conﬁrming previous data obtained with a diﬀerent strain (Mladinich et al., 2017 ). HBMEC infection with either virus did notresultinsigniﬁcantdisruptionofthemonolayerpermeabi lity.", "Still, infectious virus crossed the endothelial monolayer through replication and transcytosis dependent pathways. Remarkably, infection of A129 mice with either virus strain did not resul t in BBB permeability at early time points after infection, althoug h high viral load had been detected in the brain. Subtle BBB alteration was detected at later time points post infection, which might be a result of a virus-induced inﬂammatory response.ThesedatasuggestthatZIKVviruscrossBBBthroug h transcytosis or transinfection after endothelial cell infe ction and activation.", "MATERIALS AND METHODS Ethical Statements Blood samples (buﬀy coats) from healthy donors were obtained anonymously from the Hemotherapy Service from the Hospital UniversitárioClementinoFragaFilho(HUCFF)ofUniversidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ).

Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), West Nile virus (WNV), Zika virus (ZIKV), yellow fever virus (YFV), dengue virus (DENV), and tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) are believed to reach the central nervous system by a hematogenous route, upon crossing the blood-brain barrier. Although the disruption of BBB during flavivirus infection has been largely evidenced in experimental models, the relevance of BBB breakdown for virus entering the brain was not completely elucidated. In vitro models of BBB had demonstrated that these viruses replicated in brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs), which induced downregulation of tight junction proteins and increased the permeability of the barrier. Other reports demonstrated that infection of BMECs allowed the basolateral release of infectious particles, without a remarkable cytopathic effect, what might be sufficient for virus invasion. Virus replication and activation of other cells associated to the BBB, mostly astrocytes and microglia, were also reported to affect the endothelial barrier permeability. This event might occur simultaneously or after BMECs infection, being a secondary effect leading to BBB disruption. Importantly, activation of BMECs, astrocytes, and microglia by flaviviruses was associated to the expression and secretion of inflammatory mediators, which are believed to recruit leukocytes to the CNS. The leukocyte infiltrate could further mediate viral invasion through a Trojan horse mechanism and might contribute to BBB breakdown and to neurological alterations. This review discussed the previous studies regarding in vitro and in vivo models of JEV, WNV, ZIKV, YFV, DENV, and TBEV infection and addressed the pathways for BBB overcome and invasion of the CNS described for each virus infection, aiming to increment the knowledge and stimulate further discussion about the role of BBB in the neuropathogenesis of flavivirus infection.", "Keywords: blood-brain barrier, flavivirus, Japanese encephalitis virus, West Nile virus, Zika virus, dengue virus, yellow fever virus, brain microvascular endothelial cells Mustafá et al. Blood-Brain Barrier Overcome by FlavivirusesFrontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org 2 March 2019 | Volume 10 | Article 525INTRODUCTION Flaviviruses encompass arthropod transmitted viruses, which may cause systemic, hemorrhagic, and neurological syndromes.", "Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), West Nile virus (WNV), Zika virus (ZIKV), yellow fever virus (YFV), dengue virus (DENV), and tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) are some of the most prevalent flaviviruses associated to human diseases in different regions of the world. Most of the individuals affected by those infections develop asymptomatic or mild manifestations, but these viruses may cause severe neurologic syndromes, once they reach the central nervous system (CNS).", "The frequency of neurological manifestations upon flavivirus infection varies considerably depending on the virus. Severe infection by JEV , WNV , TBEV , and congenital ZIKV is associated to encephalitis and other neurological syndromes ( Lindquist and Vapalahti, 2008 ; Melo et  al., 2016 ; Salimi et  al., 2016 ; Samy et al., 2018 ), whereas the severe disease caused by DENV and YFV are more related to vascular and systemic manifestations (Jennings et  al., 1994 ; Monath and Barrett, 2003 ; Beck and Barrett, 2015 ; Halstead and Cohen, 2015 ; Screaton et  al., 2015 ; Li et  al., 2017 ). Even though these viruses usually do not affect the CNS, a recent surveillance study performed in Brazil reported the presence of laboratory markers of DENV and ZIKV in patients with acute neurological diseases. Among 74 studied cases, 2 patients presented DENV RNA in the CSF and 6 patients showed anti-DENV IgM in the serum. Also, three patients showed ZIKV RNA or IgM in the CSF or in the serum. These data suggest that arboviruses may play a more important role in CNS-associated disease than previously found, at least in endemic countries where the number of infected individuals is very high ( Vieira et  al., 2018 ).", "All the referred viruses are able to infect neurons, albeit they are not always neuroinvasive ( Jennings et al., 1994 ; Ramos et  al., 1998 ; Chen et  al., 2012 ; Hussmann et  al., 2013 ; Garcez et  al., 2016 ). Viruses can reach the brain through different mechanisms, including peripheral nervous system and axonal transport, and hematogenous route. Although experimental models had previously indicated that some flaviviruses, such as WNV and JEV , disseminated via axonal transport or through the olfactory bulb, those models were developed using intrasciatic and intranasal inoculation ( Samuel et  al., 2007 ; Y amada et  al., 2009 ), which may not represent their natural infection route.", "Given the systemic nature of flavivirus infection, and since a disruption of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is often observed in experimental models of infection, it is believed that crossing this structure is a major mechanism for flavivirus neuroinvasion (Verma et  al., 2010 ; Jurado et  al., 2018 ; Wang et  al., 2018 ). The BBB is a complex structure, composed by tightly adhered brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs), which are associated to pericytes, astrocytes, and microglia. This structure constitutes a barrier between the blood and the CNS parenchyma, acting in the flux regulation of solutes, cells, and pathogens (Figure 1A ; Ballabh et  al., 2004 ). The cells associated to the BBB express a collection of pattern recognition receptors (PRR) and are able to respond to PAMPs derived from pathogens and to DAMPs released upon CNS damage ( Zamanian et  al., 2012 ; da Conceição et  al., 2013 ; Minkiewicz et  al., 2013 ; Wan et  al., 2014 ). Therefore, an inflammatory insult or other pathobiological conditions that affect their metabolism may impact the barrier function ( Argaw et  al., 2012 ; Sofroniew, 2015 ).", "BMECs are unique unfenestrated polarized endothelial cells, connected by continuous tight junctions (TJs). The junctions are composed of TJ proteins – claudins and occludin, and of adhesion molecules – E- and VE-cadherins. The TJ complex is stabilized by its association to intracellular cytoskeleton through adaptor proteins, such as zonula occludens (ZO), among others ( Chow and Gu, 2015 ). Those features, in association to the low rate vesicular trafficking of the brain endothelial cells, turn them more resistant to paracellular and transcellular trafficking, in comparison to endothelial cells from other tissues (Obermeier et  al., 2013 ; Siegenthaler et  al., 2013 ; Chow and Gu, 2015 ). In addition, BMECs express low levels of leukocyte adhesion molecules, limiting the infiltration of immune cells into the brain ( Siegenthaler et  al., 2013 ). Virus infection of BMECs may result in cell death or in decreased expression and organization of TJ proteins, directly impacting the integrity of the endothelial monolayer. The activation of the BMECs due to virus replication may also promote the production of mediators that affect the BBB structure and stimulate leukocyte recruitment, including cytokines, such as IL-6 and TNF- α, reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS, NO), and prostaglandins (Schreibelt et  al., 2007 ; da Conceição et  al., 2013 ; Rochfort BBB endothelial cells are surrounded by the basement membrane, and the structure and function of this core are supported and regulated by adjacent pericytes, astrocytes, and microglia ( Chow and Gu, 2015 ). Astrocytes endfeet covers most of the CNS vasculature, connecting it to the neuronal parenchyma. Therefore, mediators produced upon BMEC activation or after CNS damage affect the function of astrocytes. Also, these cells may be  directly infected and activated by viruses ( Hussmann et  al., 2013 ; Chang et  al., 2015 ). All the cited stimuli promote a response called astrogliosis, and reactive astrocytes produce cytokines, chemokines, prostaglandins, and nitric oxide ( Argaw et al., 2012 ; Zamanian et al., 2012 ; Sofroniew, 2015 ). These mediators modulate angiogenesis, affect TJ proteins expression and organization, restrict or stimulate leukocyte infiltration, and impact neuronal function.", "Hence, insults like virus infection and inflammation can stimulate BMECs, astrocytes, and other cells to secrete mediators that will ultimately affect the BBB integrity and CNS function (Fabry et al., 1995 ; Argaw et al., 2012 ; Heinemann et al., 2012 ; Alvarez et  al., 2013 ).", "Given the systemic nature of flavivirus infection and the physiological function of the BBB, it is generally believed that BBB disruption is a determinant event preceding viral invasion.", "A major point supporting this conception is that BMECs, which are the main cell types in the BBB and are susceptible to all neurotropic flaviviruses. Virus replication often induces apoptosis, and several studies suggested that neuroinvasion involved infection of BMECs ( Wang et al., 2008a ,b; Verma et al., 2009 ; da Conceição et  al., 2013 ; Lazear et  al., 2015 ; Al-Obaidi et  al., 2017 ; Papa et  al., 2017 ; Patabendige et  al., 2018 ). It is important to notice, Mustafá et al. Blood-Brain Barrier Overcome by FlavivirusesFrontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org 3 March 2019 | Volume 10 | Article 525 A BC D FIGURE 1 | Schematic figure showing possible mechanism of virus entry into the central nervous system through the blood-brain barrier. (A) Intact blood-brain barrier is composed by endothelial cell strongly adhered through tight junction proteins (TJP), in association to pericytes, astrocytes, and microglia. The barrier controls the flux of solutes, blood cells (lymphocytes, monocytes, and polymorphonuclear cells), and pathogens from the blood to the central nervous system. (B) After systemic infection, some flavivirus reaches the BBB through hematogenous route and may cross the endothelial barrier without remarkable cytopathic effect. JEV, WNV, ZIKV, and TBEV may cross the endothelial barrier as cell-free virus (1). JEV, WNV, and ZIKV were also reported to traverse the endothelial barrier associated to infected leukocytes (2). (C) Systemic infection and inflammation and/or the direct infection of brain endothelial cells may induce BBB breakdown, allowing virus invasion of the CNS. Regarding this, systemic inflammation due to activation of immune cells upon infection was associated to the release of inflammatory mediators, which then affect the permeability of the endothelial barrier (3). Also, replication of JEV, WNV, and DENV in the brain endothelial cells may induce downregulation of TJP expression (4) and/or cell death (5), promoting the barrier disruption and virus entry. (D) After entry into the brain by any of the described pathways (B and C), flaviviruses may infect the astrocytes (as described for JEV, WNV, YFV, TBEV) (6), microglia (as described for JEV, DENV, ZIKV) (7), pericytes (as described for JEV) (8), and neurons (as described for WNV, ZIKV, TBEV) (9). The infection of these cells, especially astrocytes and microglia, induces the release of inflammatory mediators (IL-6, VEGF, TNF- α, IFN- γ, IL-1 β and IL-10, MCP-1) and metalloproteinases (MMP2, MMP3, MM9) (10), which mediate the downregulation of adherents and tight junction proteins (TJP), resulting in increased permeability. Mustafá et al. Blood-Brain Barrier Overcome by FlavivirusesFrontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org 4 March 2019 | Volume 10 | Article 525however, that due to technical issues inherent to analysis of brain tissues, there are very few studies confirming the infection of BMECs upon human natural infection ( Johnson et  al., 1985 ; Ramos et  al., 1998 ). The great majority of the studies were done in vitro , with transformed cell lines ( da Conceição et  al., 2013 ; Patabendige et  al., 2018 ). Also, since wild-type adult mice were resistant to infection, most of the studies performed in vivo used immunodeficient or suckling mice ( Velandia-Romero et  al., 2012 ; Daniels et  al., 2017 ; Papa et  al., 2017 ). Therefore, although flavivirus replication in BMEC has been largely demonstrated in experimental models, further analyses of human tissues are critical to further support this hypothesis.", "Increasing evidence suggest that flaviviruses can also reach the CNS by crossing the BBB, without barrier breakdown. The basolateral release of infectious particles upon virus replication in BMECs was described in different experimental models, in which no significant cytopathic effect (CPE) had been detected (Verma et al., 2009 ; Papa et al., 2017 ). Virus crossing by transcytosis in brain endothelial cells had also been reported ( Liou and Hsu, 1998 ; Papa et  al., 2017 ) and may allow free virus to reach and infect the neurons. Flavivirus may also reach the CNS as cell- associated particles, through a mechanism called “Trojan horse” (Verma et al., 2009 ). In this context, peripheral-infected leukocytes transmigrate through the endothelial cell layer and release virus within the CNS. The released infectious particles can then infect resident cells. In healthy conditions, the BBB restricts leukocyte infiltration. Therefore, virus invasion through a Trojan horse mechanism requires either a rupture in the BBB structure or alterations of the TJ that allows paracellular migration of the cells. Activation of brain endothelial cells, with increased expression of adhesion receptors and enhanced secretion of chemokines, is also required to attract the infected leukocytes to the brain.", "Viral invasion of CNS by all these mechanisms is often followed by leukocyte infiltration. Both virus replication in neurons and the local inflammatory response triggered afterward were reported to be  relevant in the neuropathogenesis of flavivirus infection ( Roe et  al., 2012 ; Velandia-Romero et  al., Lucas et al., 2018 ; Wang et al., 2018 ). Subsequent inflammation elicited after virus invasion of the CNS may also contribute to BBB breakdown and amplify the whole process.", "In this review, we will address whether the flaviviruses such as JEV , WNV , ZIKV , YFV , DENV , and TBEV infect BMECs and whether this infection is relevant for the release of infectious particles, able to disseminate through the CNS, and for the disruption of BBB. We  will also consider if the infection of other cell types associated to the BBB, such as pericytes, astrocytes, and microglia, triggers cellular activation and the role of this secondary effect for BBB disruption. Finally, we will discuss whether BBB disruption is indeed essential for virus dissemination into the brain.", "JAPANESE ENCEPHALITIS VIRUS Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) is an important virus agent causing neuropathological disorders in Asia, Australia, and Western Pacific ( Samy et al., 2018 ). Although most individuals infected by JEV present subclinical or febrile mild infection, a small proportion of patients develop encephalitis or meningoencephalitis, which is often fatal or may lead to permanent motor or cognitive deficits ( Salimi et  al., 2016 ).", "Neuroinfection is characterized by disruption of the BBB and extensive inflammation in the brain ( Bian et  al., 2017 ; Wang et  al., 2018 ). However, the pathway of JEV entry into the CNS and mechanisms associated to the inflammatory response are not completely elucidated.", "JEV is able to infect a variety of cell types present in the BBB, including BMECs, microglia, astrocytes, and pericytes, and in vitro infection models have been exploring the effect of viral replication on BBB permeability ( Chen et  al., 2012 , 2014 ; Chang et  al., 2015 ). Infection of BMECs by JEV did not affect cell viability but resulted in increased permeability of the endothelial monolayer ( Lai et  al., 2012 ; Al-Obaidi et  al., 2017 ; Patabendige et  al., 2018 ), suggesting that virus-induced cell death is not the mechanism responsible for BBB disruption and viral invasion. Accordingly, JEV infection of multiple cell types diminished the expression and altered the localization of adherents and tight junction proteins. This effect was also observed when the cells were cultured with virus capsids, instead of infectious particles, suggesting that altered endothelial permeability may happen even in the absence of productive viral replication ( Agrawal et  al., 2013 ).", "Other studies, however, reported that JEV infection promoted negligible effect on transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER) of rat-derived isolated BMEC, unless they were cultured with other cell types associated to the BBB ( Chen et  al., 2014 ; Chang et al., 2015 ). Among those cells, pericytes and astrocytes are both permissive to JEV replication. Infection of these cells, in vitro , induced the release of soluble mediators that degrade tight junction proteins, particularly zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) (Chen et  al., 2014 ; Chang et  al., 2015 ). Indeed, addition of pericytes or conditioned medium derived from infected pericytes to a culture of BMECs induced endothelial permeability, in a pathway partially dependent on secreted proteases and IL-6 (Chen et al., 2014 ). Similarly, culture of BMECs with conditioned medium obtained from JEV-infected astrocytes induced the degradation of ZO-1 and claudin-5 and BMEC permeability, in a way dependent on IL-6, VEGF, and metalloproteinases An in vitro model of human BBB, using human BMECs (HBMECs) and astrocyte cell lines, also demonstrated that both cell types were susceptible to JEV ( Patabendige et  al., 2018 ). The interaction of endothelial cells with astrocytes was necessary for JEV-induced BBB permeability, and it was associated to increased secretion of inflammatory cytokines. Microglial cells were also activated upon JEV infection in vitro and produced inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), IL-1 β, IL-6, MCP-1, and TNF- α (Thounaojam et  al., 2014 ), what may contribute to endothelial barrier dysfunction. According to these studies, JEV-induced BBB breakdown seems to be  rather a bystander event than to direct virus replication in BMECs.", "However, JEV interaction with the endothelial cells could initiate the process, by allowing virus access to pericytes, astrocytes, Mustafá et al. Blood-Brain Barrier Overcome by FlavivirusesFrontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org 5 March 2019 | Volume 10 | Article 525and microglia, which would, then, secrete mediators that degrade the tight junctions and disrupt the barrier.", "Mouse and primate in vivo experimental models supported that JEV infection promoted BBB breakdown, leukocyte infiltration, and activation of astrocytes and microglia ( Myint et  al., 2014 ; Li et  al., 2015 ; Wang et  al., 2018 ). BBB disruption due to decreased expression of ZO-1 and claudin-5 was detected in JEV-infected mice at the time point when neuropathological syndrome was evident ( Li et  al., 2015 ; Wang et  al., 2018 ). In addition, the presence of activated astrocytes and microglia and a robust production of inflammatory cytokines, including TNF- α, IL-6, CCL5, CXCL10, IFN- γ, and CCL2, were detected in the brains of JEV-infected mice ( Li et  al., 2015 ; Bian et  al., 2017 ; Patabendige et  al., 2018 ; Wang et  al., 2018 ).", "It was also reported that cultivation of an endothelial cell line with brain extracts obtained from JEV-infected mice downregulated the expression of tight junction proteins. In contrast, infection of isolated endothelial cells with JEV did not alter their expression or cell permeability ( Li et  al., 2015 ). These data corroborated the hypothesis that infection of endothelial cells per se was not responsible for BBB breakdown.", "Indeed, other findings suggested that the inflammatory response triggered after viral dissemination to CNS promoted BBB permeability and consequent neurological syndrome. First, JEV-infected mice presented virus RNA in the brain from 2 days post infection (dpi), whereas significant BBB disruption was only observed after 4 dpi ( Li et  al., 2015 ). Also, treatment of infected mice with neutralizing anti-IFN- γ or anti-CXCL10 antibodies preserved the BBB integrity, with no significant effect on the brain viral load ( Li et  al., 2015 ; Wang et  al., 2018 ). Importantly, BBB breakdown was only detected in the mice that developed severe symptoms. These findings support that JEV can reach the CNS independent of BBB disruption, but subsequent events disturb the barrier, which might be  a major event related to neurological disease.", "Although JEV replication in the brain endothelial cells does not appear to be a major event for virus neuroinvasion, it might be  relevant for the subsequent inflammation in the CNS in vivo. JEV infection of BMECs promoted the expression of adhesion molecules and secretion of chemokines, enhancing leukocytes adhesion ( Lai et  al., 2012 ). However, it should be  noticed that leukocyte infiltration is not always deleterious to the host. In this sense, the presence of activated CD8+ T cells in the brains of JEV-infected mice was associated with lower mortality and preservation of the BBB integrity ( Jain et al., 2017 ). Therefore, the profile of activated immune cells that cross the BBB and reach the brain might determine disease outcome.", "WEST NILE VIRUS West Nile virus (WNV) was first isolated in 1937  in Uganda, and during several decades, it was associated to occasional outbreaks in Africa and in the Middle East. Since the decade of 1990, WNV spread to different countries in Europe and Americas, especially United  States, and it is now considered one of the most geographically widespread arboviruses in the world. It is estimated that around 80% of the infections are subclinical and most of the symptomatic patients will develop what is called West Nile fever. However, a small proportion of the infected individuals may develop a severe or neuroinvasive disease, leading to encephalitis and meningitis ( Sejvar et  al., 2003 ).", "There are some hypotheses for WNV neuroinvasion, including the hematogenous and the transneural routes ( Suen et  al., 2014 ), and increasing evidence indicate that WNV entry into the CNS is a multistep process employing different mechanism as the infection progresses. Here, we  will focus in the studies evaluating CNS invasion after systemic inoculation, which supports the hematogenous pathway of virus entry.", "The role of BBB disruption for WNV neuroinvasion and infection-mediated neuropathology is controversial. Several reports demonstrated that WNV infects brain endothelial cells, astrocytes, and neuron cells ( Dai et  al., 2008 ; Verma et  al., 2010 ; Hussmann et  al., 2013 ). Direct infection of BMECs induced degradation of tight junction proteins, in a pathway apparently dependent on their endocytosis and lysosomal degradation ( Xu et  al., 2012 ). Although endothelial barrier permeability was not directly addressed in this model, disorganization of tight junctions was proposed as a mechanism of BBB disruption and neuroinvasiveness. Other studies, however, indicated that direct infection of BMECs did not result in increased permeability. It is then proposed that viral invasion and neurovirulence are a more complex multistep process involving virus replication in different cell types, along with systemic and neuronal inflammation.", "Verma et  al. (2009) used an in vitro model of BBB, composed of primary HBMEC infected with the neurovirulent strain of WNV (NY99), and they observed that cell-free WNV crossed the endothelial barrier without affecting its integrity. Increased expression of the adhesion molecules VCAM-1 and E-selectin was observed at the peak of WNV replication, suggesting that the infection of endothelial cells might facilitate the migration of leukocytes ( Verma et  al., 2009 ). Infiltrating leukocytes could be later associated to virus entry into the brain via “Trojan horse” mechanism. Another study demonstrated that WNV virus-like particles (VLPs) were able to cross human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) from the apical to the basolateral sides, suggesting that transendothelial migration of WNV may occur independent of viral replication ( Hasebe et  al., 2010 ). Comparison between VLPs from high and low virulent strains demonstrated that the first presented a higher migration efficiency in comparison to the latter. ZO-1 expression and endothelial permeability were not altered during VLP transport, and transendothelial migration was inhibited by filipin ( Hasebe et  al., 2010 ). These data support the hypothesis that WNV crosses the blood endothelial barrier, in a pathway dependent of raft-associated membrane transport, that causes no direct effect on the barrier integrity. However, this study was performed with HUVECs, and the findings need to be  confirmed in brain endothelial cells.", "In order to further understand the neuroinvasive differences observed between WNV strains, Hussmann et al. (2013) compared the infection rate of an avirulent WNV lineage (MAD78 strain) to a highly virulent lineage (New Y ork strain), in neurons, astrocytes, and microvascular endothelial cells. Both strains Mustafá et al. Blood-Brain Barrier Overcome by FlavivirusesFrontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org 6 March 2019 | Volume 10 | Article 525replicated efficiently in neurons and BMECs. Also, similar levels of infectious particles were detected in the luminal and abluminal chambers of a transwell system with infected BMECs. Thus, the ability of WNV to infect the endothelial cells and to cross the BBB might not be  the main responsible for the differential neuroinvasiveness of the virus strains. This diverges with the data obtained with VLP ( Hasebe et al., 2010 ); however, different strains and distinct endothelial cell lines were used in the referred studies. Alternatively, the differences detected with VLPs from distinct strains might be overcome during a productive infection. In the study from Hussmann, the low virulent strain replicated less efficiently in astrocytes, exhibiting a delay in viral genome synthesis and reduced cell-to-cell spread in this cell type. Furthermore, in a transwell system in which infected HBMECs were seed in the luminal chamber, with astrocytes cultured in the abluminal one, there was significant lower virus expression in the astrocytes, indicating that these cells could restrain virus spread within the CNS ( Hussmann et  al., 2013 ).", "On the other hand, astrocyte activation seems to participate in the rupture of BBB observed during infection. Verma et  al.", "(2010 ) demonstrated that infection of HBCA astrocyte cell line with WNV upregulated the expression of MMP-1, -3, and -9 along with a downregulation of TIMP-2. Culture of microvascular endothelial cells with supernatants obtained from WNV-infected HBCA diminished the expression of claudin and ZO-1 and increased the permeability of in vitro BBB ( Verma et al., 2010 ). All these events were reversed by previous treatment of the supernatants with MMP inhibitors, corroborating the idea that WNV-induced production of MMPs by astrocytes may disrupt the barrier, even when the endothelial cells are not infected.", "The relevance of BBB breakdown for virus invasion of CNS, neurovirulence, and lethality of WNV in vivo is also controversial. Morrey et  al. (2008 ) and Wang et  al. (2004 ) demonstrated an increased permeability of the BBB upon WNV infection of C57BL/6 mice. In contrast, infection of BALB/c mice did not induce BBB permeability, despite leading to death ( Morrey et  al., 2008 ). Those data indicated that WNV entry in the CNS might be  independent of BBB breakdown, although viral load in the brains had not been accessed in this model. The hypothesis that BBB permeability may be  a consequence and not a cause of the virus entry in the CNS was supported by other in vivo study with C57BL/6 mice. In this model, BBB disruption upon WNV infection occurred along the course of infection and not prior to the entry of CNS. BBB breakdown resulted from decreased expression of tight and adherent junction proteins (claudin-1, occludin, ZO-1, and JAM-A; β-catenin and VE-cadherin) and correlated with the peak of WNV titers, increased production of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), and leukocyte infiltration in the brain ( Roe et  al., 2012 ).", "Importantly, intracranial inoculation of WNV also induced increased MMP expression and BBB permeability, suggesting that BBB breakdown could be  induced by virus replication into the brain ( Roe et  al., 2012 ).", "Mice deficient in MMP9 expression (MMP9−/− KO mice) were more resistant to infection, in comparison to WT mice, despite presenting equivalent viremia and similar levels of inflammatory cytokines and IFN- α in the circulation. However, MMP9−/− animals presented lower viral load in the brains, accompanied by less BBB permeability, less leukocyte infiltrates, and decreased levels of cytokines in this tissue ( Wang et  al., 2008a ). It is important to notice that despite high viremia, no detectable permeability of the BBB was observed at early time points after infection.", "Clear BBB breakdown was only detected at late time points, when brain viral titer was already high ( Wang et  al., 2008a ), indicating that virus invasion preceded BBB disruption. These findings and the in vitro transwell data support the hypothesis that WNV can migrate through the endothelial cells, what may allow the infection of astrocytes. Astrocytes could be  then the cell source of MMP , leading to subsequent BBB breakdown and neuropathology.", "Besides or along with virus replication in endothelial brain barrier, leukocyte recruitment appears to be  an important event associated to BBB disruption and viral neurovirulence.", "As previously described, infection of endothelial cell lines with WNV induced increased expression of adhesion molecules (Dai et al., 2008 ; Roe et al., 2014 ). Lymphocytes and monocytes showed efficient adhesion and migration through a monolayer of WNV-infected HBMECs. Also, the treatment of WNV-infected endothelial cells with anti-ICAM or anti-VCAM neutralizing antibodies abolished leukocyte adhesion and migration and resulted in decreased endothelial permeability (Roe et  al., 2014 ). Infection of C57BL/6 mice with WNV NY strain also resulted in increased expression of ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and E-selectin in the brain ( Dai et al., 2008 ). ICAM- deficient mice showed similar systemic viral load and inflammatory cytokine levels, in comparison to WT mice.", "However, ICAM-1−/− mice presented decreased BBB permeability, with lower leukocyte infiltration, diminished brain viral load and neuronal damage, and increased survival, in comparison to WT mice ( Dai et  al., 2008 ).", "According to the referred data, it is tempted to speculate that WNV infection of BMECs might be  a first essential event occurring after viremia that allows virus transmigration into the CNS. BMEC infection also induced an increased expression of adhesion molecules and production of chemokines, which could contribute to the recruitment of monocytes, lymphocytes, and polymorphonuclear cells to the barrier. The detection of augmented MMP9 expression in the brains after virus replication (Wang et  al., 2008a ) suggests that subsequent virus infection of other cell types may trigger a secondary BBB disruption that then allows leukocyte infiltration. The latter event would contribute for further virus invasion through a Trojan horse mechanism. This idea is supported by recent mouse experimental data showing that cerebral osteopontin stimulated the infiltration of WNV-infected neutrophils, leading to increased viral burden in the brain and mortality ( Paul et  al., 2017 ). Also, virus proteins were detected in the lymphocytes from the brain of WNV-infected mice, suggesting that infiltrating T cells might be  a source of virus entering the CNS following a systemic infection ( Wang et  al., 2008b ).", "The relevance of the systemic immune response to later BBB breakdown and virus invasion was also sustained by an earlier article accessing the role of innate immune activation for WNV neural disease. The study demonstrated that Mustafá et al. Blood-Brain Barrier Overcome by FlavivirusesFrontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org 7 March 2019 | Volume 10 | Article 525TLR3-deficient mice showed lower levels of IL-6, TNF- α, and type I  IFN in the blood and in the brains. TLR3-deficient mice were protected from BBB breakdown, viral invasion, leukocyte infiltration, and lethality ( Wang et al., 2004 ), indicating that systemic inflammation was determinant for virus dissemination. After that, several studies have been investigating the role of different elements of innate immune response in the protection or enhancement of WNV neurovirulence. It was reported that signal transduction mediated by type III or type I  IFN receptors was important for the maintenance of BBB integrity and for controlling WNV neuroinvasion (Lazear et  al., 2015 ; Miner et  al., 2015 ; Daniels et  al., 2017 ). In vitro infection of different cell types demonstrated that IFN- λ addition or depletion did not significantly affect WNV replication. Still, systemic WNV infection of mice deficient in IFN- λ receptor (Ifnlr1−/−) resulted in higher virus concentration in the brain and spinal cord, despite similar viral load in the blood, spleen and other systemic tissues ( Lazear et  al., 2015 ). The only difference detected between WT and Ifnlr1−/− mice was an increased BBB permeability in the latter. In addition, using a transwell model of BBB, it was demonstrated that IFNLR signal in BMEC increased barrier resistance. These data indicated that, although IFN- λ did not inhibit virus replication in vitro or in vivo , it increased barrier integrity and protected mice from the neurological effects caused by WNV infection. Importantly, no difference of brain viral load was detected upon intracerebroventricular inoculation of Ifnlr1−/− mice with WNV , supporting the idea that the major protective role of IFN- λ was the maintenance of the barrier strength.", "Type I IFN signaling pathway was also reported to be pivotal for the maintenance of BBB integrity, at least in experimental models. Daniels et  al. (2014 ) demonstrated that addition of type I  IFN to an in vitro culture of murine BMEC infected with WNV preserved BBB integrity and tight junction organization and reduced viral traffic through the endothelial monolayer. Also, BMECs obtained from ifnar−/− mice exhibited a significant reduction in TEER and increased secretion of TNF- α and IL-1 β upon WNV infection in vitro . It was then suggested that type I  IFN might regulate the transendothelial trafficking of WNV by restraining the BBB permeability induced by those cytokines ( Daniels et al., 2014 ). In vivo data corroborated these findings, since IFNAR (ifnar−/−) or IRF7 (irf7−/−) knockout mice infected with WNV presented higher BBB permeability and tight junction dysregulation compared to WT mice. Another mouse experimental model of WNV infection demonstrated that selective depletion of IFNAR in astrocytes resulted in increased BBB permeability, viral neuroinvasion, neuronal cell death, and immunopathology. Importantly, the loss of signaling via astrocyte IFNAR led to higher mortality rate of WNV-infected mice due to augmented virus entry, but not to virus replication into the brain ( Daniels et al., 2017 ). These findings corroborated the in vitro data showing that the activation of astrocytes was determinant for BBB disruption.", "Finally, the relevance of the BBB for WNV neurovirulence was accessed in mice deficient in several TAM receptors. In a study performed by Miner et  al. (2015 ), it was demonstrated that Axl/Mertk-deficient mice exhibited increased BBB permeability and higher viral load and mortality upon subcutaneous infection of WNV , in comparison to wild-type mice ( Miner et  al., 2015 ). In contrast, no difference in viral expression in the brain was detected when the virus was inoculated directly in the CNS by intracranial injection. These findings suggest that TAM receptors exert their protective role by preserving BBB integrity and restricting virus invasion of the CNS rather than affecting neuronal replication. Interestingly, it was also showed that Mertk-depleted BMECs were less responsive to IFN- β, indicating that cooperation between TAMR and IFNAR may be  a mechanism for endothelial barrier protection ( Miner et  al., 2015 ).", "ZIKA VIRUS Zika virus (ZIKV) was first described in Uganda, in 1947, and the first human cases were reported in 1963 ( Dick et  al., 1952 ; Simpson, 1964 ). Very few cases of human infection had been described in Africa and Asia until 2007, when an outbreak occurred at Y ap Islands. Another outbreak at French Polynesia was reported in 2013, and from 2015 to 2016, a huge epidemic started in Brazil and spread throughout Americas ( Duffy et al., Since then, ZIKV infection was associated with microcephaly and other neurological manifestations in fetuses and newborns upon vertical transmission, and this is now collectively called Zika congenital syndrome ( Melo et  al., 2016 ; Oliveira Melo et  al., 2016 ). Although less frequent, neurological disorders have also been reported in adults, including encephalitis and Guillain-Barre syndrome ( Brasil et  al., 2016 ; Carteaux et  al., 2016 ). ZIKV was detected in the post-mortem brains of microcephalic fetuses or stillborns and in the CSF of encephalitic adult ( Carteaux et  al., 2016 ; Mlakar et  al., 2016 ), indicating that the virus invades the CNS. Indeed, numerous studies indicated that ZIKV is neurotropic. Viral particles and RNA were detected in the brain of mice inoculated by different pathways ( Cugola et al., 2016 ; Li et al., 2016 ); in brain organoids infected in vitro (Garcez et  al., 2016 ); and in the CSF of infected rhesus monkeys ( Dudley et  al., 2016 ). However, the mechanisms associated to brain invasion are still unclear.", "Previous evidence indicated that endothelial cells from the BBB are permissive to replication of different ZIKV strains and that the virus may cross the endothelial barrier, without inducing a significant increase in its permeability ( Shao et al., 2016 ; Al-Obaidi et  al., 2017 ; Bramley et  al., 2017 ; Mladinich et al., 2017 ; Papa et al., 2017 ; Alimonti et al., 2018 ). Mladinich et al. (2017 ) showed that ZIKV (Porto Rico strain PRV ABC59) infected and replicated efficiently in primary human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMECs). ZIKV was basolaterally released in a transwell system, without inducing a remarkable cytopathic effect ( Mladinich et  al., 2017 ). Similarly, Papa et  al.  (2017 ) demonstrated that infection of HBMECs with African and Brazilian ZIKV strains (ZIKV MR766 and ZIKV PE243) resulted in efficient virus replication and basolateral release of infectious particles, which were able to replicate in other cell types seeded separately in a transwell system. It is important Mustafá et al. Blood-Brain Barrier Overcome by FlavivirusesFrontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org 8 March 2019 | Volume 10 | Article 525to notice that infection with ZIKV PE243 strain did not induce a remarkable CPE and no cell death was detected in the cultures, whereas infection with ZIKV MR766 was associated to some level of cytopathic effect. The viruses crossed the endothelial barrier with no apparent increase in permeability, which was further confirmed by the maintenance of tight junction protein expression and localization ( Papa et al., 2017 ). The study suggested that ZIKV might cross the endothelial barrier by endocytosis and exocytosis-dependent replication pathway or by transcytosis. Infection with both strains also induced HBMEC activation and secretion of IL6 and CCL5, what may contribute to the recruitment of leukocytes in an in vivo fashion ( Papa et  al., 2017 ). Other studies that used brain endothelial cells (i-BMECs) derived from pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) also confirmed that ZIKV (Canadian isolate) infected and traversed the iBMECs, without compromising the BBB ( Alimonti et  al., 2018 ). On the other hand, a 3D cell culture system using an HBMEC cell line showed a certain resistance to infection in comparison to conventional 2D culture. However, pretreatment of the cultures with inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF- α, increased virus replication and disorganization of the junctional network, indicating that an inflammatory response triggered in vivo might contribute to BBB disruption and ZIKV invasion of the brain. This study also established a transwell culture, in which HBMECs were seeded in the inserts and astrocytes in the abluminal chamber.", "Using this system, it was demonstrated that HBMECs allowed the migration of infected monocytes, which then enhanced the infection of the astrocytes ( Bramley et  al., 2017 ).", "In vivo experimental models supported the hypothesis that ZIKV may cross the BBB without severe disruption. In the study from Papa and colleagues using IFNAR-deficient mouse model, the presence of virus RNA was noticed very early after systemic infection, when no BBB disruption had been detected (Papa et  al., 2017 ). Immunostaining revealed the presence of ZIKV envelope protein in blood vessels and in the cells of plexus choroid of subventricular zone, suggesting that brain endothelial cells were indeed infected by the virus. Interestingly, barrier breakdown was detected at later time points upon infection. Given that leukocytes recruitment to the brains seems to be  determinant for neuronal lesion and lethality induced by ZIKV ( Jurado et  al., 2018 ), one can speculate that later BBB disruption was possibly triggered by the inflammatory response that followed virus replication. Another study comparing different ZIKV strains revealed that, depending on the mouse age, infection with ZIKV MR766 , but not with ZIKV PE243, resulted in mouse death ( Lucas et al., 2018 ). Evidence of BBB breakdown, including endogenous IgG leakage in the brains and microhemorrhagic lesions, were only detected after infection with ZIKV MR766 . However, it is still not clear whether BBB breakdown was essential for the neurological disease and death or if it was a marker and a consequence of a severe disease.", "It should be  considered that the African strain ZIKV MR766 was extensively passaged in mouse brains when it was isolated, what could explain its increased replication in the mouse model.", "Indeed, there are extensive differences between the sequences of ZIKV MR766 and the Asian isolates, like ZIKV PE243, which were not mouse adapted. Therefore, comparison between different ZIKV isolates might clarify the molecular mechanisms associated to disease or protection, including the contribution of the sequence differences for virulence, tissue tropism, pathology, and immune evasion. Regarding this, the protective response detected after infection with ZIKV PE243 strain was associated to specific CD4+ T cells and neutralizing antibody ( Lucas et al., 2018 ), suggesting that a systemic response may affect the amount of virus reaching the BBB and the lesion extension, ultimately affecting the disease outcome.", "Jurado and colleagues investigated the role of IFNAR deficiency in hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic cells in a mouse model of ZIKV infection. It was demonstrated that IFN response in non-hematopoietic cells was essential for protection against viral dissemination to the brain, BBB disruption, and ZIKV-induced neuropathology. Virus-induced paralysis was dependent of CD8+ T cells infiltration in the brains, indicating that leukocyte infiltration due to BBB disruption might be  a major issue for neuropathogenesis. They also observed that astrocytes were the main cell types infected in the brains of susceptible mice ( Jurado et  al., 2018 ). These findings indicated that astrocyte infection after virus crossing through BMECs might be an important contributor of subsequent BBB disruption and lymphocyte infiltration.", "ZIKV infection during the embryonic period also impacted vascular function, particularly the BBB ( Shao et  al., 2016 ).", "Inoculation of C57BL/6J or 129S1/SvImJ mice at the embryonic day 14.5 affected mouse neurovascular development, resulting in postnatal microcephaly and brain damage. Analysis of the brains at postnatal period indicated a significant increase in vessel density and diameter in the cerebral cortex, with evidence of leaky blood-brain barrier (BBB). Furthermore, the brains exhibited extensive microglial activation, astrogliosis, and high levels of IL-1 β and TNF- α (Shao et al., 2016 ). Thus, an excessive immune response can also harm the neurovascular development, leading to increased BBB permeability and brain damage.", "DENGUE VIRUS AND YELLOW FEVER VIRUS Dengue virus (DENV) and Y ellow fever virus (YFV) viruses are usually associated to systemic and hemorrhagic clinical syndromes, and neurological manifestations are considered sporadic. Although very rare, immunization with YFV may induce encephalitis, and even though it is usually controlled by the host, it represents a clinical concern ( Jennings et  al., 1994 ; Monath and Barrett, 2003 ; Beck and Barrett, 2015 ; Halstead and Cohen, 2015 ; Screaton et  al., 2015 ; Li et  al., 2017 ).", "YFV neurovirulence has been mostly investigated using laboratory neuroadapted strains and performing intracerebral inoculation in mice; therefore, the exact mechanism through which the virus accesses the brain and whether the viruses are capable to disrupt the blood-brain barrier remains unclear.", "Adult mice are resistant to systemic inoculation of YFV , and brain damage was only detected when high virus doses were inoculated. For this reason, neurological studies were mostly Mustafá et al. Blood-Brain Barrier Overcome by FlavivirusesFrontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org 9 March 2019 | Volume 10 | Article 525performed using intracerebral inoculation ( Barrett and Gould, 1986 ; Liu and Chambers, 2001 ). Based on these models, it was suggested that YFV accesses the brain tough hematogenous route ( Mims, 1957 ; Luethy et  al., 2016 ). More recent studies have been using mice deficient in IFNAR and/or IFNLR, which are highly susceptible to infection ( Luethy et al., 2016 ; Douam et  al., 2017 ). Douam et  al. (2017 ) demonstrated that IFNAR- deficient mouse presented increased viremia and high viral load in systemic organs, including liver, spleen, and kidney.", "The viral load in the brain was also higher than the one observed in WT mice, but it did not increase overtime.", "IFNAR−/− mice also lost weight and displayed clinical manifestations; but both parameters were recovered at later time points after inoculation. In contrast, mice deficient in both IFNAR and IFNLR (ifnar−/− ifnlr−/−) succumb to infection.", "These mice showed enhanced systemic infection and progressive increase of viral load in the brains, associated with evidence of BBB leakage. In both mice models, BBB permeability was only accessed at 5 dpi, whereas virus was already detected at", "3 dpi; therefore, it is difficult to determine whether BBB", "disruption was necessary for virus invasion. Importantly, significant differences in the profile of T cells activation, especially serum IFN- γ levels appeared to influence the disease outcome ( Douam et  al., 2017 ).", "Regarding DENV infection, increasing number of reports has been demonstrating the potential risk of neurological manifestations, with an incidence rating varying from 0.5 to 20% ( Li et  al., 2017 ; Vieira et  al., 2018 ). Encephalitis was reported in children and adults, and virus RNA and anti-DENV IgM were detected in the CSF ( Lum et  al., 1996 ; Domingues et  al., 2008 ; Vieira et  al., 2018 ). Analysis of clinical samples obtained from dengue fatal cases also demonstrated the presence of virus RNA or proteins in the CSF and in brain sections, suggesting that DENV may indeed achieve the CNS ( Miagostovich et  al., 1997 ; Ramos et  al., 1998 ; Araújo et  al., 2011 ).", "Similar to what was observed with other neurotropic viruses, DENV (serotype 2) was able to infect human BMECs, leading to the release of high titers of infectious particles and cell death in vitro (da Conceição et  al., 2013 ). hBMEC infection was associated to cellular activation with increased expression of ICAM and enhanced secretion of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, what may contribute to the recruitment of leukocytes in vivo (da Conceição et al., 2013 ). In another study, Velandia-Romero et  al. (2016 ) evaluated the infection and permeability of primary mouse brain endothelial cells (MBECs), cultured either isolated or with primary astrocytes. The cells were infected with a DENV-4 isolate or with its variant, the neuroadapted strain D4MB-6. It was observed that both DENV strains infected MBECs, but not the astrocytes. MBECs infection altered the structure and function of BBB, affecting the endothelium permeability and the localization of the tight junction proteins ZO-1 and Claudin-1. TJ disorganization then allowed paracellular passing of free virus particles in a transwell system ( Velandia-Romero et  al., 2016 ). Microglia was also demonstrated to be susceptible to infection to all DENV serotypes. In vitro infection of murine microglia cell line (BV2) with DENV 1–4 resulted in increased expression of proinflammatory cytokines, including TNF- α, IFN- γ, IL-1 β and IL-10, MCP-1, and IL-6, and of MMP-2 and MMP-9 ( Bhatt et  al., 2015 ).", "Although it had not been addressed, activation of microglia might contribute to BBB lesion. According to these data, infection of endothelial cells by DENV seems to be  more relevant for BBB disruption, when compared to infection by other flaviviruses. Still, virus interaction with other cell types associated to BBB could also affect the barrier integrity.", "A major caveat for the study of dengue pathogenesis in vivo is the limited susceptibility of small animal models to most DENV isolates. To overcome this issue, seminal papers were developed with mouse-adapted DENV2 strains (D2S10 and D2S20) derived from the parental PL046 isolate ( Shresta et  al., 2006 ; Orozco et  al., 2012 ; Prestwood et  al., 2012 ). Immunodeficient mice inoculated with D2S10 strain by systemic routes (i.v. or s.c.) presented virus in neuronal and non-neuronal tissues, showed high levels of inflammatory cytokines, and increased vascular permeability, resembling the main features of severe dengue. Importantly, mouse infection with this strain was lethal with no apparent signs of paralysis ( Shresta et  al., 2006 ; Orozco et  al., 2012 ; Prestwood et  al., 2012 ). On the other hand, the mice inoculated with PL046 presented virus only in the brain and spinal cord and exhibited paralysis ( Shresta et  al., 2006 ). However, the molecular mechanisms of virus dissemination to the CNS were not addressed in these models.", "DENV infection in immunocompetent mice was mostly performed by intracranial inoculation. Those studies were important to evaluate the virus neurotropism but did not access the role of BBB integrity for DENV-induced CNS manifestations.", "Chaturvedi et  al. (1991 ) were some of the first to report that DENV can destabilize the blood-brain barrier in vivo , using an experimental model of mice infected with a DENV2 virus strain . A remarkable increase in BBB permeability and high virus titers in the brains were evidenced when the mice were intracerebrally inoculated. In contrast, systemic (i.p.) infection induced slight alteration in the BBB permeability at late time points after infection, but no virus particles were detected (Chaturvedi et  al., 1991 ). Another study based on intracranial inoculation of different virus isolates indicated that DENV serotype and genotype features may also influence the neurological disease outcome ( Souza et  al., 2013 ). However, BBB integrity was not evaluated in this model.", "A major increment in the study of DENV neuropathogenesis came from the findings that mice deficient in IFN- α/βR and IFN- γR are highly susceptible and develop high viremia, paralysis, and death ( Sarathy et  al., 2015 ). Comparison between A129 (IFN- α/βR −/−) and AG129 (IFN α/β/γR −/−) mice intravenously inoculated with DENV2 demonstrated that IFN- γ signaling was essential to protect the CNS from viral invasion, through a CD8+T cell-mediated response ( Prestwood et al., 2012 ). Mice deficient in IFN-α/βR / IFN-γR / FcγRIIB were also susceptible to systemic infection, and virus was detected in the brains at late time points after infection ( Dhole et  al., 2016 ). Although DENV has been extensively detected in the brains and spinal cord upon systemic infection of AG129 mice, the pathway through which flaviviruses reach the CNS was not addressed (Shresta et  al., 2004 ; Prestwood et  al., 2012 ).", "Mustafá et al. Blood-Brain Barrier Overcome by FlavivirusesFrontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org 10 March 2019 | Volume 10 | Article 525Velandia-Romero et  al. (2012) developed another model of DENV infection in vivo , using suckling BALB/c mice (2–21 postnatal days) infected with the neuroadapted strain of DENV-4 (D4MB-6). Intraperitoneal inoculation of mice at 14 or 21 days after birth did not result in any clinical signs or mortality. In contrast, mice inoculated at 2 and 7 postnatal days developed fatal encephalitis accompanied by paralysis and postural instability. BBB leakage and increased viral replication in the brains were detected and correlated with the clinical outcome ( Velandia- Romero et al., 2012 ). However, BBB integrity was only evaluated at 6  days post infection, whereas virus replication was already detected in the brains at 3 dpi. Therefore, it is hard to determine whether the barrier disruption was essential or not for virus invasion of the CNS. Importantly, DENV antigen was detected in endothelial cells and in the microglia of the mice that developed neurological manifestations. Activated phenotype of the infected cells, astrocytosis, and leukocyte infiltration, close to hemorrhagic focuses, were also evidenced ( Velandia-Romero et al., 2012 ). These findings suggested that virus-BBB interaction might be  relevant to DENV neuropathogenesis.", "DENV dissemination was also accessed in a primate model of DENV infection with antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) ( Vasconcelos et al., 2016 ). Callithrix penicillate primates were subcutaneously infected with DENV3, followed by treatment with anti-DENV2 antibodies to mimic ADE. After several inoculations, virus antigen and microglia activation were detected in the brains, along with evidence of inflammation. Although the infection by DENV in the absence of ADE had not been explored, these findings supported the hypothesis that DENV is able to reach the CNS. However, infection of brain endothelial cells or BBB integrity was not investigated in this model.", "All the referred data indicate that DENV may potentially infect brain endothelial cells, activate those and other cells associated to the BBB, and cause neurological manifestations.", "However, except for the few studies with human fatal cases, most findings were achieved with limited experimental models.", "The use of small animal models is an alternative to bypass the technical complications of human studies. However, it has been largely demonstrated that different flaviviruses evade interferon response in human but not in mouse cells ( Ashour et  al., 2010 ; Grant et  al., 2016 ). Therefore, the dissemination of these viruses to the CNS after systemic infection has been mostly observed in immunodeficient mice. Although the relative resistance of adult wild-type mice to neurological disease caused by flaviviruses is a major caveat, some researchers claim that IFNAR-deficient mice might be  a relevant model, since the IFN response in human cells is normally counteracted by these viruses. Still, there are several gaps in the comprehension of the pathway through which DENV reaches the brain that worth to be  investigated.", "TICK-BORNE ENCEPHALITIS VIRUS Tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) is part of another complex of flaviviruses, which are not transmitted by mosquitoes, and it is present in Europe and Asia, with an estimation of 10,000 to 15,000 cases per year ( Kellman et al., 2018 ). Most infections are asymptomatic or are associated to a mild flu-like syndrome. However, in some individuals, the initial symptoms are followed by a second phase, characterized by neurological manifestations ranging from mild meningitis to severe encephalomyelitis. Up to 40% of these cases result in long-term neurological sequelae following encephalitis ( Holzmann, 2003 ).", "Like the other flaviviruses described here, the pathogenesis of tick-borne encephalitis in humans is not completely determined, but in vitro and in vivo infection models have been unveiling some aspect of the infection. Once the TBEV reaches the CNS, neurons are believed to be the primary target of virus replication. In vitro assays demonstrated that the virus is cytopathic and productively replicate and disseminate in primary human neurons and in human neural cell lines ( Růzek et  al., 2009 ; Bílý et  al., 2015 ). Astrocytes were also reported to be susceptible to TBEV replication, but resistant to virus-induced cytopathic effect. Rat primary astrocytes were productively and persistently infected by TBEV , but no cytotoxicity was observed until 14 dpi ( Potokar et  al., 2014 ). Similarly, Palus et  al. (2014 ) demonstrated that infection of primary human astrocytes (HBCAs) by TBEV resulted in sustained intracellular viral load and release of infectious particles, with no CPE or cell death until 15 dpi.", "Despite the lower frequency of infected cells in the culture, astrocyte activation was clearly evidenced by increased expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), higher mRNA expression of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, and enhanced production of MMP-9 ( Palus et  al., 2014 ). These findings suggested that astrocytes infection with TBEV could affect BBB integrity by the release of proinflammatory cytokines and MMP .", "However, like other neurotropic viruses, TBEV induced the expression of type I  IFN in astrocytes, which restricts the infection efficiency. Abrogation of IFN response by using astrocytes from IFNAR-deficient mice or by adding neutralizing antibodies to the cultures rendered mouse astrocytes more susceptible to TBEV infection, with increased virus replication and dissemination, and diminished cell viability ( Lindqvist et al., 2016 ). In addition, infection of cells in the presence of supernatants obtained from infected astrocytes induced ISG expression and limited TBEV infection, supporting the hypothesis that IFN released by astrocytes upon TBEV infection might limit viral dissemination ( Lindqvist et  al., 2016 ).", "Still, the pathways by which TBEV reaches astrocytes and neurons were not determined. It was only recently demonstrated that TBEV replicate in human BMECs ( Palus et  al., 2017 ).", "In vitro assays comparing lower and higher neuroinvasive lab strains of TBEV demonstrated that both strains productively replicated in HBMECs but did not induce remarkable CPE at the time points analyzed ( Palus et  al., 2017 ). Importantly, TBEV infection did not affect the expression or localization of tight junction proteins nor the expression of adhesion molecules. Also, the viruses were able to transmigrate through the endothelial barrier in vitro , without enhancing its permeability In vivo experimental mouse models demonstrated that subcutaneous infection with TBEV promoted neurological signs and death ( Růžek et  al., 2011 ). Kinetic analysis of virus dissemination and BBB integrity indicated that infectious particles Mustafá et al. Blood-Brain Barrier Overcome by FlavivirusesFrontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org 11 March 2019 | Volume 10 | Article 525were detected in the brain only after 7 dpi, simultaneously with the decrease of viremia. BBB disruption was not observed during the viremic phase of the infection, and it was only detected after 10 dpi. At this time point (10 dpi), the clinical symptoms were most evident, and the mice started to die. Taken together, these data indicated that infection of endothelial cells by TBEV does not affect the integrity of BBB. Also, although virus-endothelial cell interaction might be  relevant for virus transmigration and invasion of the CNS, these events seem to not require a significant disruption of the BBB. The impact on the BBB structure is possibly rather a consequence of the brain infection, but it is still determinant for disease severity ( Růžek et  al., 2011 ).", "CONCLUDING REMARKS Several flaviviruses are potentially neurotropic and neurovirulent, but the knowledge regarding the mechanisms of neuropathogenesis is very incipient for most of them. Also, the pathway through which flaviviruses reach the CNS is still unclear. Given the systemic nature of the initial infections caused by JEV , WNV , ZIKV , DENV , YFV , and TBEV , it is believed that they reach the brain mainly through a hematogenous route. Indeed, hemorrhagic focuses or other evidence of BBB leakage are often observed upon infection, indicating that viruses might cross the endothelial brain barrier to reach the CNS and cause neurological syndromes. In vitro experimental models have demonstrated that different viruses productively infect brain endothelial cells and induce cell death, what could be  a major contributor to BBB damage and virus crossing. However, the role of BBB disruption for viral invasion is controversial, and increasing evidence suggest that flaviviruses can traverse the endothelial barrier by transcellular pathways. In either case, viruses could then access other cells associated to the BBB, such as pericytes, astrocytes, and microglia. Infection of these cells might induce cellular activation and release of proteases and other mediators that affect TJ organization and BBB integrity. Barrier breakdown could be, then, a secondary effect due to the inflammatory response into the brain. Still, BBB damage seems to be essential for neuropathology, by further increasing the local viral load, leukocyte infiltration, and inflammation. Different pathways proposed for flaviviruses entering the brain through the BBB are depicted in Figure 1 . The scheme suggests that flaviviruses may reach the CNS by cell-free virus transcytosis through the endothelial cells or by transmigration of infected leukocytes into the CNS. Both mechanisms would allow the release of infectious virus into the brain that could then infect BBB-associated cells and neurons. Either pathway will be  followed by an inflammatory response. Inflammation, virus replication in endothelial cell, and/or cells associated to the barrier would then trigger BBB leakage.", "It is important to consider that most of the studies regarding the role of endothelial cell infection and BBB disruption for neuroinvasion and disease were performed in vitro or in mouse experimental models. In vitro assays were fundamentally developed using human transformed cell lines or primary cells from rodents, which are not natural hosts of these infections.", "Furthermore, wild-type adult mice usually control systemic infection by flaviviruses and do not develop neurological manifestation. For this reason, in vivo assays aimed to explore neurological syndromes were formally performed by intracranial inoculation. Systemic inoculation and investigation of virus invasion to the CNS in experimental models have been restricted to immunodeficient or suckling mice. Those are susceptible to virus dissemination, invasion of the CNS, and neuronal damage.", "It is important to point that even in these models, the phenomena are usually evaluated at fixed time point after infection, which does not give a clear picture of the sequence of events preceding CNS damage. Also, a detailed analysis of the specific cells infected by the viruses was poorly performed in in vivo models.", "The investigation regarding flavivirus neuroinvasion upon natural human infection is also very incipient. It probably reflects the inefficient or delayed diagnosis of the patients, which restricts the number of available samples with confirmed infection by flaviviruses. Clear investigation of the cells infected in the blood-brain barrier and CNS parenchyma requires good quality pathological analysis or cell isolation, followed by phenotypic or molecular evaluation of infection and activation.", "The inherent difficulty for tissue obtention for these analyses, associated to the low number of available samples, has been restricting the research to molecular diagnosis and confirmation of virus invasion of the CNS. Hence, whether brain endothelial cells are targeted by flavivirus infection and whether this event, associated or not with BBB breakdown, is relevant for virus invasion and neuropathogenesis upon natural human infection are still opening questions in the field.", "Finally, the experimental models have been unveiling several specific issues regarding flavivirus neuroinvasion, significantly improving the knowledge about these neglected diseases. However, systematic experiments designed to evaluate whether brain endothelial cells are indeed infected in vivo and to investigate the kinetics and relevance of the BBB breakdown are still need to be  performed. Also, effort should be  taken to improve flavivirus diagnosis and to strengthen the interaction between physicians and researchers, aiming to better understand the events followed flavivirus infection that leads to neuroinvasion and neurologic diseases in humans. Full comprehension of these mechanisms would identify specific molecular targets and stimulate the development of new medications against flavivirus neurological syndromes, ultimately benefitting the patients.", "AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS YM, LM, SC, and LA wrote the review.

These efforts may assist with the development of antiviral drugs, vaccines and diagnostic tests, as well as to promote advancemen ts in public health policies. Here, we aim to develop standard protocols for propagation, titration, and purification of Asian and Brazilian ZIKV strains, by systematically testing different cell types, kinetics, multiplicity of infection and centrifugatio n protocols. ZIKV produces a productive infection in human, non-human primate, and rodents -derived cell lines, with different efficacies. The highest yield of ZIKV -AFR and ZIKV -BR infectious progeny was obtained at 7 days post infection in C6/36 cells (7 x 107 and 2 x 108 PFU/ml, respectively). However, high titers of ZIKV -AFR could be obtained at earlier time points in Vero cells (2.5 x 107 PFU/ml at 72hpi), whereas ZIKV -BR titers reached 108 PFU/ml at 4dpi in C6/36 cells. High yield of purified virus was obtained by purification through a discontinuous sucrose gradient. This optimized procedure will certainly contribute to future studies of virus structure and vaccine development. Beyond the achievement of efficient virus propagation, the normalization of these protocols will also allow different laboratories around the world to better compare and discuss data regarding different features of ZIKV biology and disease, contributing to more effic ient collaborations and progression in ZIKV research. Keywords: Zika virus; virus propagation; virus purification; standard protocols", "INTRODUCTION Zika disease, caused by Zika virus (ZIKV) infection, has recently emerged as a global health concern, being reported in more than 60 countries around the world (WHO, 2016). The urgent need of reliable diagnostic tests, virus control measures, and efficient surveillance programs has gathered researchers with different expertise in a huge effort to further unders tand ZIKV biology.", "Zika virus (ZIKV) is an arthropod -borne virus (arbovirus), from Flaviviridae family, genus Flavivirus , which is transmitted by mosquitoes from Aedes genus. The virus was first isolated in 1947, in Uganda, and, until 2007, very few human cases had been described, all were associated with mild clinical symptoms (Dick, et al., 1952). After human -associated outbreaks occurred in Micronesia and Pacific Islands, in 2007 and 2013, ZIKV spread throughout the Americas, causing a large outbreak, es pecially in Brazil ( Lanciotti, et al., 2008; Hayes, 2010; Cao-Lormeau, et al., 2014; Faria, et al., 2016) . As virus circulation scaled up, a broader spectrum of clinical manifestations has been reported. Severe neurological symptoms, such as microcephaly and other malformations have been reported after congenital infection ( Oliveira Melo, et al., 2016; Rasmussen, et al., 2016, Melo, et al., 2016 ). Also, meningoencephalitis and Guillain -Barré syndrome were associated with ZIKV infection in adults ( Carteaux, et al., 2016; Brasil, et al., 2016 ). Importantly, other forms of transmission were confirmed or are being investigated, including maternal -fetal, sexual, posttransfusion and posttransplant, and even direct contact (Martines, et al., 2016; Calvet, et al., 2016; Mlakar, et al, 2016; D'Ortenzio, et al., 2016; Davidson, et al., 2016; Tang, et al., 2016; Nicastri, et al., 2016; Musso, et al., 2014; Musso, et al., 2015; Barjas -Castro, et al., 2016; Nogueira, et al., 2017; Swaminathan, et ZIKV is en veloped and contains a single -stranded positive -sense genome. Two different ZIKV lineages have been epidemiologically characterized, African and Asian. The African ZIKV is an ancestral strain, whereas the Asian lineage is currently circulating and causing the epidemic outbreak in the Americas ( Weaver, et al., 2016; Calvet, et al., The necessity of a global effort to study different aspects of ZIKA biology, including specialist and non -specialist scientific community, demands the es tablishment of standard protocols. However, the yield of low -titer ZIKV stocks in cell culture may be a hurdle for expanding the range of experimental approaches. Additionally, the use of concentrated and purified ZIKV as a source of virus stock would mini mize cross - interference of cellular molecules secreted from cells during infection, or even from constitutive cell contamination, as was described with A. albopictu s C6/36 cells line (Chen, et al., 2004). Therefore, purified virus stocks may be more suited for some experimental strategies than the use of infected -cell supernatants, particularly, those studies involving vaccine development, animal models and host -cell interaction assays. The establishment and standardization of routine protocols to propagate , titrate, and purify ZIKV particles, as well as the investigation of susceptible and permissive cell lines, will be, then, very helpful to overcome the current experimental problems and to optimize ZIKV research. Here, we determined the kinetics and optim al multiplicity of infection to propagate virus stocks and evaluated ZIKV infection in nine different cell lines. These cell lines represent epithelial, endothelial and glial cells, from lung, kidney and brain tissues, derived from insect (C6/36), humans ( HBMEC, A549, U87, and HeLa), non human primates (Vero, LLCM -K2), and rodents (BHK -21, C6). Moreover, we established a protocol for virus particles purification leading to optimal yields and purity. The standardization of reliable protocols may expedite the study of ZIKV biology and contribute to efficient Zika -study networks.", "MATERIALS AND METHODS Cell lines C6/36 mosquito cell line (ATCC -CLR1660; kindly given by Dr. Andrea T. Da Poian, Instituto de Bioquímica Médica, UFRJ) were cultured at 28°C in Leibovitz (L -15) medium (Life Technologies) supplemented with 0.3% of tryptose phosphate broth, 0.75% sodium bicarbonate, 0.2% of L -glutamine (Sigma -Aldrich, St Louis, MO), 10% FBS (Life Technologies) and nonessential amino acids . Vero (ATCC -CCL81; ki ndly given by Dr. Amilcar Tanuri, Instituto de Biologia, UFRJ), LLC -MK2 (ATCC -CCL7), and A549 (ATCC -CCL -185) cells were cultured in DMEM high glucose, supplemented with L - glutamine and 5% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY). U87 -MG (ATCC-HTB14; kindly given by Dr. Amilcar Tanuri) and C6 glioma (ATCC -CCL107) cells were cultured with the same culture medium supplemented with 1 mM non -essential amino acids. HBMEC (human brain microvascular endothelial cells; kindly provided by Dr. Dennis Grab, The Johns Hopkins University, MD, USA) (Nikolskaia, et al., 2006) were cultured in M199 supplemented with L -glutamine and 5% fetal bovine serum. All cells, except for C6/36, were maintained at 37°C with 5% CO 2. Mycoplasma -free conditions of cell cult ivation were routinely certified by checking the presence of cytoplasmic DNA in a fluorescence microscope, using DAPI probe (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and by PCR, using a mixture of oligonucleotides for the specific detection of mycoplasmas, as previously described (Freshney, 2005). Virus ZIKV strain MR766 (ZIKV -AFR, ATCC VR1838) was kindly provided by Dr. Amilcar Tanuri (Instituto de Biologia, UFRJ).", "ZIKV -BR PE was isolated from a febrile case in the state of Pernambuco, Brazil and was kindly provided by Dr. Ernesto T.A. Marques Jr. (Centro de Pesquisas Aggeu Magalhães, FIOCRUZ, PE) (gene bank ref. number KX197192). ZIKV -BR SP was distributed as part of ZIKA FAPE SP NETWORK and it was kindly provided by Dr. Mauricio L. Nogueira (FAMERP, SP) (Faria, et al., 2016). Both ZIKV -BR samples were obtained after 3 -4 passages in C6/36 cells and metagenomics analysis was performed by our group after six passages in C6/36 cell line, as described therafter. Metagenomics and genome assembly ZIKV samples (2 x 105 PFU) in 300 l was filtered through 0.22 µm membranes, followed by RNA extraction (QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit, Qiagen). To remove any residual DNA, the samples were treate d with RNase -free DNAse, according to manufacturer’s instructions (DNAse RNAse -free Set, Qiagen®) Double -stranded cDNA libraries were constructed by Truseq Stranded total RNA LT (Illumina®) with Ribo -zero treatment, according to the manufacturer´s instruc tion. The library size distribution was assessed using 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent®) with High Sensitive DNA kit (Agilent®), and the quantification was performed with 7500 Real -time PCR System (Applied Biosystems®) with KAPA Library Quantification Kit (Kapa Biosystems). Paired -end sequencing (2 x 300 bp) was done with MiSeq Reagent kit v3 (Illumina®). The sequences were analyzed using the PRINSEQ software to remove reads smaller than 50 bp and those with Phred quality score of < 20. Paired -End reAd merger (PE AR) software was used to merge and extend the paired -end Illumina reads using the default parameters ( Schmieder and Edwards , 2011a; Zhang , et al., 2014) . The extended reads were analyzed with Deconseq program, against the Human Genome Database, with Identity and Coverage cutoff of 70%, to remove human RNA sequences ( Schmieder and Edwards , 2011b) . Non - human reads were analyzed against all GenBank viral genomes (65,052 sequences) with BLAST software using 1e -5 e-value cutoff. The sequences rendering a g enome were assembled with SPAdes 3.7.1 software (Nurk, et al., 2013) followed by a reassemble with CAP3 program ( Huang and Madan, 1999). The metagenomic results are demonstrated as Supplementary Data.", "Cell infection Cells were cultured overnight in their r espective culture medium and supplements for complete adhesion, until 70% confluence was obtained. Then, each cell type was infected with the different ZIKV samples, using MOIs from 0.01 to 0.25, in the absence of FCS, for 90 min, with gentle agitation, fo r virus adsorption. Media were removed, and substituted by the appropriate culture medium, supplemented with 2% FCS (C6/36, Vero, HBMEC, LLC -MK2 cells) or 7% FCS (A549, C6, HeLa cells). Infected cell cultures were observed daily for possible cytopathic eff ects (CPE). Cells and supernatants were harvested when about 70% CPE was observed, or at the indicated time points. To perform temporal analyses of ZIKV replication in VERO and C6/36 cells, culture supernatants were collected on the indicated days and repl aced with proportional fresh medium. Plaque assay Samples obtained at different time points post -infection were titrated by plaque assay. Vero cells were plated, in 24 -well plates, at the concentration of 4 x 104 cells/500l/well, and cultured overnight for complete adhesion. Then, medium was removed, cells were washed with PBS, and incubated with serial dilutions of virus samples, in FCS -free medium. After 90 -min incubation under slight agitation, medium was removed, cells were washed with PBS, and cultu red with different concentration of carboxy -methil -cellulose (CMC), supplemented with 1% FCS. After 5 days, cells were fixed overnight with 4% formaldehyde and stained with 1% violet crystal for 1 h. Plaques were counted and virus yield was calculated and expressed as PFU/ml. Analysis of viral replication by qRT -PCR C6/36 cells were infected with the indicated MOI of ZIKV -BR PE for 7 days, as described. The supernatant was harvested and RNA was extracted using TRIZOL reagent (Life Technologies), according to the manufacturer’s instructions, using 300 l of supernatant and 1 ml Trizol. Treatment with DNAse I (Ambion, Thermo Fisch er) was performed to remove genomic DNA contamination and first strand cDNA was synthesized using High -Capacity cDNA Archive Kit (Applied Biosystems), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. cDNAs were tested with quantitative real -time PCR using a S tepOnePlus Real -time PCR system and Taqman Master Mix Reagents (Applied Biosystems), using primers and probe specific for the E sequence, as described by Lanciotti et al ( Lanciotti, et al., 2008) . The supernatants was titrated by plaque assay to perform a standard curve and determine the equivalent PFU.", "Virus purification C6/36 cells (108) were infected with ZIKV -BR PE (MOI=0.01) for 7 days and the supernatant was harvested and clarified to remove cellular debris by centrifugation at 700 g for 20 min at 4oC. The supernatant was then centrifuged at 150,000 g for 2.5 h at 4oC, using a 45Ti rotor (Beckman). The supernatant was discarded and 200 µl of 3E buffer (0.12 M tris -base, 0.06 M sodium acetate, 3 mM EDTA), pH 7.4, was added to the pellet, which was incu bated overnight at 4ºC to resuspend virus pellet without agitation and minimize loss of viral particle integrity. The resuspended pellet was than ultracentrifuged in a discontinuous 10 -60% sucrose gradient at 116,000 g for 1.5 h at 4oC, using a SW41 rotor (Beckman). The gradient fractions were identified as upper (up), middle, two purified fractions (FP#1 and FP#2), and the lower fraction (bottom), and collected in an approximate volume ratio of 1:4:1:1:5 (ml). Sucrose was removed from purified fractions by centrifugation in centrifugal filter units (Amicon Ultra -15 3000 NMWL, Merck Millipore) with PBS at 7,500 g at 4° C for 30 min, adding PBS at 10 min intervals. The virus was stored at -80°C. Each fraction obtained from the gradient was titrated by plaque assay, as previously described. In addition, fractions were also analyzed by electrophoresis in SDS -polyacrylamide gel stained with Coomassie Blue -R. Electron Microscopy Electron microscopy analyzes were performed using the negative contrast technique. ZI KV purified samples were fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde (Sigma -Aldrich) in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 7.3, for 30 min. Then, 10 µl of the samples were dropped gently on copper grids, previously coated with Formvar film (Ted Pella), where they remai ned for 2 min for adherence of the ZIKV on the film. The drop was gently dried with filter paper, followed by negative staining with 5% uranyl acetate for 30 sec and, then, gently dried with filter paper. The images were obtained in transmission electron microscope FEI Tecnai Spirit operating at 120 kV.", "Statistical analyses Data were analyzed using the GraphPad Prism software (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA). Comparisons among groups were performed by two way ANOVA; p values <0.05 were considered statistically significant.", "RESULTS Replication kinetics of ZIKV -AFR and ZIKV -BR PE in Vero and C6/36 cell lines Standardization of the stock titers and replication kinetics of ZIKV, in mammalian and mosquito cell lines are necessary to study the virus bio logy. Initially, we evaluated the best conditions to determine virus titers by plaque assay, using Vero cells. Cells at 70 - 80% confluence were infected with different dilutions of the virus stock, and incubated with different concentrations of CMC for 5 da ys. After fixing with formaldehyde and staining with violet crystal, we detected clear and homogeneous plaques when cells were cultured with 1.5% CMC. Infected Vero cells cultured with 1% CMC generated irregular, comet -like plaques; and monolayers incubate d with 3% CMC generated very small plaques, which were difficult to count with consistency (Figure 1). We also performed the titration assay at different days post -infection and with higher cell confluence, but the results were not clear nor reproducible ( data not shown).", "Once we established that 5 days of infection and 1.5% CMC were the best conditions for plaque assay, we started to determine the best protocol to propagate ZIKV in mammalian (Vero) and mosquito (C6/36) cell lines. We also compared two diff erent virus isolates, the prototype ZIKV MR766 strain, from African lineage (ZIKV -AFR), and the Brazilian ZIKV isolate from Pernambuco, which was previously sequenced and belongs to Asian lineage (ZIKV -BR PE) (Way, et al., 1976; Donald, et al., 2016). Vero cells were infected with different MOIs, from 0.1 to 0.01 and supernatants were harvested at 3 days post -infection (dpi), when 70% CPE was detected in the culture. The efficiency of virus replication increased as the MOI was reduced. ZIKV -AFR showed highe r replication rates in this cell type when compared with ZIKV -BR PE, with titers above 107 PFU/ml at MOI 0.01 (Figure 2A). To confirm that ZIKV infection has reached the highest titer at 3 dpi, cells were infected with both ZIKV strains, at MOI 0.01, and supernatants were harvested after 2, 3 and 4 dpi (Figure 2B). Cell morphology and CPE were also evaluated daily, as shown in Figure 2C. Titers of ZIKV -AFR were almost 107 PFU/ml at 2 dpi already, reaching a peak on day 3, and a small decrease later on, when most of the cells were dead (Figures 2B and 2C). On the other hand, ZIKV -BR PE showed a slower replication kinetic when compared with ZIKV -AFR, reaching the highest titer (3 x 106 PFU/ml) only at 4 dpi. Although CPE was detected at this time point, the cell s were still adhered to the flask, whereas in the ZIKV -AFR -infected cultures, most of the cells had already detached (Figure 2C).", "Similar assays were performed using freshly thawed C6/36 cells,., in which both ZIKV -AFR and ZIKV -BR PE produced high levels of infectious virus particles, when cells were infected at MOI 0.01 (Figure 3A). The differences detected due to infection with different MOIs were much less prominent, in comparison to what was observed during infection of Vero cells with both ZIKV strains. In addition, cytopathic effect was barely detected until 7 dpi, and at 10 dpi, around 70 -80% of the monolayer was intact (Figure 3C). We harvested supernatants from cells infected with either ZIKV -AFR or ZIKV -BR PE at 4 to 10 dpi, and analyzed virus titers by plaque assay. Infection with ZIKV -BR PE resulted in higher virus titers at 4 dpi, despite no obvious CPE formation (Figure 3B and 3C). After this time point, 50% medium was replaced by fresh culture medium, and supernatants were harvested at 7 and 10 dp i. Virus titers were very similar at subsequent time points, indicating that high -yield ZIKV -BR PE stocks can be obtained as early as 4 dpi in C6/36 cells. Infection with ZIKV -AFR also resulted in high virus titer, but only at 7 dpi (Figure 3B).", "These data indicated that both cell lines are useful for virus propagation, yielding approximately 107-108 PFU/ml, when a MOI of 0.01 was used. Interestingly, higher titers of ZIKV -AFR were obtained at earlier time point in Vero cells (107 PFU/ml at 3 dpi), , whereas ZIKV -BR PE replication showed a faster and higher replication rate in C6/36 cells (108 PFU/ml in 4 days). Therefore, the time point for harvesting the cell supernatant should be different according to the virus strain and cell line. To investigate whether these differences were specifically related to the virus isolate, we compared two diff erent Brazilian ZIKV isolates – ZIKV -BR PE (previously used) and ZIKV -BR SP. Both isolates showed similar replication kinetics and yield of infectious progeny in C6/36 and Vero cells (Figures 4A -D).", "We then established a correlation between the production of infectious ZIKV particles and the detection of virus genome using, respectively, the plaque assay protocol described here and qRT -PCR described by Lanciotti ( Lanciotti, et al., 2008) . Supernatants from ZIKV -BR PE-infected cells were used to perform a virus titration curve, ranging from 103 to 108 PFU, and tested by quantitative real time RT -PCR; the correlation between PFU and Ct numbers is shown in Figure 4E.", "Susceptibility of different cell lines to ZIKV replication After confirming C6/36 and Vero cells as standard cell models for virus propagation, we analyzed the susceptibility of distinct cell types, obtained from different tissues and host species, to the Brazilian ZIKV strain. Cell lines from human origin (A549, HBMEC, U87, HeLa), primates (LLC -MK2), rat (C6) and hamster (BHK -21) were evaluated. In order to compare the replication efficiency between the cell lines, we normalized the infection protocol using MOI 0.1 and harvested the supernatants at 3 dpi. In cases where we could not observe any evide nce of CPE at this time point, cells were maintained for longer periods. Since those cells may be cultured at different concentrations to achieve confluence and may show distinct proliferation and survival kinetics under their specific culture conditions, we calculated the PFU/cell ratio, considering the initial cell numbers at the time of infection. Among the mammalian cell lines tested in this work, human lung epithelial (A549) and human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMEC) showed the highest rat es of extracellular progeny production, above 1 PFU/cell. However, none of them reached the progeny production of the invertebrate cell line C6/36 (16 PFU/cell), which further increased to 468 PFU/cell at 7 dpi. All other cell lines tested, including brai n-tumor derived cells, were poorly permissive to virus replication showing very low progeny yields in comparison to A549, HBMEC, C6/36, and Vero cells (Table 1).", "Standardization of ZIKV purification method Finally, we set up a protocol to purify ZIKV, all owing the production of virus stocks highly concentrated and free of most cell contaminants. For this purpose C6/36 cells, which gave the highest virus yield, were infected with ZIKV -BR PE at MOI 0.01. After 7 days, virus was purified from the cell supernat ant using a discontinuous 10 -60% sucrose gradient, as described in Methods. Purified ZIKV could be clearly detected as an opaque band in the centrifugation tube, which was then defined as the purified fraction (PF) (Figure 5A). For further analyses, differ ent gradient fractions were defined (Figure 5A) and carefully collected for analysis by SDS -polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. A protein band with the expected mass of the viral E glycoprotein was enriched in the purified fraction (Figure 5B). To determin e the presence of infectious ZIKV particles along the gradient fractions, all fractions were titrated by plaque assay. Indeed, despite the presence of ZIKV in all fractions, the purified fraction showed titers higher than 109 PFU/ml (Figure 5C) and the efficiency of infectious virus recovery was determined to be higher than 65% (Table 2). Analysis of the purified fraction by electron microscopy confirmed the enrichment of intact purified virus of approximate 50 nm size (Figure 5D), as previously described (Kostyuchenko, et al., 2016) .", "DISCUSSION Autochthonous transmissions of ZIKV have been reported in Brazil since 2015 followed by rapid virus spread to other American countries (Faria, et al., 2016; Zanluca, et al., 2015; Campos, et al., 2015) . The acuteness of the outbreaks and the severe neurological effects of the infection compelled the scientific community to invest efforts in the study of various aspects of ZIKV biology. Many research groups involved in ZIKV research came from different backgrounds, mos tly outside the flavivirus field, needing to overcome the obstacles imposed by the generation of low -titer virus stocks, a well -known feature of the flaviviruses (Maramorosch and McIntosh , 1994) .", "In the present work, we determined routine protocols to propagate, titrate and purify ZIKV, using mosquito and mammalian cell lines. C6/36 and Vero cells have been used for virus propagation, but different laboratories would use diverse protocols, resulting in different yields of virus stocks. Research groups t hat have not worked with ZIKV or other flaviviruses would need to obtain standard protocols. Our goal was to determine the appropriate cell lines and infection conditions to obtain optimal virus titers in a reproducible fashion. For that purpose, we tested cell confluence, MOI and replication kinetics of ZIKV from African and Asian lineages. ZIKV -AFR used in this study was the African isolate prototype MR766, which was originally propagated in Vero cells ( Way , et al., 1976) . In fact, this strain was best pr opagated in this cell type, with the production of more than 107 PFU/ml at 2 dpi.. On the other hand, the two Brazilian strains (Asian lineage) analyzed in this study replicated best in mosquito C6/36 cells. However, if one needs to compare different virus strains, it will be desirable to use viruses that originated or propagated from the same cell source. Therefore, we established that a 4 - day infection of Vero cells, and 7 day -infection of C6/36 cells, using MOI of 0.01, provide similar titers for both ZI KV strains. It is important to note that infection with ZIKV did not induce a remarkable CPE in C6/36 cells, and high virus yields were obtained even when cell morphology and adherence to the flasks were similar to mock -infected controls. In addition, we d etected that C6/36 infection produced highest yields when the cells were used freshly after thawing.", "Virus -induced CPE also differed when Vero cells were infected with ZIKV -AFR or ZIKV -BR PE. In the latter case the cells adhered to the flasks for longer per iod, although presented a more round morphology. These subtle details may also help researchers to analyze whether the cell type is adequate for virus propagation.", "Importantly, we evaluated ZIKV replication in a few cell lines, from different tissues and h ost species, and detected two human cell types – HBMEC and A549 - which produced high virus titers upon infection. Interestingly, virus replication in brain -tumor derived cells from rat or human origin produced negligible titers. ZIKV -AFR replicated better in primate cells than the Brazilian strain, probably reflecting prior virus adaptation to non -human primate cells. In this context, it is noteworthy that infection of mosquito C6/36 cells with ZIKV -BR generated the highest progeny production among all tes ted cell lines.", "Finally, ZIKV purification was achieved by sedimentation through a sucrose gradient with a recovery efficiency higher than 65%. The recovery of purified ZIKV was confirmed by SDS -acrylamide gel electrophoresis, electron microscopy, and titr ation of all fractions. High yields and purity of purified virus are essential for studies on virus structure and virus interaction with cellular components. A previous study had described a method for ZIKV (French Polynesia strain H/PF/2013) purification using a sucrose cushion centrifugation followed by a continuous potassium tartrate gradient (Sirohi , et al., 2016) . This method also allowed high yield of purified ZIKV, but required the use of a Vero cell lineage that overexpressed protease furin, differe nt from the cell line used in the present work, C6/36, which is routinely used by several groups. In addition, we were able to obtain enriched virus fractions using less C6/36 cells than Vero because the mosquito cells produce the highest yield of extrace llular infectious virus among all tested cell lines.", "In summary, we developed detailed protocols that may help researchers from different areas of expertise to study ZIKV biology and pathogenesis. Our study might contribute to further establish ZIKV netwo rks around the world to control this infection.

The disease hasacomplex epidemiologi- calpattern and ahigh economic impact globally and isconsidered hyperendemic, i.e.dengue fever hasahigh incidence and/or prevalence rate affecting allgroups equally [3,4]. Worldwide, itisestimated that 390million new DENV infections occur annually [1],and thisnumber will likely increase with thecreation ofnew vector habitats duetoclimate change [5].Because of their wide distribution, particularly inurban and peri-urban environments intropical and subtropical regions, mosquitoes oftheAedes genus arethemain vectors ofthisdisease [6,7].", "DENV canlead toawide spectrum ofclinical manifestations that areclassified bytheWorld Health Organization (WHO) asdengwetihoawhtrvningsigns,dengwetihotrvningsigns and seyevedengwe [8].Previous infections with aheterologous type areusually, butnotexclusively, associated with progression tomore severe disease [1].", "There arefour genetically distinct serotypes ofDENV (DENV-1 to-4)that share similar epidemiological features [6].Each serotype isdivided into distinct groups defined asgeno- types, which inturn subdivided indifferent lineages [9,10]. The circulation ofthevirus ischar- acterized byfrequent lineage turnover, inwhich alineage ofcirculating viruses isusually replaced byanew lineage, awell-documented phenomenon known asclade replacement (CR). CRcanlead toanincrease inthenumber ofcases and intheseverity ofthedisease [10± 17]. Inprevious CRevents, anestablished lineage circulating foranumber ofyears inagiven population isreplaced when anew lineage isintroduced. This replacement isusually followed bytheextinction oftheprevious lineage after aperiod ofco-circulation ofboth lineages [10± Since themid-1980s, DENV-1 hasbeen circulating inBrazil. AllBrazilian DENV-1 isolates described todate belong togenotype V,which issubdivided into three distinct clades (lineages 1,3and 6)[18±20].

Therefore, differences inreplicative fitness didnotexplain theobserved pattern ofL6persistence.", "Evasion ofinterferon responses bythevirus could beafactor underlying themaintenance oftheL6lineage inthepopulation. This hasbeen identified asadeterminant ofepidemiologi- calfitness inthelineage dominance ofDENV-2 (PR-2B) inPuerto Rico [15]. During flavivirus infections, short flavivirus RNAs (sfRNAs) areproduced bytheincomplete degradation of viral RNA bythehost-cell exonuclease Xrn1. These sfRNAs areassociated with thepathogene- sisofflaviviruses [25]. The high expression ofsfRNAs could have inhibited type Iinterferon responses and facilitated evasion oftheimmune response. Inastudy conducted inPuerto Rico, thePR-2B lineage produced elevated expression ofsubgenomic flavivirus RNA (sfRNA) relative togenomic RNA (gRNA) during replication. Notably, sfRNA could bind TRIM25 and inhibit theIFN response. Thus, higher sfRNA:gRNA ratios areassociated with superior epide- miological fitness [15]. Although L6hadhigher sfRNA:gRNA ratios than L1,which inturn could increase itsepidemic potential, itdidnotappear toberelated toIFN inhibition, asprevi- ously reported [15].

Distinct Tcellphenotype andfunction, with increased Tcells activation andIFN-γ production might then beassociated todisease con- trol[27±30].

However, studies using non-human primates have indicated that new inoculations with either thesame ordifferent genotypes ofDENV-2 cancause apersistent boost inneutralizing antibodies [31]. Because L6 only weakly stimulates Band Tcells, itmay notincrease immunological memory, normay it induce thedevelopment ofneutralizing antibodies insufficient titers toprotect against anew exposure. Although further work with specific experiments areneeded tostrengthen thisevi- dence, itappears that neutralizing antibodies may quickly control infections, preventing more severe disease; however, they may notavoid future infections. Asimilar mechanism hasbeen proposed forstudies inNicaragua [31] and may provide anexplanation forthemaintenance ofL6forsuch along period inthepopulation. High viral loads ofL6enhance theprobability ofvector transmission oftheL6lineage. However, despite thebetter replicative fitness, theL1 lineage appears toelicit astronger immune response, preventing broader propagation ofthis lineage duetotheextinction ofthesusceptible population.", "Based onourdata, theabsence ofCRtogether with thesuperior epidemiological fitness of L6inSJRP wasaresult ofthehuman immune system functioning asabottleneck that favored theL6lineage toachieve abroader distribution, even with lower viral fitness.

This association is supported by the presence of ZIKV in the fetal brain and amniotic fluid, and findings suggest that infection of the placental barrier is a critical step for fetal ZIKV infection in utero . Therefore, relevant models to investigate the interaction between ZIKV and placental tissues are essential for understanding the pathogenesis of Zika syndrome. In this report, we demonstrate that explant tissue from full-term human placentas sustains a productive ZIKV infection, though the results depend on the strain. Viral infection was found to be associated with pro-inflammatory cytokine expression and apoptosis of the infected tissue, and these findings confirm that placental explants are targets of ZIKV replication. We propose that human placental explants are useful as a model for studying ZIKV infection ex vivo . Introduction Zika virus (ZIKV), a member of the family Flaviviridae , is an enveloped, single-strand RNA virus that was the causative agent of major outbreaks in the Americas in 2015 [57, 69]. Its genome has a typical flavivirus architecture and is approximately 11 kb in length. The virus was first isolated from a Rhesus Macaque in 1947 in the Zika for - est in Uganda; however, ZIKV infection had been poorly investigated until recently, when numerous infections were reported in more than 60 countries and territories around the world. Major outbreaks have been recorded on the Yap Islands (2007), in French Polynesia (2013), and in Brazil (2015). The virus is primarily transmitted by Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, and humans are considered to be amplification hosts, though nonhuman primates may be involved in main - tenance of the virus in Africa [ 68]. In addition, the virus is unique in relation to other flaviviruses such as dengue virus (DENV) in that it may be transmitted by alternative routes, including through sexual and maternal-fetal routes [ 20, 21, Most of the cases associated with ZIKV infection are either asymptomatic or present only mild symptoms such as fever, rash, joint pain, and conjunctivitis. Myalgia and headaches have also been reported.

R. Ribeiro et al.", "however, ZIKV infection was highly correlated with neu- rological manifestations, particularly in developing fetuses after congenital infection [4 , 9, 44]. In fact, infection of pregnant women has been associated with miscarriage, fetal abnormalities, microcephaly, and other neurological diseases in newborns [41, 53]. The virus has been isolated from multiple bodily fluids from infected individuals, including serum, urine, saliva, and semen [48]. Importantly, the virus has also been detected in amniotic fluid and in the brains of microcephalic newborns and fetuses in cases of stillbirth [7 , 46], demonstrating that ZIKV crosses the placenta through an unknown mechanism of action.", "Recent studies using experimental mouse models have also indicated that the virus might cross the placental bar - rier, leading to congenital ZIKV transmission. Systemic infection of pregnant mice resulted in abnormal brain devel - opment and microcephaly in the offspring, outcomes that were attributed to viral neurotropism [14, 45, 72]. Infec- tion of trophoblasts and endothelial cells in the placentas of ZIKV-infected mice and nonhuman primates have also been reported [1 , 45, 54]. However, most animal models used to study ZIKV infec- tion are deficient in the expression of type I or type I and type II interferon receptors (A129 and AG129, respectively) [2, 45, 59]. Mice that lack components of innate immune responses, including Mavs have also shown susceptibility to ZIKV infection [37]. Although these models are useful for evaluating the efficacy of vaccine candidates and therapies, they may not represent the true effects associated with trans-placental transmission of the virus in immunocompetent individuals, or the condi-tions in the placenta that favor viral multiplication, including possible local inflammation. A critical unmet need is a model that can be used to quickly, quantitatively, and effectively screen for function-ally relevant countermeasures that may protect the fetus from intrauterine transmission of ZIKV. In this report, we demon-strate that placental explants obtained from full-term placen - tal tissue both support and are affected by ZIKV infection. This tissue may be useful as a model for such experimenta-tion, as well as for the development of treatments against ZIKV infections. Materials and methods Cell lines and viruses Vero cells were cultivated in MEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units of penicillin per mL, and 100 μg of streptomycin per mL at 37 °C in a humidi-fied atmosphere containing 5% CO", "2.

The DENV-2 strain used was New Guinea C, or NGC (GenBank accession number AF038403). The viruses were propagated and titrated using Vero cells. The viral stock was aliquoted in 100-µL portions and stored at − 80 °C. Titers were determined and titrated using a standard TCID 50 assay.", "Infections in human placental explant cultures Normal human placenta tissues were obtained from full-term elective cesarean deliveries in cases of non-labor after 38 to 40 weeks of gestation (n = 10) at the Children’s and Maternity Hospital of São José do Rio Preto, São Paulo, Bra-zil, after approval from the local research ethics committee. Placentas were processed within 15 min of delivery. Cho-rionic villi were dissected into 5-mm sections, and tissues were washed extensively with PBS (1x). Explants were cul-tured in standard tissue culture plates in DMEM (Cultilab) combined with Ham’s F-12 Nutrient Mixture (HAMF-12; Thermo Fisher) and supplemented with 10% FBS (GIBCO), 1% penicillin-streptomycin, and 100 mg of gentamicin per mL. Cultures were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO", "2. Twenty-four hours after", "plating, samples were infected with 1 × 104 TCD50 of ZIKV- BR or DENV2. The culture was incubated for 4 hours to allow for virus adsorption. The explants were then washed three times with PBS (1X) for complete removal of the inoculum. The explants were then maintained in DMEM/HAMF-12 with 2% FBS. Culture supernatants from infected and uninfected explants were collected at 0, 3, 6, 12, 24, 72, and 120 hours postinfection (hpi) without the addition of fresh media or washing. Explants were then collected to determine total RNA and were fixed in 4% paraformal-dehyde for histology and immunohistochemistry analysis. The culture medium was collected to perform plaque assays and to quantify β-hCG through the use of electrochemilu-minescence (Roche Hitachi, Cobas ® e411). Some sample tissues that had been cultured for 24 hours were also treated with neutralizing anti-TNF RII/TNFRSF1B antibody (100 ng/mL, R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA) or TLR-3 ligand polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid, or poly (I:C) (50 μg/mL; Sigma-Aldrich) for 24 hours. Viral quantification ZIKV RNA was quantified from culture supernatants using a TaqMan-based qRT-PCR assay (GoTaq ® Probe 1-Step RT- qPCR System, REF AG120) as described previously [35]. DENV2 RNA was analyzed using a SuperScript III Platinum SYBR Green One Step RT-qPCR Kit (REF 1136-059) and Zika virus infection of human placental explants 1 3the primers described by Chutinimitkul and colleagues [11].", "The primer and probe sequences are described in supple-mentary Table A1.", "Plaque assay Vero cells were plated at a density of 5 × 105 cells per well in a six-well plate and cultured for 24 hours at 37°C under 5% CO", "2. Serial dilutions of supernatant from explant cul -", "tures (24 and 72 hpi) were added to each well for 1 hour of incubation. After the medium was removed, infected mon-olayers were covered with 1.5% carboxymethylcellulose (CMC)/MEM with 2% FSB at a 1:1 ratio. Plaque foci were detected on day 5 after fixation with 10% formalin solution and staining with 2% crystal violet. Histological analysis Infected placental tissue sections and their uninfected controls were fixed in 4% buffered formalin for 24 hours, dehydrated in graded ethanol, and embedded in paraffin for histopathological analysis. The samples were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and analyzed using a high-power objective (20×) on an Axioskop 2-Mot Plus Zeiss microscope (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany). To quantify nuclear fragmentation, 10 random photos were taken of experiments performed in triplicate, and the amount of karyorrhexis was determined for each photo. The mean plus or minus standard deviation per field is shown. Immunohistochemistry ZIKV infection and caspase-3 activation were analyzed in the placental explants using immunohistochemistry. Sec-tions of infected placental tissue and the uninfected controls were collected at 72 and 120 hpi. Some samples were also treated with neutralizing anti-TNFRII/TNFRSF1B antibody (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) and harvested at 72 hpi. Serial 3-μm-thick tissue sections were deparaffinized and rehydrated prior to antigen retrieval in citrate buffer at a pH of 6.0. Endogenous peroxide activity was blocked with 3% hydrogen peroxide for 30 minutes, followed by block - ing with 10% bovine serum albumin (BSA; Sigma-Aldrich, Missouri, USA) in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) for 2 hours. The slides were incubated with primary mouse antibody against flavivirus E protein (4G2) at a dilution of 1:100, anti-caspase-3 (Abcam, cat. number ab2302) at 1:200, anti-cytokeratin 7 (Dako) at 1:250, or anti-vimentin (Dako) at 1:150 in 10% TBS-BSA for 1  hour at 37 °C, all of which were applied in independent trials. After the washing step, sections were incubated with a secondary antibody (HRP-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit antibody; Abcan). Positive staining was detected using 3,3′ -diaminobenzidine (DAB substrate; Invitrogen, USA). Finally, sections were counterstained with H&E (hematoxylin from InlabConfiança and eosin from AnalytiCals). A negative reaction control was run in the absence of primary antibodies. Analysis was performed using an Axioskop 2-Mot Plus microscope (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany) and AxioVision software for densito-metric and quantitative analysis. The experiments were each performed in triplicate using samples from three individual donors, and ten fields were quantified in each section. Den-sitometric analysis was used to determine caspase-3 and 4G2 intensity in sections of placental tissue (40×) on an arbitrary scale from 0 to 255, and the data were expressed as the mean plus or minus standard deviation [6 ]. Cytokine gene relative expression analysis RNA from virus-infected explants and uninfected con-trols was extracted using TRIzol according to the manu-facturer’s instructions (Life Technologies). Likewise, RNA was extracted within 24 hours from uninfected samples treated with 50 μg of poly (I:C) per mL, as well as from the untreated controls. Cytokine gene relative expression analy - ses were performed using a SuperScript III Platinum SYBR Green One Step qRT-PCR Kit (Invitrogen; REF 1136-059). The primer sequences for the IL-6, IL-10, IL-1β, TNF-α, IFN-β, IFN-γ, IFN-λ1, and IFN-λ4 cytokines are listed in supplementary Table A2. A comparative ΔΔCt method was used to quantify gene expression levels based on GAPDH Ct values for normalization. TUNEL assay Detection of nuclear DNA fragmentation as a morphological marker of the apoptosis process in histological sections was performed using a TUNEL assay. The assay was performed using an In Situ Cell Death Detection Kit (TMR red). After 3 days of infection, 3-mm infected tissue sections and unin-fected controls were deparaffinized, hydrated, and rinsed with 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), followed by blocking with 3% BSA and 20% FBS. TUNEL reaction mixture (TdT enzyme fluorescein-labeled nucleotide mix) was added, and the sections were incubated for 60 minutes at 37 °C. For the positive reaction control, the sections were treated with 3U of DNase I per mL for 10 minutes at room temperature. Quantitative analysis was performed using Image-Pro ® Plus image analysis software, and fluorescent images of TUNEL-positive cells were captured using an Olympus BX53 micro-scope system at 40× in red channel detection in the range of 570 to 620 nm. Tests were performed in duplicate, and images of three random fields were acquired from each slide to calculate the mean plus or minus standard deviation. M. R.

Results and discussion Placental explants support ZIKV infection Our goal was to determine whether explants of human pla-cental tissue are a useful model for studying ZIKV infection ex vivo . To that end, normal full-term placental tissues were obtained following cesarean section. Chorionic villi were dissected, and the explants (5 mm) were infected with ZIKV-BR or dengue virus 2 (DENV2) for comparison. Immu-nostaining of the tissues at 72 hpi with the anti-flavivirus antibody 4G2 demonstrated that the tissues were infected by both viruses (Fig.  1a-d). To confirm that placental explants would support a progressive ZIKV infection, culture super - natants from these infected explants were obtained at 0, 3, 6, 12, 24, 72, and 120 hpi, and virus RNA levels were ana-lyzed using RT-qPCR (Fig.  1e). We observed a progressive increase in the ZIKV RNA load as early as 12 hpi, with a peak at 72 hpi. DENV 2 RNA was also detected in placental supernatants until 24 hpi, but RNA levels did not increase at the subsequent time points. Culture supernatants from infected tissues collected at 0 hpi exhibited a viral load of < 10 1, and this value was subtracted from those obtained at subsequent time points. Uninfected tissues exhibited no viral load when measured using RT-qPCR. The release of infectious virus particles at different time points after infection was also evaluated using plaque assay. Accordingly, we observed increased levels of ZIKV plaque-forming units (PFU) in the supernatants of explanted tissues, whereas DENV2 PFU levels decreased at later time points (Fig.  1f). H&E staining and histological analysis demonstrated that placental tissues infected with ZIKV-BR showed signs of cellular injury, in contrast to uninfected tissues (Fig.  2a- c; additional images can be found in Figure A3 of the Supplementary Information). The presence of trophoblasts in these sections was confirmed by the high expression of the cytokeratin-7 epithelial cell marker (Fig.  2d-f), as well as by the absence of vimentin expression (mesenchy - mal cell marker) (Fig.  2g-i). In addition, the quantifica- tion of nuclear fragmentation revealed a larger amount of karyorrhexis in ZIKV-BR infection than in uninfected and DENV-infected tissues, a finding that suggests that viral replication may indeed be associated with tissue damage (Fig.  2j). Other studies have demonstrated that placental explant cultures secrete hCG during the process of explant re-epithelization [31, 34, 47, 67]. We evaluated whether ZIKV infection would affect the secretion of b-hCG, a marker of syncytiotrophoblast (SCT) renewal and viabil-ity (Fig.  2d-i, k) [ 32]. ZIKV-infected tissues exhibited lower b-hCG secretion in the culture than the uninfected control (Fig.  2k), a result that suggests lower SCT recov - ery upon ZIKV infection. Meanwhile, DENV-infected tissues exhibited lower b-hCG secretion after 48 h, thus reducing SCT viability. However, SCTs were found to increase secretion of b-hCG 72 h after infection, suggest-ing improved SCT recovery. These findings are in accord-ance with previous studies on experimental mouse models, the results of which have demonstrated the infection of fetal and maternal placental tissues [45]. These and other experimental models have also shown that ZIKV infects various primary human placental cell types and chorionic villus explants, and the data are suggestive of infection occurring via placental and paraplacental virus transmis-sion routes [56, 63]. Previous studies have reported that both cytotrophoblasts (CTBs) and SCTs from chorionic villi exhibit E protein expression upon ZIKV infection; however, only CTBs expressed the nonstructural protein NS3 [63]. In addition, it has been proposed that tropho-blasts are resistant to ZIKV replication, based on a study showing that different trophoblast-derived cell lines were permissive to ZIKV, while human primary trophoblasts exhibited low viral RNA levels when compared to other cell types [3 ]. On the other hand, both macrophages and CTBs obtained from the same tissues were found to be susceptible to ZIKV [56].", "An experimental model involving pregnant rhesus mon- keys revealed prolonged viremia compared to non-pregnant animals, and the use of this system has provided important data on ZIKV infection in the first and third trimesters. These data show that placentas from late-stage pregnancies are still vulnerable to ZIKV. Therefore, models of infection in full-term explants can be used to recapitulate the second half of pregnancy. Furthermore, full-term explants have the advantage of being easy to obtain after delivery [13, 54]. Our data clearly demonstrate that full-term human pla- centa explants are permissive to ZIKV and DENV2 infec-tions, which are associated with cell injury. Discrepancies between different studies may be attributed to the time at which the explant was obtained and to the specific ZIKV strain used. It is important to note that immunohistochemical staining and progressive RNA release from cultures indicate that this model can be used to study the dynamics of infec-tion and of host-virus interaction. Zika virus infection of human placental explants", "1 3ZIKV infection induces cytokine expression", "in placental explants Placental damage and dysfunction caused by viral infection may be a consequence of the viral cytopathic effect or host-mediated pathology [28]. Such conditions alter placental development, restrict fetal growth [42], and may result in neuroinflammation [66]. To determine whether antiviral or inflammatory responses to infection are related to placental dysfunction, we evaluated the expression of interferons (IFNs) and pro-inflammatory cytokines in ZIKV-infected placenta explants. ZIKV infections in other experimental models have been associated with increased expression of innate immune sensors and interferon-stimulated genes [27]. Also, studies have found purified primary human trophoblasts and troph-oblast-derived cell lines to be resistant to ZIKV infection due to the production of type III IFNs (IFN-λ1 and -λ2) Fig. 1 ZIKV productively infects human placental tissue explants.", "Placental explants were left uninfected (control) (a) or infected with ZIKV (b) or DENV (c) at 1 ×  104 TCID50.

Our experimental model supports ZIKV replication, so we investigated whether and how the relative expression of type I (IFN-β), type II (IFN-γ), and type III (IFN-λ1 and λ4) IFNs would take place in infected placental explants. As a positive control of IFN expression, we cultured explants with poly(I:C) and observed an increase in IFN-β, IFN-λ1, IFN-λ4 and IFN-γ expression at 24 hpi relative to untreated cultures (Fig.  3a). Notably, IFN-λ4 and IFN-γ reached higher levels of expression than IFN-β and IFN-λ1. Pla-cental explants were also infected with ZIKV or DENV or left uninfected, and IFN expression was evaluated at 24 and 72 hpi.

At 72 hpi, IFN-λ1 and IFN-λ4 expression", "in infected explants increased as much as tenfold in the cases of both viral infections. Type III IFNs include IFN-λ1, λ2/λ3, and λ4, all of which seem to induce a similar antiviral response pattern mediated by IFNLR1/IL-10R2 engage - ment and activation of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway, thus leading to ISG expression [29, 33, 43]. Several studies based on different infectious models have demonstrated that IFN-λ1 and IFN-λ2/λ3 are similarly regulated by IRF-3 and IRF-7 activation. These results strongly suggest that type I and III IFN genes are regulated by a common mechanism.[38]. Despite the differential activation of IFN-λ1 and IFN-λ2, detailed analyses are needed to elucidate the mechanism of this activation. Influenza A virus induces the expression of IFN-λ1 (but not IFN-λ2), although Sendai virus has been found to induce production of high levels of IFN-λ1 and IFN-λ2 [50]. In the infection of both trophoblast cell lines and pri- mary human trophoblasts with ZIKV, the secretion of IFN-λ1 and IFN-λ2 was constitutive. This result demonstrates the important role of interferon-type-III-mediated protection from ZIKV infections at the maternal–fetal interface [3 , 12]. IFN-λ4 was discovered more recently, and there is evi- dence that its expression is regulated by a transduction signaling pathway similar to those regulating other type III IFNs [38, 52]. Our data demonstrated that type III IFNs were produced in the placental explant model and increased over the time points evaluated, and this is consistent with previ-ous data obtained from the use of other placental culture models [3 , 12]. The activation of the type III IFN-inducing pathway was further demonstrated by the increased levels of IFN-λ4 mRNA, the expression of which seems not to have been evaluated for ZIKV infection prior to this study. Any discrepancies between our results and those in the literature could be attributed to factors such as the use of different ZIKV strains and the use of a placental explant rather than a single epithelial cell type from the placenta. ZIKV and DENV2 also induced mild increases in IFNβ expression at 24 hpi, and there was a subsequent significant increase in IFNβ expression at 72 hpi only in the ZIKV-infected explants (Fig.  3c). Interestingly, our results on IFN-γ expression showed a similar pattern, in which only ZIKV infection caused an increase in IFN expression at 72 hpi (Fig.  3d). IFN-γ may induce apoptosis of human pri- mary trophoblasts, mediate proliferation and migration of extravillous cytotrophoblasts (EVCT), and, when in excess, be harmful to pregnancy and to fetal growth [36, 65, 70]. ZIKV NS5 has been found to destabilize STAT2 and sup-press the signaling mediated by type I and type III IFN [5 , 10, 56]. Therefore, increased levels of IFNs produced to restrict ZIKV infection may be counteracted by the virus while also inducing inflammation and other host responses that could have deleterious effects on pregnancy. To investigate other aspects of the immune response to ZIKV in placental explants, we assessed the relative expres-sion of IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-α in ZIKV-infected tis-sues (Fig.  4). Tissues were either stimulated with poly(I:C) or infected with ZIKV or DENV. All groups exhibited increased expression of all of the cytokines evaluated (IL-1β, Fig. 3 IFN relative expres- sion in infected placental tissue explants. Explants were cultured with poly(I:C) for 24 hours. RNA was extracted, and the IFN mRNA levels were analyzed by quantitative RT-PCR and normalized using the housekeeping gene GAPDH (a). Explants were cultured with ZIKV or DENV for 24 or 72 h. Next, RNA was extracted, and mRNA levels of IFN- λ1 and IFN- λ4 (b), IFN- β (c), and IFN-γ (d) were analyzed by quantitative RT-qPCR and nor - malized by GAPDH. Results are shown as fold change relative to controls consisting of unin-fected tissues and unstimulated poly(I:C). The data shown are representative of at least three independent experiments and are presented as the mean +/− standard deviation M. R. Ribeiro et al.", "IL-10, IL-6, and TNF-α) upon infection/stimulation relative to uninfected controls. At 1 day postinfection (dpi), ZIKV-infected explants exhibited significantly higher expression of IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α in comparison to DENV2-infected explants (Fig.  4a, b, and d). The expression of pro-inflam- matory cytokines such as IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α alters the intra-amniotic milieu and is a marker of fetal inflammatory response syndromes. Increased Th1 cytokines have been associated with spontaneous preterm labor and with dis-ruption of fetal tolerance [17, 22, 58]. IL-1β has also been associated with the expression of metalloproteinases and CTB invasion during pregnancy [40, 55]. In vitro treatment with IL-1RA impaired trophoblast fusion, viability, and hCG secretion, indicating that IL-1B plays an important role in placental dysfunction and adverse pregnancy outcomes [15, 24]. TNF-α expression during pregnancy is associated with detrimental effects, including gestational hypertension and gestational diabetes mellitus [ 26, 30, 62]. TNF-α may act directly upon early-term placentas and cause placental pathology, fetal hypoxia, and neurodevelopmental defects in the fetal brain [8 ]. Also, TNF-α disturbs trophoblast func- tion, leading to decreased cell fusion and reduced expression of hCG [39, 51]. TNFα may also be associated with cell death, as described in other models [23]. IL-10, on the other hand, is typically anti-inflammatory, which often results in tissue protection and is involved in fetal tolerance [19, 60, 61]. ZIKV infection induced the expression of significant levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, but not of IL-10. This combination could result in pathology and may account for some of the deleterious effects of ZIKV infection during pregnancy. DENV2 was not able to induce the expression of pro- inflammatory cytokines to the same levels as ZIKV, a differ - ence that may be associated with lower replication efficiency and consequent lower stimulation of the immune system. ZIKV‑infected placental explants undergo apoptosis To investigate whether ZIKV-induced replication, inflam-mation, and injury would result in cell death, we performed TUNEL assays 3 days after ZIKV infection to determine whether the explanted tissue underwent apoptosis (Fig.  5). DNase treatment was used as a positive control (Fig.  5a), while untreated, uninfected explants were used as negative control (Fig.  5b). ZIKV-BR-infected samples demonstrated prominent TUNEL staining, which appeared to be quantita-tively comparable to the positive control sample (Fig.  5c). DENV infection resulted in lower TUNEL staining (Fig.  5d), which corroborates previous H&E data indicating that DENV2 causes less placental damage in this model. Apoptosis was further confirmed by immunohisto- chemistry with cleaved caspase-3 antibodies. ZIKV-BR and DENV2 exhibited increased cleaved caspase 3 stain-ing relative to the uninfected control, which is indica - tive of apoptotic cell death (Fig.  6a-f). Cleaved caspase 3 expression was higher in ZIKV-infected cultures than in DENV-infected cultures (Fig.  6h). Immunostaining was performed, and the stain was found to cover the Fig. 4 Cytokine relative expres- sion profiles in placental tissue explants. ZIKV-BR- and DENV2-infected explants were analyzed for cytokine gene expression using RT-qPCR. Uninfected explants (UI) and poly(I:C)-stimulated tissues were analyzed as negative and positive controls, respectively. Unstimulated poly(I:C) and uninfected tissues were used to compare the fold increase. Total RNA was extracted from the explants on days 1 and 3 postinfection. The RNA levels for IL-1β (a), IL-6 (b), IL-10 (c), and TNF-α (d) were quanti-fied using gene-specific primers. The analysis was performed using samples obtained in triplicate. Data are represented as the mean +/− standard devia-tion. One-way ANOVA was performed, followed by Bonfer - roni correction. *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01; and ***, p < 0.001 were considered significant Zika virus infection of human placental explants", "1 3chorionic villi. This result suggests that SCTs may be sus-", "ceptible to apoptosis via active caspase-3 in ZIKV infec-tions. SCTs cover chorionic villi and play a key role in the innate immune response and recruitment of NK cells [25]. Accordingly, previous studies that have investigated ZIKV tropism in several placental cell types have found ZIKV replication to be associated with abnormal tissue architecture, which could lead to the rupture of the pla-cental barrier [16].Cleaved-caspase-mediated apoptosis may result from an enhanced inflammatory response, such as the response involved in the TNF-α-TNFR signaling pathway. Because we detected increased expression of TNF-α in placental explants infected with ZIKV, we decided to investigate whether the observed apoptosis could be mediated by this cytokine. ZIKV-infected explants were treated with anti-TNF RII/TNFRSF1B neutralizing antibody, and cleaved caspase-3 activation was evaluated using IHC. Indeed, Fig. 5 Evaluation of ZIKV- induced apoptosis in placental explants measured by TUNEL assay. Infected explants on day 3 postinfection and unin-fected explants were analyzed by TUNEL assay. Panel a represents the DNase-I-treated positive reaction control sample. Panel b represents the unin-fected sample (control). TUNEL staining of placenta villi sections of ZIKV-BR (c) and DENV2-infected (d) tissue are shown. The images of TUNEL-positive cells were obtained at a magnification of 40x using an Olympus BX53 microscope system. Quantification was performed by measuring image intensity using Image-Pro ® Plus software, version 7.0. One-way ANOVA and the Bonferroni correction were performed to determine statistical signifi-cance (*, p < 0.05; confidence interval, 95%) M. R. Ribeiro et al.", "the anti-TNFR treatment significantly reduced cleaved cas- pase-3 staining, indicating that TNF-α-mediated apoptosis plays a significant role in tissue damage (Fig.  6d-f). TNFR neutralization also reduced cleaved caspase-3 staining in DENV-infected cultures, suggesting that both viruses are able to induce apoptosis, although lesion extension was found to be more severe when the tissues were infected with ZIKV. Some cell death was still observed after anti-TNFR treatment, suggesting that other mechanisms may also be involved in ZIKV-induced tissue damage. Previous studies have demonstrated that ZIKV infection in human neural progenitors (hNPCs) promotes increased caspase-3 expression, even in the presence of low levels of viral anti-gens [23]. These findings suggest that this pathway may be induced by ZIKV in different cell types and may be a rele-vant mechanism associated with congenital abnormalities.We conclude that our placental tissue explant model is a valuable tool for the study of ZIKV interaction with the human placenta. We observed that placental explants are permissive to and support ZIKV and DENV2 infections for up to 120 hours. Because ZIKV is pathogenic to the human placenta, infected placental explants are amenable to different types of analysis and may therefore serve as a model in future research. Importantly, this model rein-forces some critical observations made regarding ZIKV infection in other model systems and in patients [45, 49]. Due to its use of human placentas, this model provides crucial information to be applied to the clinical manage-ment of ZIKV infection, as well as to the development of preventive or therapeutic strategies against the deleterious effects of ZIKV on human embryos.

In response to those challenges, individuals, businesses, non -profit organizations, the academia, and governments develop new ideas for improving the lives of the communities around them (Westley & Antadze, 2010). With around 10% of the world’s population living in extreme poverty, around 800 million people undernourished and 25% of urban residents living in slum -like conditions (Sachs et al., 2019) there is a high demand for solutions to social problems across the world, and consequently an increasing interest in research on the topic of social innovation (Agostini et al. , 2017).", "The European commission’s project ‘Social Innovation: Driving Fo rce of Social Change’ (SI -DRIVE), which investigated 1005 cases of social innovation worldwide, described social innovation as an initiative for change in social practices that contributes to limiting social problems or satisfying needs of specific societa l actors (Howaldt et al, 2016). Social initiatives typically start small and localized , and can remain small, even when they are successful (Uvin, Jain & Brown, 2000) , because actors may choose to focus on serving specific local communities.", "Scaling social impact is considered one of the most challenging and critical topics within the area of social innovation and social enterprises (Uvin & Miller, 1996; Dees et al., 2004; Cannatelli, 201 7; Islam, 2020a ). For the past years, academia has discussed the urgency of maximizing the impact of successful innovations by spreading them to more contexts and expanding them geographically (Dees et al. 2004; Bloom & Smith, 2010; Bradach, 2010). The t opic of scaling soci al impact is relevant from both practitioner and governmental and regulatory perspectives as a solution -oriented strategy promoting higher efficiency in the social sector (Bradach 2010). Attracting multiple interest into the subject of how social innovatio n can be scaled.", "Research on scaling social impact has addressed multiple research questions (Cannatelli, 201 7; Islam, 2020a). Researchers have investigated the definition of scaling impact (e.g., Dees et al., 2004; Islam, 2020a), the processes (e.g., Desa & Koch, 2014) , the drivers (e.g., Bloom & Chatterji, 2009 ; Scheuerle, & Schmitz, 2016; Gauthier, Ruane, & Berry, 2019 ), the challenges (e.g., Bradach, 2003; Deiglmeier, & Greco, 2018) , the effect of contextual conditions (e.g., Smith & Stevens, 2010; Corner & Kearins, 2018) , the organizational models (e.g., Bacq & Eddleston, 2018) , the strategies (e.g., Uvin & Miller, 1996; Lyon & Fernandez, 2012; Westley et al. , 2014) , the actor’s characteristics (e.g., Bacq et al. , 2015; Rangan & Gregg, 2019) , the motivation (e.g., Tykkyläinen et al. , 2016; Lunenburg, Geuijen, & Meijer, 2020), and the level of control of the organization (e.g., Smith, Kistruck & Cannatelli, 2016) . Despite such advancement s on scaling social impact as a research topic this does not mean that it has become a well understood phenomenon or an easy process for practitioners to manage (Uvin, Jain & Brown, 2000). Therefore, the present work proposes an integrative framework based on t heoretical propositions that emerged from the existing literature and apply the identified variables to perform a cross - case analysis of two Brazilian NGOs.", "1.1 Context ualization of the research topic", "Brazil is the fifth largest country in the world in both po pulation and land area, with", "209 million people and 8.300.000 km² (World Bank, 2018). Brazil’s developments", "prospects attract interests not only due to its size and natural resources but also because it remains today one of the world’s most unequal countries , with the income of 5% of Brazilian richest people being the same as the income of the remaining 95 percent The distribution of economic opportunities and access to basic social services show the deep and persistent inequalities in the country (World Bank Group, 2016). According to IBGE, in 2019, 25% of Brazil’s population was below the poverty line, around 50 million people were living with less than US$5,50 a day, and 6% were below the extreme poverty line, representing over 11 million people living with less than US$1,90 a day . Brazil’s inequality goes beyond income distribution, since over 21% of the population lived in inadequate housing and only 63% of the population had access to water, sanitation, and waste management simu ltaneously in 2019 (IBGE, 2020).", "The Brazilian context also counts with poor public management of resources and corruption scandals, a lack of access to basic public services and rights, such as education, technology, and security (Cippola & Afonso, 2018) becoming a very interesting context for the development of social innovation in response to unmet social needs . The social innovation ecosystem in Brazil has been centered on NGOs and foundations since the period of democratization in 1985 , that fill in the gaps left by the government in areas like education, health, and poverty alleviation (Anastacio, Filho & Marins, 2018).", "According to IPEA ( Lopez, 2018) there are 781.921 NGOs active in Brazil , from which over around 208.000 are religious organizations and 22.000 are professional associations . The remaining organizations work mostly in development, advocacy and human rights, culture, education, social assistanc e and health and environment , as portrayed in Figure 1 . More than 40% of the org anizations are located in the southeast region of the country, over 80% do not have any employees and 7% have up to two employees.", "Figure 1 - Distribution of Brazilian NGOs according to area (2019)", "Source. Mapa das Organizações da Sociedade Civil , 2020 According to Cippola and Afonso (2018) social innovation in Brazil originates from both the urban middle class who have access to knowledge and resources and groups originated from low-income population and peripherical areas, that develop their social innovation initiatives without expert guidance or government support. The biggest strength of those groups comes from their own creative and entrepreneurial skills alongside their proactive atti tude, following an entrepreneurial bricolage logic fitted to a resource constraint environment (Janssen, Fayoelle and Wuilaume, 2018) like Brazil. The growing number of social innovations in Brazil have enormous potential to rebuild the social fabric, reduce inequality, and promote a sustainable consumption and production pattern (Cippola & Afonso, 2018). However, despite being such a potential context for social innovation research, the phenomenon of social innovation in Brazil is still understudied in both theoretical and practitioner’s literature ( Bataglin, 2017; Anastacio, Filho & Marins,", "1.2 Importance of the research", "The literature regarding scaling social impact is still very fragmented. Most works focus only on one aspect of the process and are u nable to provide a comprehensive overview of the phenomenon. The multidimensional nature of the topic of scaling social impact combined with the fragmented literature and diversity of terms, concepts, and definitions (Van Lunenburg, Geuijen & Meijer, 2020) prevent the development of generalizable knowledge and the formulation of articulated theories and hypothesis. The process of social innovation is dynamic, and the result of multiple adaptations and adjustments resulted from the exchange a nd participation of the multiple stakeholders involved in the process (Bataglin, 2017) .", "Thus, combining multiple factors of the literature together can yield useful insights into how different actors scale social innovation . Drawing on a systematic review of the existing literature on scaling social impact up to 2020, the aim of this dissertation is to complement the literature with an updated integrative framework of analysis of the phenomenon that can allow practitioners and researchers to better understa nd the phenomenon and identify the potential for scaling or define strategies for achieving higher impact that fit their objectives and competencies. It also allows the identification of areas of collaboration and development with potential partners, like governments, foundations, and the academia. Different than other existing frameworks, the proposal of this work is to follow a non-linear approach to scaling, treating all factors as both drivers and limitations of the process. When treating the phenomenon of scaling as a linear step by step process , the literature fails to take in consideration the multiple logics (Corner & Ho, 2010; Fisher, 2012; Weerakoon, Gales & McMurray, 2019 ; Van Lunenburg, Geuijer & Meijer, 2020 ) that can drive and guide the scaling process.", "Research focused on social innovation developed in Brazil is still scarce (Bataglin, 2017; Anastacio, Filho & Marins, 2018). By developing case studies of Brazilian organizations with relevant size and unique offerings that weren’t studied previo usly regarding their scaling endeavors complement s the existing literature review by adding relevant examples to the existing theoretical literature.", "1.3 Research framework", "The present work proceeds as follows. First, a systematic review of the existing literature was conducted to identify the key factors involved in the phenomenon and advance theoretical propositions based on the data obtained from the literature review. The six dimensions and ten propositions are presented throughout ch apter 2. In section 2.5, dimensions identified from the literature review were synthesized in a n integrative framework. In chapter 3, the methodological process of both theoretical and empirical sections of this work are described in detail.", "After the theo ry development, a multiple case stud y of two existing Brazilian NGOs that have successfully scaled their impact is presented following a replication approach. In the first section of chapter 4, the Brazilian social innovation ecosystem that is the common context of both case studies is presented. In the following sections of chapter 4, each case study is presented independently.", "In chapter 5, t he cases were analyzed using the theoretical propositions previously developed and compared to draw cross -case conclusions. The objective of this two -step approach is to develop theoretical propositions and fill in part of the knowledge gap in the social innovation literature, while also adding examples and complementing the literature on social innovation in Brazil . Finally, in chapter 6 conclusions , limitations and suggestions for future research were presented.", "2 LITERATURE REVIEW", "According to Van Lunenburg, Geuijen and Meijer (2020), a literature review of scaling social impact is complicated due to the variety of terms and concepts that are used to refer to the same or similar processes, in different areas. Throughout the review process described in detail in secti on 3.2.1, we analyzed 67 documents , among articles and books , including in the research document s that focused on scaling, growth, or expansion of social innovation or social enterprises. The selected documents encompass ed research around the definition, process, strategies, case studies, requirements for scaling, challenges, and limitations. After reading, the documents were coded through a descriptive process and organized into four central c ategories that emerged from the analysis of the existing literature : (1) scaling impact , (2) barriers, (3) resources and capabilities for scaling, and ( 4) strategic pathways . Each of those concepts involve existing factors and decisions to be made by the actors and organizations in the process of scaling their impact.", "2.1 Scaling i mpact", "Dees , Anderson and Wei -skillern (2004) describe scaling i mpact as not just serving more people and communities, but also about serving them well . Building on that description, Desa and Koch (2014) develop ed two categories of scaling impact: ‘breadth impact’ and ‘depth impact’. Breadth impact refers to the quantitative growth of impact , it describes any expansion, geographic or not, that increases the number of people benefiting from the solution. Depth impact , on the other hand, refers to a qualitative improvement in terms of the effectiveness of addressing the social issue . Westley et al (2014), identif ied two different types of scaling: scaling out and scaling up. Scaling out is related to breadth impact, as it englobes any process of expansion, replication or dissemination that increases the number of people or communities impacted. Scaling up, also relates to breadth impact as it increases the number of people impacted , however this refers to institutional changes, as it is achieved through changing policies, rules, and law s. Moore, Riddell and Vocisano (2015) included a third category to the classification called scaling deep, based on a more permanent impact achieved through changes in cultur al values, beliefs, and relationships. Scaling deep is a combination of both breadth and depth impact, as it addresses both quantitative and qualitative improvements.", "A more detailed taxonomy of scaling impact was developed by Uvin and Miller (1996) with four different categories of scaling impact: q uantitative, functional, political , and organizational. The first type, quantitative, can be compared to breadth impact and scaling out, it includes geographic expansion , increases in membership base, or support ed organizations. The second one, functional, describe s the expansion in number and type of programs and activities in the same community. In this category the impact increases not in terms of q uantity of people, but in depth. Political, the third category, is just like scaling up, it focuses on increasing the impact through changing laws and policies. The fourth and last category is organizational scaling , that is defined as developing internal capabilities that result in improvements in the effectiveness and efficiency of their activity.", "Later , Uvin, Jain and Brown (2000) present ed two paradigms of scaling, the old one, where scaling comes from expansion and the organizations become larger, more efficient and professionally managed and a new paradigm of multiplication and mainstreaming in a more indirect manner through spinning off o rganizations, sharing innovations, creating alternative knowledge, and influencing other social actors. The old paradigm is limited to an operational growth, while the new paradigm presents an ecosystem growth. T hese two paradigms are not exclusive, and actors can choose to move forward along different lines simultaneously .", "Uvin, Jain and Brown (2000) than adjust ed the previous taxonomy to include ecosystem growth. The patterns became expanding coverage and size, when the organization become larger, increasing activities, with the expansion and diversification of the activities undertaken by the organization, broade ning indirect impact, when the focus is in affecting the behavior of other actors and reaching the target beneficiaries through the activity of others, and enhancing organizational sustainability , where the focus is developing organizational capabilities a nd increasing the efficiency, reducing overall uncertainty and achieving a sustainable stable position.", "Throughout this work we will define scaling impact as any expansion in the number of people affected by a social innovation or any increase in the impa ct of a social innovation in the same group of people. Therefore we will treat the extent to which an actor can successfully scale a social innovation not only in terms of its size, but also in terms of the number of spin -offs created, and the number of pr ojects that have been developed or taken over by other actors (Uvin, Jain & Brown, 2000; Bradach, 2010), that way we will encompass an integrative definition of scaling impact, like the one developed Scaling social impact is an ongoing process of increasing the magnitude of both quantitative and qualitative positive changes in society by addressing pressing social problems at individual and/or systemic levels through one or more scaling paths.", "In orde r to develop an integrative analysis of the concept of scaling impact we will and summarize the classifications in the existing literature in three categories as presented in Table 1: qualitative, quantitative scaling through ecosystem growth and quantitat ive scaling through operational growth. Qualitative scaling encompasses every expansion in the scope of the activities of the organization increasing the longevity, areas, and level of impact. Quantitative scaling will focus on increasing numbers of impact ed communities and people. That type of scaling can take place in two ways, the first one happens when the organization increases their impact without expanding their own activity (ecosystem growth ), the other one by increasing the size of the operation, a ssisting more people or opening more locations (operational growth ).", "Table 1 - Categories of Scaling Impact", "Note. Organized by the Author Understanding what type of growth is achieved through a specific strategy, what type of scaling can be achieved with an organization’s existing resources or what sort of growth is desired by the actor (Blundel & Lyon, 2015) is key to understand the scaling process. Based on that, we advance the following propo sition:", "Proposition 1. The category of scaling impact achieved can determine the process of scaling impact or be limited by the process.", "2.2 Barriers and Challenges to Scaling", "There are several obstacles and barriers identified in the existing literature that can limit or prevent social innovations from scaling. These constraints can be both internal and external to the organization. The main barriers of the scaling process identified are related to th e limited access to resources, mainly financial and hum an resources, knowledge gaps, fragmented ecosystem, legal restrictions or insufficient political support , the challenge of ensuring quality while scaling (Mulgan, 2007; Caulier -Grice et al., 2010; Vickers & Lyon, 2014; Moore et al. , 2015; Howaldt et. al , 2016; Walske & Tyson, 201 5; Westley et al.", "Moore, Riddell and Vocisano        Increasing activities        Enhancing sustainability        Scaling out       Enhancing sustainability        Scaling up       Broadening indirect influence        Quantitative       Expanding coverage and size        Organizational       Enhancing sustainabilityQuantitative scaling:", "ecosystem growth       Breadth Impact        Political Quantitative scaling:", "operational growth       Breadth Impact        Scaling outDesa and Koch (2014)Uvin and Miller (1996)Uvin, Jain and Qualitative scaling       Depth Impact        Scaling deep        Functional Deiglmeier & Greco, 2018, Rayna & Striukova, 2019) , and avoid drifting from the core mission of the initiative (Siebold, Günzel -Jensen & Müller, 201 9; Ometto et al., 2019) . In the European commission’s project ‘Social Innovation: Driving Force of Social Change’ (SI -DRIVE) that investigated 1005 cases of social innovation initiatives worldwide, Howaldt et al. (2016) identified the lack of financial resources as a barrier for 39,4% of the initiatives , lack of human resour ces for 14% of the initiatives , knowledge gaps for 13,2%, the fragmented ecosystem for 17,4%, legal restrictions for 12,6% and lack of political support for 10,7%.", "The first main barrier , the limited access to resources is related not only to the absence of funds or capable personnel in the organization, but also the scarcity of such resources in the environment. Actors must find people with the right mindset and capabilities while considering budget constraints and competing with other organizations for the available financial resources (Frumkin, 2006; Deiglmeier & Greco, 2018; Han & Shah, 2019; Rayna & Striukova, 2019). Finding the right people to occupy positions depends on two distinct and time -consuming activities: (1) proper selection, and (2) trainin g and socialization. The first requires that the organization has a clear understanding of the skills required while the second, training and socialization will be used to fill any skill gaps and to share the culture of the program with the new personnel Funding is a central issue and can become a barrier even for long lasting and established organizations. The central challenges are securing long term funding and financial support for overhead expenses, especially for scaling processes (Ca ulier-Grice et al. , 2010; Deiglmeier & Greco, 2018). There are many reasons that motivate the lack of long-term funding , donor fatigue, the phenomenon of diminished response by donors because the problems never seem to diminish, the belief that equity requires splitting donations among different institutions or causes and an hesitance to make “big bets” (Bradach, 2003). Also, most of the funding, specially from institutions, governments and foundations tend to be restricted to specifi c projects and programs, not including overhead expenses (Eckhart -Queenan et al. , 2019).", "Knowledge gaps describe the lack of professional or expert knowledge, experience and know -how, difficulties to get access to required information or inefficient marke t information and missing technological possibilities (Howaldt et al, 2016). Knowledge gaps are a challenge for daily operations but become a large r barrier when it comes to scaling. The scarcity of information associated with the difficulty for actor s to access that information can prevent the process of scaling or, at least, increase its complexity (Caulier - Grice et al. , 2010).", "The fragmented ecosystem can also be described as an absence of networks intra and intersectoral. Engaging, collaborating, a nd coordinating actions with various actors from the private, nonprofit, and public sectors is of huge value. These networks potentialize organizations by legitimating their work, allowing them to share experiences, know -how and resources, and learn best p ractices at local, national and international level (Mulgan, 2007; Caulier -Grice et al. , 2010; Howaldt et al, 2016; Deiglmeier & Greco, 2018). Legal restrictions and insufficient political support are external factors that can impose financial and bureaucratic barriers for the organization. Political support can help actors support their scaling initiatives, especially when there is a concern from the government in the social issue addressed by the organization (Caulier -Grice et al. , 2010; Howaldt et al, 2016).", "Ensuring quality while scaling is a key concern, especially when the scaling process occurs with less control of the original organization (Bradach, 2010; Asemota & Chahine, 2017; Giudici et al., 2020). The legitimacy of a social innovation is determined by the perception of accumulated benefits and values (Scheuerle & Schmitz, 2016), lower quality can damage the perception of the hole organization, harming their overall reputation, credibility, and legitimacy, harming the organization’s abilit y of fundraising and losing partners. The core of scaling impact is to serve well more people and communities (Dees et al. , 2004), therefore, scaling the size or coverage of the operation is only valid if it maintains or increases the value delivered to th e multiple stakeholders (Siebold, 2020). Proposition 2. Internal and external barriers, related to the limited access to resources, knowledge gaps, fragmented ecosystem, legal restrictions, or insufficient political support, ensuring quality and mission -drifting can prevent or limit scaling processes.", "Organizations can overcome the previous barriers by investing in networks, exchanging knowledge, diversifying their funding, investing in communication to raise awareness, and consequently acquir ing more funding, volunteers, public and political support (Howaldt et al. , 2016). In the next section, we will focus on the resources and capabilities that will allow organizations to surpass the existing barriers and challenges and pursue their scaling initi atives.", "2.3 Resources and Capabilities f or Scaling", "Previous literature has identified multiple resources and capabilities necessary for organizations to scale their impact. We will divide them in three categories: (1) organization resources, (2) environmental conditions and (3) actor characteristics.", "2.3.1 Organization Resources", "First, to discuss the mobilization of resources, a key challenge in scaling social enterprises (Corner & Kearins , 2018) we are going to use t he SCALERS model developed by Bloom and Chatterji (2009) . It describe s seven organizational capabilities t hat stimu late successful scaling processes based on different situational contingencies. These seven drivers are: staffing, communicating, alliance -building, lobbying, earnings -generation, replicating and stimulating market forces , creating the acronym SCALERS. Staffing describe s the effectiveness of the organization at filling its labor needs, it encompasses both paid and voluntary workers, and measure how much of the necessary skills and capabilities required from the staff to support the scaling process are av ailable in the organization. Communicating is related to the ability of the organization to persuade key stakeholders of the importance of the scaling process, this driver measures the effectiveness of the communication resulting in support by both interna l and external stakeholders . Social ventures have a more complex stakeholder universe than commercial ventures, turning communication into a central factor for scaling (Gauthier, Ruane, & Berry , 2019). Alliance Building refers to the to the ability of the organization to forge partnerships, coalitions, joint ventures, and other linkages. Lobbying defines the ability of the organization to advocate for government actions that may that support the organization’s social cha nge efforts. Earnings -generation describe the ability of the organization to fund its activities . Replicating is related to the effectiveness with which the programs and initiatives can be replicated . Stimulating Market Forces , measures the ability of the organization in creat ing incentives and encourag ing people or institutions to pursue private interests while also serving the public good.", "Multiple researches have built on these drivers trying to determine the ir relevance in the process of scaling social impact and how organizations can develop such capabilities (Bloom & Smith, 2010; Lyon & Fernandez, 2012; Walske & Tyson, 2015; Gauthier, Ruane & Berry, 2019; Han & Shah, 2019; Zainol et al. , 2019) . In a quantitative analysis earnings generation has a relatively stronger effect than the other SCALERS, however when combined SCALERS explained 38% of the variance of the model in scaling of social impact (Bloom & Smith, 2010). Earning s generation, replicating, and stimulating market forces presented a positive strong relationship with scaling social impact in a quantitative analysis on social initiatives from Malaysia (Zainol et al. , 2019) . Walske and Tyson (2015) identified in their study made with eight social enterprises that grew exponentially in their first 5 years, that financial and human capital, media exposure , a combination of key partnerships and direct contact with clients, were relevan t factors that led to the scaling of those initiatives.", "Media exposure and social media presence help initiatives gain credibility, attract investors and partners , and positively change stakeholders’ behaviors and attitudes towards the organization (Walsk e & Tyson, 2015 ; Hue, 2017 ). Bradach (2003) highlighted how the visibility provided by public figures and media exposure has helped many social innovations scale, like Habitat for Humanity , an American NGO founded in 1976 focused on building affordable homes that grew with Jimmy Carter’s involvement since 1984 , developing a partnership and a special event that has attracted funds and volunteers for 35 years (Habitat for Humanity, 2019) , and STRIVE, an NGO that since 1984 has provided job training skills and assisted over 75.000 people find a job (STRIVE, 2020), that gained visibility after being featured in the popular television show, 60 minutes in 1997. After the analysis of the existing literature regarding organization resources required for scaling, we identified four main concepts: (1) organizational structure, that encompass all human resources and internal processes; (2) communication, including all media and the relationship with th e multiple stakeholders; (3) funding and (4) network, that combines all relevant connections, public and private, made in the ecosystem. Building on those studies we advance the following propositions:", "Proposition 3a. The organizational structure, that encompass all human resources and internal processes, of the organization can limit or direct the scaling initiative. Proposition 3b. The communication capability of the organization, including all the media presence and the relationship with the multiple stakeholders can limit or direct the scaling initiative.", "Proposition 3c. The funding capability of the organization can limit or direct the scaling initiative.", "Proposition 3d. The network of the organization, that combines all relevant connections, public and private, made in the ecosystem, can limit or direct the scaling initiative.", "2.3.2 Environmental Conditions", "Beyond the organization’s resources, the role of the external context is also a key aspect of the scaling process. Social organizations are subject to environmental conditions that can stimulate or constrain their growth (Bradach, 2010). Language barriers, cultural differences and attitudes, public acceptance, availability of resources, conditions of the natural environment, social economic conditions, and political and economic crises shape and alter an organization action and strategy ( Easter & Conway Dato -On, 2015; Howaldt et al. , 2016).", "The scarcity of social capital, financial and human resources in the environment and the competition for those resources influence the strategi cal choices and affect the sustainability of the organization and its social impact (Weerawardena & Mort, 2006; Bloom & Smith , 2010; Canatelli , 2017 ; Islam, 2020b; Van Lunenburg, Geuijen & Meijer , 2020). The relationship with the external environment also allows the organization to seek opportunities for improvement and change, experiment and adapt their innovations to different cultural and social economical contexts (Grant & Crutchfield, 2007; Corner & Kearins, 2018 ; Rayna & Striukova, 2019 ).", "The geographic area and its conditions can influence the development of social networks , including the relationship with the community and consequently the target audience. These relationships can be limited by the environment and can affect not only the selection of the scaling method but also the access to the actors with the required social power to allow the operation of the social i nitiative (Mair & Schoen, 2007; Smith & Stevens, 2010). The limitations of the geographic area become even more challenging when a social initiative is scaled to new locations, since an organization with more embedded community relationships can more effec tively tailor scaling strategies that fit the environment (Smith & Stevens, 2010 ; Guha, 2019 ).", "The importance of the social economical and geographical context and the proximity with the communities targeted by the organizations has increased the interest in social innovation and social entrepreneurship research in th e context of emerging countries (Rao -Nicholson, Vorle y & Khan, 2017). Emerging countries counts with a scarcity of skilled human capital , resources and funding, a lack of support from the government to NGOs and social initiatives, providing a rigid institutional context and even placing restrictions on overs eas financing and a highly uncertain environment (Weerawardena & Mort, 2006; El Ebrashi, 2018; Guha, 201 9; Maseno & Wanyoike, 2020 ). The context of developing countries provides a constrained environment with a high demand for social change with highly div erse geographical contexts that requires organizations to invest in building local networks and acquiring local insights that allow them to adapt, customize and diversify their offerings in order to produce locally meaningful impact (Braund & Schwittay, 20 16). Based on the existing literature on the influence of the external context we advance the following propositions: Proposition 4a. Environmental dynamics and conditions can constrain or direct scaling .", "Proposition 4b. Organizations must adapt, customize, and diversify their offerings when changing geographic contexts.", "2.3.3 Actor Characteristics", "The key factors of scaling go further than the organization and the environment and include the actor characteristics. The ability of entrepreneurs to identify and evaluate opportunities is a determinant factor for both start ing-up and scal ing social innovation . Moreover, scaling impact can sometimes be perceived as peripheral, or even a distraction from the core objective of the org anizations , (Uvin, Jain, Brown, 2000; Bradach, 2010 ; Perrini, Vurro & Costanzo, 2010 ), and consequently, the individual decision -making path and motivation appear as requirements for the expansion process (Ćwiklicki, 2019). Consequently, a ctor characteristics such as (1) the enterprise , that is the willingness to take on risks in order to obtain gain and, consequentl y the willingness to scale (Penrose, 1959 ; Tykkyläinen et al. , 2016 ), alongside their (2) desire of control ( Smith & Stevens, 2010; Lyon & Fernandez, 2012; Smith, Kistruck & Cannatelli, 2016), (3) the balance between their economic and the social logic (Braund & Schwittay, 2016 ; Siebold, Günzel -Jensen & Müller, 201 9), their (4) entrepreneurial skills , like the ability to make use and pursue scarce resources (Bacq et al. 2015) , to learn, adapt and adjust (Rangan & Gregg, 2019) and their (5) leadershi p abilities (Mastrangelo, Benitez, & Cruz -Ros, 2017 ; Han & Shah, 2019 ) are also relevant for the scaling process (Uvin, Jain & Brown, 2000; Scheuerle & Schmitz, 2016; Van Lunenburg, Geuijen & Meijer , 2020 ).", "The actor has a central role in the scaling process , and, consequently is the most studied topic of the social innovation literature . The level of enterprise of th e actor (Penrose, 1959; Tykkyläinen et al. , 2016) can be the main drive r of the scaling process , due to a moral urgency to scale their initiatives (Smith, Kistruck & Cannatelli, 2016) in order to achieve a wider and deeper impact on society (Bloom & Smith, 2010) or become a huge barrier for the process , if the actor decide to focus on one service offering to an specific local communit y, instead of broadening or expanding its impact . Social solutions can even scale their impact indirectly, spreading to other individuals or organizations, whether as an effect of a deliberate strategy of dissemination by the originating actor , leveraging on its network and other entrepreneurial skill s or through a natural process of diffusion (Wes tley & Antadze, 2010).", "The actor will also determine the logic of the whole scaling process. Scaling social impact can follow different logics depending on the actor’s characteristics (Corner & Ho, 2010; Fisher, 2012; Weerakoon, Gales & McMurray, 2019 ). Th e main logics are causation, effectuation (Sarasvathy, 2001) and entrepreneurial bricolage (Baker & Nelson, 2005). The causation logic follows the traditional market expansion logic, where the decision to scale is made first, and then the focus shift to developing and acquiring the necessary resources .", "However, in a resource constraint environment like the ones where social innovation tend to be implemented, (Janssen, Fayoelle and Wuilaume, 2018) the causation logic might not be the most adequate. Both the effectuation logic (Sarasvathy, 2001) and entrepreneurial bricolage (Baker & Nelson, 2005) leverages on the actor’s entrepreneurial abilities, especially his abilities to identify opportunities and make use and pursue scarce resources (Bacq et al. 2015). After the review of the existing research on the actor characteristics we can advance the following proposition:", "Proposition 5. The characteristics of the actor , like his enterprise, desire of control, balance of economic and social logic, entrepreneurial and leadership skills can guide or limit the scaling process.", "2.4 Strategic Pathways", "There are multiple strategies that can be used to scale social impact, each one of them allow a different degree of coordination and control and required a certain amount and types of resources ( Dees et al. , 2004 ; Mulgan, 2007; Westley & Antadze, 2010; Lyon & Fernandez, 2012; Westley et al. , 2014 ). These strategies include the dissemination and replication of general ideas, principals and programs by different actors, an ecosystem growth, the organic growth of the activity of a single actor, an operational growth, and the expansion of activities through both partnership and in-house developments . The ones that require the least amount of resources are also the ones where the organization has less control of the process ( Dees et al. , 2004; Mulgan, 2007; Westley & Antadze, 2010; Westley et al. , 2014), but are also the ones that can achieve higher impact (Frumkin, 2006; Lyon & Fernandez, 2012) .", "Dees, Anderson and Wei -skillern (2004) argue that scaling impact can be achieved by spreading a principle (dissemination) , replicating a program (affilia tion), or scaling an organization (branching) . Dissemination is the simplest strategy, normally the least resource intensive and with the lowest amount of control from the original actor . It consists of two approaches: advocacy and network expansion.", "Advo cacy consists of the actor sharing information and encouraging learning , that way other actors are impacted indirectly generating new activities. Network expansion has a little more control and requires more resources as it counts with a relationship between the multiple actors involved in order to share good practices and information, and in some cases even offer specific trainings and evaluations (Uvin & Miller, 1996; Frumkin, 2006; Mulgan, 2007; Bradach, 2010; Westley & Antadze, 2010; Lyon & Fernand ez, 2012; Narang et al. , 2014; Westley et al. , 2014).", "Affiliation, on the other hand, requires more control and coordination from the original actor and a systematized program that can be replicated by different actors (Westley et al. , 201 4). In this intermediate level of control and coordination we can include licensing and social franchising as pathways of replication. Licensing turns a program into a product that can be shared and its use by other authorized. Social franchising not only allows the use of the solution and operational processes but also the brand, the franchisor provides detailed and continuous guidance to the franchisee, in a contractual agreement to maintain performance and quality standards related to both processes and out comes (Mulgan, 2007; Asemota & Chahine, 2017; Giudici et al., 2020).", "Licensing and Franchising allows the initial actor to apply indirectly the same business model multiple times locally or globally (Narang et al. , 2014), while distributing the risk and the financing, however, the pricing of knowledge or a service can reduce its spread and consequently its social impact (Murray, Caulier -Grice & Mulgan, 2010). Branching consists of expanding the organization in ter ms of coverage and offerings. In order to expand its coverage, the actor can acquire other organizations, increase its capacity locally or expand to different sites. Expand ing offerings consists of diversifying the services provided to maximize the social impact of the existing capacity. Branching is the most resource consuming pathway and , consequently, the one where the actor maintains more control over the innovations and programs. (Uvin & Miller, 1996; Frumkin, 2006; Mulgan, 2007; Murray, Caulier -Grice & Mulgan, 2010; Westley & Antadze, 2010; Lyon & Fernandez, 2012; Narang et al. , 2014; Westley et al. , 2014) . Despite of the different resources needed, and amount of control maintained by the organization, none of the pathways are mutually exclusive, therefore, is possible for an actor to move forward along different strategies simultaneously or successively (Uvin. Jain & Brown, 2000). In Bocken, Fil and Prabhu’s (2016) cross -case analysis of three large - scale social businesses from Bangladesh and Indi a, indicated that the organizations had used almost all the different scaling methods at one point during their 20 years of operation. This shows how the different strategies can be complementary, being necessary for organizations to mix and match differen t pathways to successfully scale their impact.", "Proposition 6. The strategic pathway selected by an organization is related to the combination of existing resources of the organization, the characteristics of its leader and the environment.", "2.5 Integrative Analysis", "Scaling social impact becomes even more complex as the process can follow different logics (Corner & Ho, 2010; Fisher, 2012; Weerakoon, Gales & McMurray, 2019) : causation, effectuation (Sarasvathy, 2001) and entrepreneurial bricolage (Baker & Nelson, 2005). When following the causation logic, organizations have the effect, in this case, the scaled impact, as given and focus on defining and developing the means to achieve the effect desired . Using th e effectual logic, actors begin with their means: (1) who they are – their traits and abilities, (2) what they know – their education, training, and experience and (3) who they know – their social, professional and family networks. Leveraging on their human, intellectual, and soci al capital, they then elaborate and select possible effects (Sarasvathy, 2001). An example of an actor that uses effectual logic is given by Vansandt, Sud and Marme (2009) is Ashoka, that since its beginning has leverage on its knowledge, awareness, and ne tworks to scale their impact . Entrepreneurial b ricolage is accomplished by solving problems as they emerge, with the available means instead of focusing on developing the necessary means, the bricoleur practices radical experimentation rather than planning (Baker & Nelson, 2005). Bricolage is commonly used to explain the emergence and growth of endeavors in economically depressed, or resource -poor areas, what is commonly the scenario in which social innovation initiatives evolve (Janssen, Fayoelle and Wuilaume, 2018) . The diversity of logics behind the process of scaling social impact increases the relevance of an integrative overview of the scaling process. That way independent of the logic applied, practitioners can understand the factors involved an d the relationship among them. The existing literature has studied a n extensive range of factors involved in the process but is still highly fragmented . The purpose of this section is to combine the propositions made through in the literature review to develop an integrative framework that provides a comprehensive overview of the phenomenon of scaling social impact. Each actor decides to pursue a scaling strategy based on a combination of internal and external factors (Uvin. Jain & Brown, 2000) . The literature review showed how the literature on the subject is still very fragmented, with different authors discussing multiple factors and m ultiple forms of scaling social impact . Alongside the diversity of terms and definitions that prevents the advancement of established literature, there is still an absence of an integrative analysis that combines the multiple factors involved in t he decision to scale and the selection of the strategy , allowing the identification of the key factors involved in the process.", "This framework highlights the complex, multidimensional and dynamic nature of the process of scaling social impact and paves the way for understanding t he dynamics between those factors . Currently, the existing frameworks in t he literature fail to address the multiple logics involved in the scaling process (Corner & Ho, 2010; Fisher, 2012; Weerakoon, Gales & McMurray, 2019 ), limiting the dynamic interactions of the key factors. Another contribution of this framework is the inclusion of qualitative measures of impact , and consequently, building a comprehensive understanding of the phenomen . Impact measurement is a nother critical topic in the social innovation literature that has been gaining attention.", "Figure 2 – Multifactor Framework for Scaling Social Impact", "Source. Author (2021) The framework counts with four dimensions of analysis: categories of scaling impact, environmental conditions, organizational resources, and actor characteristics. The first one, categories of scaling, describes the outcome of the scaling process, it focus es on the change in social impact achieved, and can be qualitative, quantitative by ecosystem growth or by organizational growth. The other three dimensions act as both drivers and enablers of the scaling process. The four dimensions are placed around the strategic pathway to represent their roles as drivers or limiting aspects of the strategy. Since each pathway allows a different level of control and requires a different amount of resources, an actor with a high desire of control would limit the strategy selection to pathways like branching, however, that would require the organization to develop more resources to pursue such strategy. On the other hand, environmental conditions, like cultural or social economical differences can make harder for organizat ions to expand trough a branching or affiliation pathway, since it would require multiple adaptations, pushing the scaling process to dissemination. For an organization focused on qualitative scaling through organizational growth, branching would be the mo st suitable strategy, while for an ecosystem growth, affiliation and dissemination are more interesting. Due to the dynamic characteristic of the process of scaling social impact, any of the described factors can be the starting point of the process.", "For instance, under the logic of causation, practitioners already have selected an outcome, but still need to understand the resources, conditions and skills needed to achieve it (Fisher, 2012), that way the process will start in the scaling impact dimension and the other factors will be developed as necessary. In effectuation logic, the process starts with the existing resources and skills, it leverages on contingencies and strategic relationships, to discover new resources and establish a course of action bas ed on the possibilities offered by its available means (Sarasvathy, 2001; Fisher, 2012). Entrepreneurial bricolage, on the other hand, is motivate by the resource constraint environment and only counts with the resources at hand, leveraging its physical, institutional, or human resources in novel ways (Baker & Nelson, 2005; Fisher, 2012). The literature review allowed the development of theoretical propositions that originated the dimensions of the proposed framework, the relation between propositions and d imensions of the framework can be found on Table 2. The three dimensions of enablers : environmental conditions, organizational resources, and actor characteristics count with a combination of factors identified in the existing literature. Those factors, despite being enablers and motivators of the scaling process can, also, act as internal barriers of the organization. The absence of a required skill or capability or an unexpected environmental condition can constraint or, even, prevent the scaling process. Besides the potential internal barriers, the scaling process can also be constraint by external barriers and challenges.", "The purpose of the framework is to present a combination of different dimensions and factors involved in the process of scaling social impact. With an integrative framework, one can investigate the relations between distinct factors and strategies , make comparisons among distinct scaling strategies, different conditions, contexts, and resource levels, and identify potential areas of development. Consequently, t he proposed dimensions of the framework and the theoretical propositions are used in chapter 5 to categorize and analyze the data collected from the two case studies that are presented in sections 4.2 and 4.3.", "Table 2 - Relation between Dimensions and Propositions", "Dimension Variables Authors Proposition Categories of Scaling ImpactUvin & Miller, 1996 ; Uvin, Jain & Brown, 2000; Dees, Anderson & Wei-skillern, 2004; Bradach, 2010; Desa & Koch , 2014; Westley et al., 2014; Blundel & Lyon, 2015; Moore, Riddell & Vocisano, 2015; Islam , 2020aP1.

The first section outlines the research question and the auxiliary questions that are addressed in this work. Section 3.2 present the research design and details the research methods divided in two parts, the first one, theoretical and the second, empirical. The third section describes the project scope, the case selection, data collection and data analysis techniques and the research limitations.", "3.1 Research Question s", "The research question was based on the analysis of the established literature on social innovation. The current literature on both social innovation and social entrepreneurship has presented s caling social impact as a central topic (Bloom & Smith, 2010). Due to the magnitude of the problems, it addresses and its complexity, the process of scaling social innovation, and consequently, social i mpact remain s a relevant but understudied phenomenon (Dees et al., 2004; Cannatelli, 201 7; Islam, 2020a). The limited literature on how social initiatives scale combined with the global demand for solutions to social issues and unmet social needs motivated th is research on understanding the phenomenon of scaling social innovation. The goal of the research is to answer the question: How different actors can scale social innovation? The exploratory nature of the research question and the multidimens ional characteristic of the subject lead to the identification of four auxiliary specific questions that need to be addressed in order to develop a comprehensive overview of the phenomena and answer the main research question.", " What are the possible scaling strategies of social initiatives?  What are the drivers of the scaling process?", " What are the factors that can limit or prevent social initiatives to scale?  What are the external and internal factors that influence or determine the strategy selection ?", "3.2 Research Design", "The current work is designed as a qualitative research . A qualitative research allows the researcher to explore and understand a concept or phenomenon, being able to achieve a more comprehensive understanding of the phenomenon in a specific context . The qualitative approach is especially useful to determine which dimensions and variables are important to examine an understudied phenomenon or sample (Creswell, 2014) , which is the case of the present research . However, following a qualitative approach makes it harder to achieve a level of generalization of results than when following a quantitative method, especially due to specificity of the context and the difficulty to analyze large enough samples to achieve statistical relevance (Castellan, 2010) . The research is divided in two parts , one theoretical and the other empirical. Yin (2003) argues that the development of a theoretical framework for a case study, not only contributes to defining the research design and data collection but can also , be used t o develop broader theory . The first part focus in the development of a framework to provide a better understanding of the phenomenon and to be used to systematically analyze empirical data. This first part was based o n a systematic literature review that allow ed us to formulate propositions and elaborate the theoretical framework for analysis . The empirical part of the research is designed as a multiple case study. Case studies are a research design centered in an in-depth analysis of a case, event, activity, process, or one or more individuals through a variety of data collection procedures. A multiple case study enables the researcher to explore differences within and between cases with the objective of replicate findings across cases and identifying patterns to understand “how” the phenomenon of scaling happens inside each specific territorial context (Yin, 2003; Eisenhardt & Graebner, 2007) . As presented in section 1.2, due to the development potential, territorial importance and inequality rates of the country, this dissertation takes Brazil as the specific social economical and territorial context of both case studies. In the following sections, the case selection, data collection and analysis are descr ibed in more details .", "3.2.1 Theoretical", "Due to the fragmented literature on the topic across multiple areas of study, a systematic literature review was performed to identify central topics of the literature and integrate them (Creswell , 2014). This process of synthesiz ing the existing literature on the research topic , especially for emerging topics like the scaling of social innovation, enables new theoretical frameworks and perspectives to emerge (Torraco, 2005). The first step of the literature review was determining a set of keywords to locate articles relevant to the social innovation context, while taking in consideration the diversity and ambiguity of terms and definitions existent in the literature. W e develo ped a set of keywords that included the terms : “social innovation”, “social innovators”, “social enterprise”, “social entrepreneur”, “social entrepreneurship”, “social business”, “social impact” and “NGO” , as we understood that those keywords could encompa ss the multiple definitions and actors involved in the social innovation process. To select documents related to the scaling process that is the central topic of the research, we developed a complementary set of keywords that included : “scaling”, “scalabil ity” and “scale”. This database selected for the data collection was Scopus, Elsevier’s database launched in 2004 that counts with over 24,600 active titles and 5,000 publishers (SCOPUS, 2020). We, then, adjusted the keywords to ensure the comprehensiveness of the research, using the wildcard (*) that represents any number of characters, and, consequently reducing the keywords to “social innovat*”, “social entrepr*”, “social enter*”, “social busi ness”, “social impact”, “NGO” and “scal*”. The search was made using the article title, abstract or keywords feature of the database, and included documents with any of the first set of keywords (“social innovat*”, “social entrepr*”, “social enter*”, “soci al business”, “social impact”, “NGO”) AND “scal*” with no time period restrictions. This search resulted in 3.546 documents . In the document type refinement, we limited the category to articles, resulting in 2.609 articles, the results showed an increase i n article production on the area over time, as showed in Figure 3. Figure 3 - Articles per year (1996 -2020)", "Note. Query: \"social innovat*” OR \"social entrepr*\" OR \"social enter*\" OR \"social business\" OR \"social impact\" OR \"NGO\" AND \"scal*\" In another refinement in the categories of Scopus, we limited the results to the areas of “management” and “business” to exclude the documents that did not provide insights on the phenomenon of scaling social impact, resulting in 434 articles. We, then, did an analysis of the titles and abstracts of all the resulting articles to determine which ones were inside of the scope of the research. Articles were removed if they did not discuss the scaling process. This left a total of 76 articles .", "The total 76 articles were then read and coded. A descriptive coding p rocess summarizes in a word or short phrase the basic topic of a passage of qualitative data (Saldaña, 2013) . The codes that emerged in this stage were: (1) impact, (2) barriers, (3) resources , (4) capabilities , (5) actor characteristics, (6) environment and ( 7) strategies. 36 articles were removed after this stage, since they did not provide insights on the phenomenon of scaling social impact, its strategies, challenges, or drivers. Leaving a total of 40 articles.", "To ensure that all relevant literature was included in the analysis, we adopted a snowball sampling technique, that produces a network of relevant articles built around the citations on the original sample (Lecy & Beatty, 2012) complementing the s ampl e until data saturation (Naderifar, Goli & Ghaljaei, 2017) . Through this process a nother 27 new documents, being 23 articles , 2 books (Penrose, 195 9; Frumkin, 2006) and 2 reports (Caulier -Grice et al. , 2010; Howaldt et al. , 2016) that met the criteria of the review were included . Therefore, the fin al sample contained a total of 67 documents , all coded through a descriptive process . The distribution of articles through time showed on Figure 4, highlight s the emergency and growing interest on the topic of scaling social innovation . Figure 4 – Selected articles per year (1996 -2020)", "Note. Author The 67 selected articles came from 36 different sources, a consequence of both the multidimensional characteristic of the phenomenon and the lack of a generalized established literature on the topic. As we can observe in Figure 5, the largest source of data regarding the scaling of social innovation comes from the Journal of Social Entrepreneurship.", "Figure 5 – Selected documents per source", "Note. Author", "The coded articles were then, organized in four central topics: (1) scaling impact, (2) barriers, (3) resources and capabilities for scaling, and (4) strategic pathways , that were divided in 6 dimensions of analysis (categories of scaling impact, barriers, organization resources, environmental conditions, actor characteristics and strategic pathways) . Some documents were included in more than one dimension, in Figure 6, we can see the distribution of documents per di mension. The graph highlights the importance of the role of the actor in the literature of scaling social innovation. Figure 6 - Distribuition of the selected documents per dimension", "Note. Author", "After the selected literature was coded and organized, the data obtained from the literature review was used to advance 10 theoretical propositions related to each of the previous dimension and buil d a framework . The framework , presented in section 2.5, summarizes the 10 propositions and six dimensions presented throughout chapter 2 , being a helpful tool to specif y the key variables that influence the phenomenon of scaling social innovation and highlight the need to better understand the dynamics among them.", "3.2.2 Empirical", "Case studies are empirical inquiries that investigates a phenomenon within its context, the goal of the case study is understanding the dynamics present in the studied phenomenon, treating the context as a relevant factor to the phenomenon (Eisenhardt, 1989; Yin, 2003). T his approach is fitted to study under researched complex phenomena (Eisenhardt & Graebner, 2007) like the phenomenon of scaling social innovation. The central limitations of the case study approach are the difficulty to develop generalizable results and t o establish causation connections to reach conclusions, especially due to the reduced number of cases analyzed (Yin, 2003; Castellan, 2010). The multiple case study approach minimizes those limitations constructs and relationships are more precisely deline ated due to th e larger amount of empirical data characteristic of the multiple -case study approach (Eisenhardt & Graebner, 2007).", "On this research we analyze two different cases of Brazilian NGOs that have successfully scaled their social innovation throughout their history. The research follows a replication logic for multiple -case studies , where cases are selected through theoretical sampling (Eisenhardt & Graebner, 2007) to predict similar, a literal replication, or contrasting results, a theoretic al replication (Yin, 2003). The case study counts with t he organization as the unit of analysis and pr imary and secondary data were collected from multiple sources , following a triangulation method.", "The replication approach to multiple -case studies illust rated on Figure 7 consists of three main steps, the first one is define and design, encompassing the stages of theory development, case selection and the design of the data collection protocol of both primary and secondary data. The second step consists of conducting the cases and writing individual reports. In a multiple -case study is necessary to treat each case as an individual complete case, indicating in the individual reports how and why a proposition was demonstrated or not. The case studies can lead to important discoveries that could require reconsidering the theoretical propositions and redesigning the data collection protocol, creating a feedback loop between the first two steps. The third step consists of developing a cross -case analysis indicati ng the replication logic and the rationale behind the predicted results (Yin, 2003) .", "Figure 7 - Replication approach to multiple -case studies", "Following Yin’s (2003) case study protocol, we have summarize d the five components of research design: questions, propositions, units of analysis, logic linking data to propositions, and criteria for interpretation.

Organization Resources", "What are the external and internal factors that influence or determine the strategy selection?Environmental Conditions Actor Characteristics", "3.3 Research scope", "This work aims at understanding how different actors scale social innovation. To answer this research question, this work proposes an analysis of the main factors involved in the scaling strategy selection and process. The analysis was made in the Brazilian context , an emergent country with a high level of social inequality, and consequently , a high demand for social innovation . Brazil presents institutional and political barriers that can affect the process of scaling social innovation, being a relevant context to be explored.", "The research was limited to young organizations , with around 6 years of operation . The shorter time frame facilitates the collection of data regarding the scaling process of the organizations and the shared period facilitates the comparison for the cross -case analysis . The analysis only includes organizati ons that have successfully scaled their impact since foundation, since the main interest of the research is to determine “how” the process of scaling takes place. As defined in section 2.1, s caling impact throughout this research encompass the expansion of both beneficiaries, geographical locations, and service offerings, englobing both depth and breadth of impact (Desa & Koch, 2014).", "3.3.1 Case selection", "The selection of cases is an important aspect in hypothesis -testing ( Eisenhardt , 1989). For a replication mul ti-case study, a theoretical sampling is a fitted approach to case selection. Theoretical sampling consists of the selection of cases based on their capacity for illuminating and extending relationships and logic among constructs (Eisenhardt & Graebner, 2007).", "Taking in consideration the importance of selecting comparable and complementary cases and the relevance of the context of the case for the analysis, the selection required that cases shared a similar social -economical and geographical context. Oth er commonalities selected to ensure that the cross -case analysis provided comparable results were the political and institutional context , in this case by selecting organizations that started their operations in the same period and have similar . Through this selection criteria we could minimize the impact of the external factors of each case and focus on their specific characteristics, achieving both literal and theoretical replication.", "To ensure that t he cases shared economic, political, institutional, and cultural characteristics , we limited the case selections to one geographic area and period. Thus, both cases selected are Brazilian NGOs that started their activities in 2014 and have more than two employees . Due to the scope of the research, only cases that have successfully expanded their operation , at least once, in a qualitative or quantitative perspective were selected. According to IBGE (2020) only 10% of NGOs in Brazil have more than two employees and only the percentage drops to 2,5% when excluding religious organizations and professional associations. Thus, the number of employees can be used as an indicator of relevance and size of an NGO , and consequently, as an indicator of organizational growth. To offer different insights, the cases selected are classified in different areas and have different service offerings and beneficiaries. The selected NGOs after the definition of research criteria are Litro de Luz and Projeto RUAS . Litro de Luz is a Braz ilian NGO that is part of an international movement that provides sustainable lighting solutions for communities without access to electricity in more than 20 countries since 2012 . However, Litro de Luz only started its activities in Brazil in 2014 . Litro de Luz currently counts with five employees , its headquarter is located in São Paulo, in the southeast region of Brazil and is classified as part of the development, advocacy and human rights category .", "Also located in the southeast of Brazil, the region w ith the largest concentration of NGOs (IBGE, 2020), Projeto RUAS is an NGO dedicated to the assistance, support, and recovery of homeless people. Since it started in Rio de Janeiro in 2014, Projeto RUAS has been constantly increasing not only their geographical area, but also their project offerings . RUAS became an official NGO in 2016 and is classified in the social assistance category. Currently, RUAS counts with 3 full -time employees managing their operation and fundraising activities.", "3.3.2 Data Collection", "Case studies can accommodate multiple data sources, including sources of primary data, interviews, direct observations and participant -observation, and secondary data, like archival data, survey data and documents (Eisenhardt & Graebner, 2007 ). According to Yin (2003), the three principles of data collection are: using multiple sources, creating a case study database, and maintaining a chain of evidence. Validity is one of the main issues regarding qualit ative research, therefore, to ensure the construct validity, is necessary to follow these three rules regarding the data collection . Through the combination of data from multiple sources, we can triangulate the methods (Runeson and Höst, 2009). Triangulation consists of searching converging findings from different sources, reducing the bias from the research, and increas ing construct validity (Yin, 2003). In this research we collect ed primary data through semi -structured interviews , the official website, reports and observations of the posts of the organizations in social media . Secondary data w as collected through the articles in the media , videos and awards . A semi -structured interview consists of a list of themes and questions to be covered, while maintaining more open -ended questions than a structured interview, and allowing the emergence of questions and discussion with the interviewee rather than a straightforward question and answer format. Interviews were conducted with Vitor Belota and Laís Higashi from Litro de Luz, respectively the founde r of the organization and current member of the advisory board, and the founder of the São Paulo cell and current president of the organization, and with Larissa Montel, manager of Pr ojeto RUAS and one of the three employe es of the NGO . All interviewees are responsible for the strategical planning and decision making of the organizations . The interviews were about 45 minutes long and were recorded and transcribed with the permission of the interviewees to successfully collect and analyze the data. The interview script can be found in ANNEX 1. The data collected encompass ing both the primary and secondary sources listed in Table 4 was used to build a database that was later coded and ana lyzed.", "Table 4 - Data Sources", "Note.

In ANNEX 2, you can find the relation between dime nsions of analysis and the interview questions.", "4 CASE STUDIES", "4.1 The Brazilian Context for Social Innovation", "Brazilian economy has experienced significant changes in its’ economic profile and growth rates. In a combination of currency stabilizing policies , a growth in the e xport of agricultural, mining and a few manufactured products, such as the medium -sized commercial airplanes produced by Embraer, and social policies that provided monetary support to the poor expanded and consolidated the national consumer market. This scenario expanded the middle class and created an opportunity for a new social class to enter the market , however, there were still 40 million Brazilians living below the poverty line. However, a fter 2013 with the Brazilian political and econo mic crisis resulted in a growth in the unemployment rate and in the size of the population living below the poverty line, reaching over 50 million Brazilians in 2019 (IBGE, 20 20), deepening social problems like rampant crime , child labor and school dropout rates.", "According to the Human Development Index, considering the data for the year 2019, released by the UN, Brazil lost five positions in the overall ranking, going from 79th to 84th, Brazil ranks as the 8th -worst position in income inequality, behind o nly African nations. This result reflects the concentration of richness, the poor public management of resources and corruption scandals, that deepens social issues, like the lack of access to basic public services and rights. These major social challenges create a demand for social innovation.", "Brazil is the largest economy in Latin America and has one of the 10 largest GDPs in the world, has a high rate of entrepreneurship, with 38% of its population between 18 and 64 involved in entrepreneurial endeavors (Greco et al. , 2018), and a ccording to the Global Innovation Index , Brazil has a score of around 32, occupying an intermediate position and ranking second in innovation quality among the middle -income economies , behind only China (Spinosa, Schlemm & Reis, 2015) . Currently, the fiscal crisis jeopardized the progress made in recent decades, reducing the level of public investment in R&D to less than it was 20 years ago (Cornell University, INSEAD, and WIPO, 2020). This combination o f inequality, economic potential, entrepreneurship, and innovation rates contribute to the creation of an ecosystem for the development of social innovation (Santana & Silva, 2015).", "The social innovation ecosystem in Brazil has been mainly centered on NGO s focusing on filling the gaps left by the government in areas like education, health and poverty alleviation (Anastacio, Filho & Marins, 2018) , however, from the almost 800 thousand civil society organizations (OSC) in Brazil, 40% are located in the south east region, 12% are religious organizations, 83% have no paid employees and 7% have up to two paid employees (Lopez, 2018). The non -profit sector still faces many challenges specially when it comes to funding. Historically, we know that Brazilian philanth ropy was financed by international cooperation and private international foundations, however the strengthened economy and internal wealth, changed funders perspectives and began to direct their investments to poorer countries, increasing the need to stren gthen the philanthropic field in Brazil (Mortari, 2020). Corruption scandals , difficulties in communication and the lack of transparency have contributed to increase public distrust toward NGOs . On top of that, the lack of legal and fiscal benefits reduces the attractiveness of corporate and personal donations , contribut ing to the country’s 122nd position in the World Giving Index (Renaut, 2019).", "4.2 Litro de Luz", "Energy poverty is a distinct form of poverty that encompass access to adequate warmth, cooling, lig hting, and the energy to power appliances that are essential to guarantee a decent standard of life (Energy Poverty Observatory, 2020). According to the World Bank, over 10% of the world population had no access to electricity in 2018, some of these commun ities are completely remote and do not have access to electricity grids . However, the issue goes beyond the access to electricity since there’s also people that have access to it but cannot use it due to the high cost associated with this resource. Light contributes to the performance of domestic activities and decreases the frequency of violence and sexual abuse, since there is a higher incidence of those crimes in dark places (Jones, 2016; Tod & Thompson, 2016) In 2002 after several blackouts in his town, Alfredo Moser, a Brazilian mechanic developed a low -cost light tube that refracted solar light providing interior lighting using plastic bottles, water, and a small amount of bleach to avoid the proliferation of microorganisms on th e water and increase the duration of the lamp (Zobel, 2013). Illac Diaz, founder of the Philippine non -profit social enterprise, My Shelter Foundation, an organization that aims at offering sustainable building solutions for underprivileged communities and storm -damaged areas, came across the bottle -light technology in 2005 during his studies in alternative architecture and urban planning at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). After seeing videos of the solution being used to light poor and sto rm-damaged houses in Haiti, Diaz decided to develop an open -source DIY program that could be easily replicated by anyone around the world (World Habitat, 201 6). In January 2011, Illac Diaz launches the Liter of Light project in the Philippines through My Shelter Foudation. Within 20 months of its launch, Liter of Light became a global movement benefiting more than 150,000 households in the Philippines and starts expanding to other coun tries following a network strategy . Liter of Light used its website and social media, like Facebook, Youtube, Twitter and Instagram to inspire new initiatives and share how to build and assembly the solar light bulbs. Currently t he project has been replica ted in Bangladesh, Brazil, Colombia, Dominican Republic, Egypt, India, Italy, Kenya, Mexico, Nepal, Netherlands, Nicaragua, Pakistan, Spain, Switzerland and United Kingdom via partnerships with independent social enterprises that raise their own funds to run the project in their respective areas. The local organizations benefit from the stablished brand, the network, and the shared knowledge, while each chapter develops its own operations and programming. Some chapters work mainly as fundraisers for operations in different countries, while others operate at a local level (World Habitat,", "4.2.1 Creation and Early Operation of “Litro de Luz” in Brazil (2013 -2015) In 201 3, after returning from a volunteer work experience in Nairobi, Kenya, Vitor Belota contacted Illac Diaz to develop a c hapter of the program in Brazil. During his period as a volunteer teacher in Kenya, Belota noticed that the classrooms had insufficient lig ht for students and teachers to work, that was when he had his first contact with the bottle lamp technology , after learning about the process, Belota and a group of friends made 140 installations in over 14 public schools .", "“I met this technology when I we nt to do an exchange by AISEC in Kenya, in Nairobi. I went there to teach, and it turned out that the school I worked for was very dark, and me and some friends we did a project there to illuminate the local schools”", "After getting the approval by Illac Di az to use the brand name , Vitor Belota reache d out to Allana Souza and Pedro Santos, that had previously contacted Diaz to start the project in Brazil, and a month later they start to install bottle lamps on the roof of some houses in the city of Florianópolis where the three of them lived. According to Belota, Illac explained him that Litro de Luz would be an independent organization:", "“when I talked to Illac, I understood that I was going to have full autonomy to do what I wanted, because we do n ot have a headquarter of Liter of Light in the world. The only thing we have is a signed term of agreement with Illac (…) saying that he authorizes the use of the brand here for Brazil. But there is no kind of hierarchy, we do not report them anything, the re is no kind of royalties to use the name, there is nothing, if tomorrow I want to do a project Liter of Light, where I'll be building surfboards made of pet bottle, he won’t even know.” According to Belota, i n the early stages of the operation, Litro de Luz counted only with bottle lamps that refracted light, working only during the day , and they only had access to communities located in the urban area of Florian ópolis, where indoor lighting was not an issue, since the population either had access to regular electricity or benefited from illegal electrical connections. At that point, they decided to stop the operations, replan the activities , dedicate some time to better understand the electricity demands and how to approach new communiti es and make changes in their approach.", "Developing a new solution . After participating in a TETO operation in the community of Vila Bira Mar in Rio de Janeiro, Belota asked the community representative , Zélia, that was working with them about their lighting needs and identified that their biggest demand was related to the lack of light in the small street that connected one side of the community with the main avenue during the night and in the early morning. At the time, multiple Liter of Light chapt ers were already starting to develop nighttime technology. Using the global Liter of Light network, Belota contacted the Pakistan chapter to learn from their projects and to get their models . Since, he was living in Brasília, he decided to partner with ENE TEC, the junior enterprise of electrical engineering from U nB to develop Litro de Luz ’s own nighttime technolog y free of charge and using the laboratories of the university.", "A new organizational structure. At the time, Litro de Luz had around 9 members. The whole organization was composed of volunteers that were personal friends with the founders. According to Belota t he informal structure of the volunteer work presented issues like low performance and commitment. Simultaneou sly, Litro de Luz was getting attention and engaged people started reaching out to Belota to participate or start local Litro de Luz projects across the country .", "“there was a culture that volunteering did not need to be taken seriously, and it was very bad, because the very engaged people who entered the team, in two weeks already saw how it was the culture and were swallowed by the culture. This culture of non -delivery, and that was very frustrating, then, when I decided that this was going to be really a profession for me, I had a serious conversation with the team, at the time we had about nine people on the team, and of those nine, seven people left after the conversation.” The new organizational structure counted with two people working on the national level, one of them being Vitor Belota that was still the president of Litro de Luz, and two local cells coordinated by two people each, one in Brasília and one in Rio de Janeiro. The cells had a lot of autonomy to organize their own activities and volunteers , while the focus of Belota was raising funds to support the organization .", "At the time we had money for nothing, then I managed to capture 15 thousand dollars with Ilac, which was ... He had this foundation that called My Shelter Foundation, which took care of the Liter of Light in the Philippines, and then he gave 15,000 doll ars, and then I got another donation here in Florianópolis, about two or three donations, which totaled around 20 thousand, and even then, this was very little for the rhythm that we wanted, for the projects that we wanted to play, mainly night lighting.", "The first large operation and the start of a new growth stage. Litro de Luz first action using the newly developed nighttime technology was carried out in June 2015 in Rio de Janeiro, in the community of Vila Beira Mar in Duque de Caxias , with the installa tion of 28 lampposts in the small street that connected one side of the community with the main avenue . This operation was focused on the demand raised by the community representative during Belota’s earlier experience with the TETO operation. The whole operation was documented in both video and photos to ensure quality audiovisual material that could be used to advertise the organization and capture resources. A new cell starts in São Paulo coordinated by Laís Higashi and Leonardo Uematsu. “It was at this moment that Litro de Luz began to take off, that's when we took the first photos, we always focused in collecting good audiovisual materials, so we filmed, we took several pictures, and then that helped us to capture resources. ”", "Service offerings to diversify funding. In order to diversify its funding, Litro de Luz started with service offerings targeted at companies: the corporate volunteering action, the solution -building workshop, and the sponsored actions. In the first two services employees of the companies act as volunteers, they are trained by the Litro de Luz ambassadors and team and can learn how to build a solution that will later be donated to a community. The corporate volunteers can also participate in the setup in the communi ty and can teach the residents how to build the solutions. In the last service, Litro de Luz develops the whole solution in a geographical region relevant for the company, bringing social impact, improving the relationship between the company and the resid ents, the results of environmental compensation on impact report, and the company’s public image. In those services, Litro de Luz engage residents, teach the residents to build the solutions and install them in the community alongside the residents.", "“At the time, I was working at Yunus, so I was already looking at social business, I wanted Litro to be self -sufficient, that we did not depend on donations to survive. And we already had some examples of other chapters in the world that acted a little like this, that already generated their own income, a specific one was the chapter in Colombia, they already had a mindset of selling services . And then I told Laís what my vision was, and Laís had just come back from Bangladesh, where she had met Yunus too, so we c ame from that same school, more or less... And she also said : \"that's what I want,\" (..) so we always had this idea that Litro de Luz in an ideal setting would be responsible for all its revenue. Of course, after wards we evolved and understood that we did not have to pick one or the other, you can do both , which is the vision that we have today . (…) we already had this vision from the beginning, to transform Litro, not necessarily in a social business, but to sell serv ices, products, so that it could be as self - sustainable as possible”", "In the end of 2015, Litro de Luz hold its first corporate volunteering action with Airbnb. The action took place in Vila Moraes in São Bernardo do Campo and was partially funded by the company . The main objective of this partnership was to start Litro de Luz service portfolio. The action took place in three stages, ending in November 2016 with a total of 50 lampposts installed, around 30 volunteers and over 2 thousand people impacted. Th is action was also filmed and documented.", "International recognition and a new economical stage . With the successful development of the nighttime technology and the financial restraints for expansion, Belota submitted Litro de Luz for the St. Andrews Prize for The Environment, an award from the Saint Andrews University in Scotland that recognizes significant contributions to environmental conservation in the developing world.", "“we were selected to go to the final, and then in the final alre ady ... Third and second place already earned $25,000. And the first one made $100,", "000. 25 thousand dollars would already allow us to make the trip to the", "Amazon, that we wanted to go to the riverside communities. ” With the prize money, Litro de Luz woul d be able to fund an operation in the Northern region of Brazil that accounted for the largest population without access to electricity. Belota went to Scotland for the final selection phase, where he had to present the solution and be evaluated by the jud ging committee. Litro de Luz received the first place and won USD100.000,00. At the same time, they had won a BRL30.000,00 from Brazil Foundation and had closed a project with the French multinational Saint -Gobain. This growth in financial resources signal ized the beginning of a new stage for Litro de Luz. At that moment, Belota decided it was time to step down as president of Litro de Luz and invited Laís Higashi, the leader of the São Paulo cell, to take over.", "4.2.2 Change in Leadership and Expansion (2016 -2020)", "A new organizational structure to support the growth . Litro de Luz was reaching a stage that required a more robust and professional structure. After being invited to become president of the organization, Laís Higashi had the challenge to stru cture the organization and its business model. With almost BRL500.000 in the bank account, Litro de Luz created a financial department, lead by a volunteer director, to manage the funds and deal with the accounting. The lawyer Lucas Macedo was invited to be the director of the legal department and assist in the bureaucratic procedures for the presidential transition . According to Macedo, the legal departme nt is responsible for analyzing contracts, potential contests, dealing with societal and regulatory requirements, registering trademarks and intellectual property, and managing the compliance program to ensure the organization transparency. The new organizational structure counted with a board of directors composed only of volunteers, including the presi dent. The second big change in the organization structure was the development of structured volunteering program, that counts with a thorough selection process , a minimum amount of hours dedicated weekly for the organization, monthly meetings, special tra inings and periodical assessments. This structure allows the organization to manage their 200 volunteers across Brazil. The volunteers work in recurrent activities in one of the 7 departments of the organization: commercial, human resources, legal, social development, finance, marketing and operations and technologies.", "“We've always had a lot of volunteers, however volunteering isn't well organized, and often the organization can’t grow (…) it becomes a mess, we struggled to develop a culture that people who enter are well selected, we do selection process, that is super competitive, to understand who has the right profile, who really matches with our values, commitment (...) understand how to keep this person for a minimum time that makes sense to us. So, today we have a very mature model of volunteering that really adds to Litro and to the person, it is an exchange that makes a lot of sense, but we struggled a lot to get, to find this balance.”", "New product development. In this phase, Litro de Luz developed a new product called Lampião , a portable solution capable of lighting both internal and external environments . This new solution was developed for remote places , like the riverside communities in the Amazon. With the Lampião, the solution portfolio of Litro de Luz is composed of thre e solutions: the lamppost , that provides light for public areas, and consists of a combination of PET bottle, solar panel, battery, LED lamps and PVC pipe; the Moser lamp, the original solution developed by Moser that works only during the day and consists of a PET bottle, water, and bleach and the Lampião, made of PET bottle, solar panel, battery, LED lamps and a PVC pipe.", "New awards and establishing the business model. In 2017, Litro de Luz received a grant of BRL50.000 from Fundação Banco do Brasil de Tecnologia Social, after winning in the category of sustainable cities and digital innovation. The grants and donations helped Litro de Luz fund their operations, but they were focusing their efforts into developing a more stable income focused o n the service offerings for companies. “at first we relied a lot on punctual donation, we could not hire anyone, so it was very difficult to professionalize things, we had many volunteers, and it was difficult to work with everyone for enough time, at the same time without anyone hired, and without having a very clear model, it was all a mess, we had to understand each other and make a model that worked, then find a model (…) we realized that companies have an interest in corporate volunteering and workshop , which is another thing that we do, (…) the company, for example, makes a workshop of 50 lampiões with their employees, it fund the materials, and then we take to a community. So that's another thing we do a lot. (…) to realize that companies h ad interest , that they would pay for it, how much they would pay for it, it took some time, like, two years, at least for us to have this more structured and know how much we w ould charge and such, and get partnerships and grow, so this part of finding the model and getting a client, was very difficult .”", "The main clients ended up being the electricity distribution concessionaries, due to the national energy efficiency program created by The Brazilian Electricity Regulatory Agency (ANEEL) that determines that part of the profit of each concessionary be invested towards projects that demonstrate the importance and economic viability of improving the energy efficiency of equipment, processes , and final uses of energy. The goal of this legislation is to maximize the public benefits of energy saved and avoided demand, promoting the transformation of the energy efficiency market, stimulating the development of new technologies and the creation o f rational habits and practices for the use of electricit y (ANEEL, 20 20).", "Media exposure and advertising materials . Litro de Luz continue to count with professional photographers and filmmakers to produce quality audiovisual material to be used in the organization’s media platforms, their own website, YouTube channel, Facebook page and Instagram account, and awards and comme rcial presentations for fundraising. Belota highlighted the video production during their first operations in the Kalunga quilombola community and in Amazonas as a key factor to increase the organization awareness and media exposure. “we took a friend of mine, Bruna, that i s a filmmaker for Cana l Off, she made a video, so beautiful for us. And we used this video for many years, to this day so ... Bruna's made a lot of our videos . In the actions with the Kalunga, Bruna went to shoot, in the second action of the Amazon, Bruna went to shoot, and then our videos were of such quality that at tract Globo (…) Globo showed our videos in local newspapers, then in the second action of Amazonas , Globo took a team of Fant ástico, the team stayed there with us, sleeping with us, filming. ”", "Litro de Luz was featured in multiple television programs of Brazil’s largest television network, Globo, and in multiple local and national newspapers . According to the Ibope data, the organization estimates that around 50 million people were reached through Litro de Luz media appearances. As of the end of 2020, the organization had over 23.000 followers on Facebook, 15 .000 on Instagram and 1 .400 on YouTube , as portrayed in Figure 9.

When Laís took office, we were very big from the point of view of people seeking the organization , because (…) TED opened many doors for me to give lectures all over Brazil ... So, we even joked about it at the time, which was like this, I gave a lecture, for, I don't know,", "400 people in Santa Maria, the other day there were about 20 people", "wanting to open a cell in Santa Maria. And that was helping us a lot, so, for example, we open ed a cell in the northeast, we have a cell in Paraíba, which was a cell that was opened because of a lecture that I gave there. ”", "A community based o peratio nal model and a certified social development methodology . From 2016 to 2017, the organization developed their own methodology called “O Nosso Jeito”. Their social development methodology, that was certified by Fundação Banco do Brasil encompass the processes of search, selection, relationship building and action that take place within the communities served with Litro de Luz lighting solutions. The process is divided into four phases: prospection and selection ; local approach; leadership strengthening; action, celebration, and analysis. The first phase consists in prospecting and identifying potential communities. In order to map potential communities to operate in, Litro de Luz count with recommendations from partner NGOs, suggestions from companies that hire their services and even pers onal recommendations by community members.", "“we map them because people indicate, so, I don't know, someone comes on our Facebook and suggest, but often we look through other NGOs partnerships. So TETO, for example, is our super partner, they already worke d with several communities (..) they indicate to us, \"such community needs light, we already know the leadership\", and such, and then it facilitates our work. We do the same with other organizations, like, in the Amazon and such, we always talk to other NG Os that work there. And then, sometimes too, like we do... We also sell services to Companies. So, for example, the company has a plant, a factory, like, in the interior of Bahia, which has communities around it that need lighting. Then we go there, like, do our normal work of social development, engagement, and installation of solutions, and ends up improving the relationship of the company with the residents too.”", "The communities are then analyzed considering legal aspects, the community real needs, if the solar energy solutions offered by them are adequate to address the demands and the interest of residents to participate in the process. Th e methodology includes analysis frameworks that are filled in with information from both the residents or local organizations and volunteers from Litro de Luz. The frameworks are used to classify communities regarding impact opportunities and risks.", "Afterwards, Litro starts to build a relationship with the approved communit ies through presentations and meetings the c ommunity becomes more aware and involved in the process, while the volunteers immerse themselves in the community to understand the routine of the community and their real needs and pain points. During this phase, the organization develop a proposal for th e community and invite the more engaged residents to become ambassadors.", "Ambassadors are essential to maintain a relationship before, during and after the action. These residents become the direct channel of communication between volunteers and the commun ity. During phase three, they develop their communication skills, empathy, leadership and are trained by specialized technicians of the organization, who teach not only how to fix small defects in the use of these products, but also to protect themselves s o that accidents do not occur. Higashi highlights the importance of stablishing a connection with the community, engaging and empowering residents who, together with the organization take care of the installed solutions daily, providing an effective soluti on and operation.", "“we discovered that it is necessary to form ambassadors in the community who are representatives of the Liter of Light to do maintenance, to really empower the solution, take care of the solution, to act as points of communication between us and the community, so we developed a methodology of social development that involves the creation of ambassadors, inside of the community, to build the solutions.” The fourth p hase focuses on the preparations and the installation of the solutions . During this phase there is the delivery and installation of solutions in the community, a celebration with the community , this moment is used to signalize the commitment of all with the residents and especially the ambassadors with the installed solutions and the organization. The final step of the methodology is to monitor the solution through regular visits and communication with the ambassadors, a nalyze the results and develop insights to improve the operation. The methodology developed by Litro de Luz w as made to be replicated in different contexts and with communities of different nature and culture. Hybrid organizational structure. In 2018, a new organizational change took place in the organization. Litro de Luz hired their first staff member. The hire d team of five people consists of an intern , a commercial manager, the president and two vice presidents, one in charge of human resources an the other one in charge of operations and technology. The four other board members remain as volunteers and are responsible for the legal, financial, social development and marketing departments. The organization also counts with an advisory board with 7 members, including Vitor Belota, Litro de Luz’s founder. The decision to hir e part of the staff was an important step to support the organization growth. “We are still undertaking, so it is difficult this matter of retention and attraction of qualified people to make the Litro de Luz grow, because without good people, it is very difficult for you to grow.”", "Creation of new cells and expansion throughout the country. New cells are created, reaching out to a total of six spread across the five regions of Brazil, Florianópolis in the south, São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, in the southeast, Brasília, in the center -west, Manaus, in the north and Campina Grande in the northeast. The cells organize and manage local operations being responsible for the contact with the communities, diagno sis of the community lighting needs, training for the production and maintenance of the products, and installation of the solutions. Up to 2019, Litro de Luz organized actions in 121 communities across the country, as showed in Figure 1 0, including actions in remote communities, like the indigenous community of Morro dos Cavalos, located in the district of Palhoças in Santa Catarina, a quilombola community in the region of Cavalcante, Goiás, Amazonian riverside communities and villages in the northeastern “sertão”.

During the coronavirus pandemic in 2020, Litro de Luz had to stop its in loco activities in March , after carrying out two operations in Rio de Janeiro. However, i n this period, they started campaigns to raise hygiene products, food, and water for 2 9 partner communities. During their crowdfunding campaign, “Litro de Luz pelas Comunidades”, they raised over BRL30.000 that were used for the distribution of 313 basic food basket s and 800 food stamps to 1.113 families throughout Brazil using their local ambassador network.", "Communities 3 17 75 24 121 Ambassadors 1 50 69 66 186 In an effort to connect their lighting solutions with the communities during the pandemic, Li tro de Luz started an action called “ Monte Sua Luz”, with the creation of a manual for the construction of the portable solution, Lampião, available for free online. It also started online workshops that teach people to assemble the Lampião. The materials were delivered to people’s houses and the assembled products were collected by the cells after a few days. The online workshops were a way to collect donations, engage society and create portable solutions that will be later delivered to their partner comm unities.", "4.2.3 Vision for the Future", "Reaching remote communities . A recent analysis by IEMA (2019) estimates that around 1 million people have no access to electricity in Brazil. Most of them located in the Amazon region, as showed in Figure 1 1 Higashi highlighted the Amazon communities as their main focus going forward.", "“the difference is that now we do not necessarily need to get to other states, but rather reach more communities that do not have energy, that need more and that are often more isolated from the Amazon region. So, our focus is kind of in this region, to expand there.” Belota, currently part of the advisory board, also declares that the focus going forward should be in the small remote communities that are often overlooked by the public power and hardly ever are contemplated in public policies. “For me our focus is not to work in slums, our focus is to work in riverside communities, it is to work in quilombola communities, there for those 2%, 3%, which are not big enough for the p ublic power to look at, are not big enough for this to be a relevant social problem of public policy, but it is a population that is unassisted and that often no one is looking and that we", "... Someone has to look. ”", "Figure 11 - Territories with no access to electricity", "Source: IEMA website, November 2019.", "Permanent solutions. Higashi also identifies a second move for the future of Litro de Luz working with their network of communities to articulate with the government to ensure the population access to electricity and public lighting. “Our solution is a temporary solution, (…) and it's just light, it's not like you're electrifying a house, so you can turn on a refrigerator and stuff. So, we... These other benefits they are really the responsibility of the government and it makes a lot more sense for us to help them get that right, you know? So, we are leaving for a new moment when we bring light, but we will try, together with the community later, to bring the energy or bri ng the public lighting (…) has a much more long -term impact, that before we weren’t even considering .” Going beyond electricity . Another possibility for the organization is to expand their activities beyond solar light technologies and provide solutions i n other areas. Higashi declares that the organization has already been trying to validate other solutions and that its part of their plans in 2021.", "“We've been trying for a while to validate some other solution outside lighting, and in 2021 it's going to be a year to really put this more in check .” For Belota, Litro de Luz ’s next step will rely heavily on the technological development of the organization . He even highlighted that other chapters of the Liter of Light movement have already stablished hybrid models bringing not only light but also internet to the communities.", "“I feel that the future of Liter of Light, for me at least, is a very great improvement of our technology and the possibilities of this technology, what this technology does, so for me ma ybe it is no longer just take the specific lighting, but sometimes take internet, take ... Anyway, there are some models that are hybrids in this way, but how do we manage to take technology, especially lighting, always, but technology as a whole .”", "4.3 Projet o RUAS", "In March 2020, the estimated number of homeless people in Brazil was 221.869, from which more than half is located in the southeast region (Natalino, 2020).

The organization also works to increase awareness regarding the iss ue and articulate with other organizations to lobby for government action.", "4.3.1 Creation and Early Operation (2014 – 2017)", "Projeto RUAS an acronym for Ronda Urbana de Amigos Solidários, was founded by four friends, Alini Fernandes, Bruno Valente, Deborah Barrocas and Murilo Sabino . The idea to start the project came after Sabino joined a group of friends that went to the streets of downtown Rio de Janiro to distribute food for those who were starving. In an interview for the newspaper O Globo in 20 18, Sabino shared that RUAS started in the social media to collect donations for the distributions that were coordinated by a group of friends.", "“six months, twice a week. Like everything in life, when you do it with recurrence, you learn, you start to understand the social role, to perceive patterns... I saw the opportunity to do it in a more structured way. We took bread from the mangueira hill, mortadela from my friend's father's restaurant, bought juice, bar soap and made kits. I suggested to stop spending our money and incorporate more donations. We had to advertise what we were doing. For social media, we needed a name. RUAS (Ronda Urbana de A migos Solidários) emerged. We put the project on Instagram, people started to enjoy, likes were growing, and more than donations came people wanting to participate. We started to create a process to absorb these volunteers .” In September 2014, RUAS was born with an itinerant distribution of kits composed of food and hygiene products to the homeless population in the neighborhood s of the south zone of Rio de Janeiro .", "The start of a new operation, n etwork building and sharing knowledge . Early on they realized that, more than food, the homeless population longed for attention. From then on, they started transforming their project to promote the well -being and citizenship of the homeless population. During the first six months of RUAS, the team reach ed out to NGOs and other organizations that worked with the homeless population to develop best practices and processes to provide aid for their attendees. They continued to use social media, especially Instagram, to share stories, raise awareness and demystify the reality of the homeless population , as showed in Figure 1 2.

In October 2015, the project expanded to Botafogo with the creation of weekly meetings with fixed time and location. The goal was to create a space of connection between the homeless population and the residents of its surroundings, through activities that seek to strengthen the autonomy and self - esteem of this population. There was also the distribution of food, clothes, and personal hygiene products to address punctual needs, however the main objective of the project was to provide information and to stimulate and facilitate the choices of this populati on, improving their quality of life. During the meetings, a group of local volunteers interact ed with the attendees following a discussion methodology that encompass topics like self - esteem, autonomy, family ties, chemical dependence, and unemployment . The fixed model allow ed the team to have higher visibility and deepen the relationship between volunteers and attendees.", "Local expansion of Rondas. In December 2015, the original itinerant Ronda establishes a fixed location in Leblon. Just like the one in Bot afogo, the team was composed of residents of the area and had autonomy to build local partnerships and collect donations. In May 2017, a new Ronda is established in Copacabana, another neighborhood in the south zone of Rio de Janeiro following the same mod el and methodology of the previous ones. The geographical expansion of Rondas follows the incidence of both volunteers and homeless population as explained by Larissa Montel, manager of Projeto RUAS.", "“to select the neighborhood s, we followed the subway line and identified there where we already had incidence , both volunteering, and homeless population. So, we started in Leblon, from Leblon we went there to Botafogo, that we already had a great incidence of volunteering, of people willing to volunteer... Then we went to Copacabana, which had a large incidence of homeless people, and then Largo do Machado was a neighborhood that was much requested by volunteers already, and also that we perceived an incidence of homeless population. We thought... Because we have this model of scalability, so the idea would be to or keep following, and then... Catete, Gloria, Lapa, Centro... Or go to Tijuca, because Tijuca also had a high incidence, both of homeless people and of available volunteers” .", "The methodology of Rondas . Every Ronda is divided in three stages, the first is the meeting with the volunteers on site where they receive complementary orientation by the NGO, this moment helps to break stereotypes about homeless population and align the mission and values of the organization with all who will participat e in the activity. The second stage is the street attendance, when everyone arrives at a location previously combined and fixed, have a shared meal between volunteers and people in homelessness situation. This is a moment of individual contact, where the v olunteers make the registrations and follow -up of the services. The third stage is the discussion circle. This dynamic facilitated by volunteers or multidisciplinary professionals, conducting activities scheduled for the development and strengthening of au tonomy and self -esteem of the serviced, involving health, art, culture and technology. It is an open space for empathic listening and exchanging experiences. At the end of each round, there is a moment of group reflection, where feedback is captured from e ach participating volunteer and reports and updates are passed to all present. Successful activities from a specific Ronda are shared and replicated to others. In an interview for the magazine Veja in December 2016, Barrocas highlted how the Rondas also ai ded attendees in practical issues. \"We do circles of conversation on various subjects and take professionals , such as psychologists and sociologists, to give lectures (…) We help them get documents, we look for rehabilitation centers, jobs, and we even cal l someone when they ask.\" Formalization as an NGO. In January 2016 , through a partnership between Projeto RUAS, FGV and a law office, the first steps towards the creation of a statute and formalization of RUAS as an NGO are taken. In August 2016, RUAS be came a registered NGO and start ed developing the technological infrastructure necessary for its next growth stage.", "Developing new projects. Through demands identified during the Rondas, two other programs were developed by the NGO in the end of 2016, “ Jovens” and “Reintegra e Reforma”. The first one started as an adaptation of Rondas focused on children and teenagers that started participat ing in the Rondas activities, initially it was centered on the development of parallel and child -specific dynamics, later on the Jovens program began to gradually expand its performance encompassing areas like family reconnection, cultural integration and networking, the project support young people in their search for documentation, free teaching and psychological fol low-up by public services.. Like the Jovens program, Reintegra e Reforma (RR) emerged in RUAS based on demands that extrapolated the space and format of the Rondas. In 2016, a group of volunteers began to organize these demands, mainly focused on chemical dependency treatment and social reintegration, such as referral to therapeutic communities, job search and family connections. The goal of RR was to be a support system for the attendees who wishe d to get off the streets or treat their substance addiction. The NGO work ed as facilitators, showing existing public and private services and available options. The focus were the therapeutic communities, that have a very low success rate.", "Housing First, moving towards a long -lasting impact. In 2016, another pilot project was initiated by Projeto RUAS. Based on the international methodology called Housing First, the focus of the Habitação Primeiro program is to supply selected attendees with their basic needs in the form of individualized permanent housing, food, an d additional services. This approach builds on the fact that only by having their basic needs fulfilled, people are capable of addressing other issues related to employment, addiction or finances. This methodology has already been employed in the United St ates, Canada, Australia, Japan and Europe, becoming even a public policy.", "“Minha história conta” campaign. In 2017, RUAS produced 20 videos with the goal of fostering debates about the condition of the homeless population. Through video reports, complemented with data and research, and discussing topics such addiction, unemployment, family, education, migration, sexism, and mental health. The videos are one of the tools to present the reality of the homeless population and change the perception of the general public, raise awareness and seek partnerships and volunteers. Expansion to Maceió. In August 2017, the organization attempted its first expansion outside of Rio de Janeiro. The project started like the previous Rondas with a recruitment campaign for local volunteers in social networks , however, the project in Maceió suffered from mission drift and was cancelled after a year , as confirmed by Montel . “We stayed a year in Maceió, and it happened a lot, a real misunderstanding of the function that we were there to occupy . (…) RUAS started in a very organic way. And then we had a very decentralized format and open to new initiatives... And the volunteers were creating. They were creating, they were creating, and that generated some problems, because people sometimes acted according to their impulse (…) Much in the passion, thus, of making a change, but sometimes they put at risk, put the institu tion at risk, sometimes put even an attendee at risk.\"", "4.3.2 Strategic Planning and the development of a new structure to support growth Organizational structure. In 2018 the organization went through a restructuration. The new organizational structure , portrayed in Figure 1 3, counts with four departments, called cells . The four cells are: Operations, responsible for the local partnerships and the existing programs (Rondas, RR and Jovens); Relationship, in charge of communication, press, partnerships, training programs and IT; Support, responsible for legal, financial, and human resources; Projects, responsible for R&D, innovation, sustainability and expansion . The four cells are managed by three hired professionals working full -time and a volunteer administrative council composed of the four founders . The decision to build a fixed staff group of 3 in 2018 was a strategic decision for the expansion of RUAS and its impact, increasing fundrai sing, strengthening partnerships and increasing the visibility of the project (Annual Report, 2018). According to Montel that started in the organization as a volunteer in the middle of 2016 and became part of the hired staff, this movement represented a key strategic step towards RUAS’s growth. “investment in hiring, so, so having people dedicated full time to the organization makes a lot of difference, right? We were coming... The organization started as an initiative of friends, a project of friends, an d then we went professionalizing, and had these employees, people who study the theme, people who empower themselves, and can dedicate their time even in a more targeted way, I believe it made a lot of difference to our growth, made a lot of difference to our impact, for the impact that we generate today. ”", "Figure 13 - Organizational Structure Projeto RUAS", "Note. Adapted from Projeto RUAS 2019 Annual Report Funding. The organizatio n funds its operations through a combination of punctual and recurrent donations, from both individuals called virtual volunteers and companies , partnerships, that contribute with products and services, fundraising events and a crowdfunding campaign focused on the Housing First pilot op eration . Mondel highlights the contribution of the partnership model not only for funding but also to strengthen the engagement between the local community and the organization. “most of the partnerships that we have are partnerships by neighborhood, (…) usually are people who live in that neighborhood, she goes to get, \"ah, a soup partnership\", which sometimes she knows, like, uh, \"I do gym with the son of the guy who owns that business \", you know? And it is making these bonds that are strong networks li ke this, are partnerships that form and that create this network that operates. And we have some slightly more strategic partnerships, right? From the design part... We have our recurring crowdfunding campaign, which is a donation of individuals, we have a partnership, for example, with the Duo C arioc a, that organizes events (…) We have very nice partnerships with the private sector, and this thing of community engagement, not only for volunteering, but also for maintenance, for the financial sustainability of the organization.”", "Social Media and Media Exposure. Social media has been a key platform for RUAS expansion since its inception. Projeto RUAS uses the social media to engage volunteers, donors and raise awareness and visibility for the homeless population. Before expanding to a new area, they arrange an open call to attract residents of the neighborhood. By the end of 2020, RUAS had over 2 0 thousand followers on Instagram and 15 thousand on Facebook.", "“when we open a new neighborhood, we usually make a call with the residents of that neighborhood, that, look, we arrived, \"Tijuca, we arrived\", and then we do a training event, in which we try to get, already a first (…) We try to get a fixed team to start these jobs, right? So that... We have there a base team to assemble logistics, assemble the first contacts, the search for partnerships ... ”", "Developing a s trategic al plan. In 2019, the council of RUAS conducted the first strategic planning of the organization to define their objectives and activities for the next two years. According to the strategical map developed by the organization showed in Figure 1 4, the focus of the organization would be to increase and deepen their impact through territorial expansion and l everag ing initiatives with greater transformation potential, that build opportunities for the homeless population like housing first . Another key goal was focused on i ncreas ing society awareness and influence public policies using the knowledge and data collected from their operations. “We created a strategical plan, it helped a lot in the work, because we said, \"ok, this is where we want to get to\". So we start to walk a path to get here. We start making plans, steps, goals... Divide these goals by areas... We created areas within the RUAS, with the leaders, invested a lot in training, training on the organization, training on the cause, technical training... We invest a lot in training... We create routines, meeting routine, meeting routine, alignment routine... These processes all made a lot of difference for us to be able to continue generating social impact and be able to see this impact in a more concrete way.” Figure 14 - Projeto RUAS Strategical Map", "Source. 2019 Annual Report Structuring the volunteer program. After the strategic planning, a few changes were made in the volunteer program. First, the standardization of the volunteer capacitation with the creation of an online system for registration, a training video, and the creation of the code of conduct and a matrix of roles and responsibilities, the first guides the individual performance within the group and the second enables an understanding of the limits of action within the organization. The development of a structured and standardized model for voluntee ring i s part of the foundation needed to support their goal of increas ing geographic coverage and becoming a social franchise . For Montel, the structuring of the volunteer program is an important step to reduce the risk of mission drift while maintaining t he autonomous characteristic of the project. “we created a code of conduct, and the code of conduct is one of the materials that we always use in our training, even as a form... First of trying to work people's eyes, trying to work that is it, no, you are not going to save that person's life, you know? You do not have to take it and get the person off the street, anyway, we are not there to get anyone off the street, we're there to offer opportunity. So, work this look first, and then also for us to have a legal guarantee, that the person is taking responsibility for their acts, informed she was, empowered she was. If she wants to act out... And then having these materials helped a lot to decrease, so today people consult a lot more, before they have an act ion, before they do something like that kind of on impulse, they consult. I think that the creation of a network that we made also helps so that these impulsive actions are co ied, or are, thus, diminished in the process, in short. ”", "Structuring and standardizing the Rondas . To ensure that the Rondas become easily replicable, RUAS invested in a process of standardization of the dynamics, creating a process for local partnerships, investing in the capacitation and training of the facili tators of the Rondas and developing a system of registration and search for the activities performed, this database allows the replication of successful dynamics across different locations and with different groups. Montel highlights the importance of the standardize structure of the Ronda to allow the replication.", "“It uses a format, usually revolves around volunteer for it to be replicated. So, the Ronda , this format that we have of the Ronda , that this can only be replicated to other neighborhoods, to other cities, to other states ... If we hired one person for each round, it would be unsustainable, right? So we make a leaner format even, to enable this volunteering, and then we have these ne ighborhood centers in which people take over functions, take care of logistics ... Today we do not have to be in action, do we? On a round for it to happen. Because we provide training, materials, partnerships... And then the round goes on to rhythm. ”", "Network and lobbying. Since its inception, RUAS has partnered with other actors to achieve higher impact. In 2018, it d evelop ed “Mapa de Apoio ”, an online tool that facilitates the search for existing services related to the homeless population. In this tool available in RUAS website they map over 327 services divided into 10 categories: health, mental health, addiction, housing, education, lega l counseling, women aid, children aid, elderly and NGOs. Mapa de Apoio is an initiative to leverage on the network, connect solutions and attendees, increasing the network impact.", "In 2019, Projeto RUAS started the creation of a work group for case studies around Largo do Machado and the south zone of Rio de Janeiro, joining the Rio Criança Network, a national reference articulation in the work and defense of human rights of children and adolescents living in homelessness situation, set up in 2001 and composed of 11 social organizations. They also participate in integrated action groups, such as the “GT Pop Rua” with a focus on documentation and housing, the “Fórum Permanente sobre população adulta e m situação de rua do RJ”, a group of political articulation that has been operating for almost 20 years and NAEH created by the Brazilian Red Cross, with the objective of bringing together organizations that work with chemical dependence, mental and homele ss population, In these work groups they discuss experiences, projects and public policies.", "“We have a network, so today we are part of two groups, one is a state forum of adult populations in street situation, I am part of the coordination of this forum a s representative of RUAS . So, I have monthly meetings and we will debate public policies, we will debate what is being built for homeless people throughout the state of RJ, and this already leaves us connected with a network there, right? From other organizations. And we are part of a group called GT Pop Rua, which was created by the Public Defender's Office of the state, which brings together several NGOs, various initiatives, which work in populations in street situation... And then, again, pre -pandemic, right? We used to have m onthly meetings, also to debate... Thus, discuss the practices of each organization, present papers... We have a lot of dialogue with the powers... With public services... We work... It is part of some working groups of case studies, of common care, becaus e we have attende es that go through all these services, through all this equipment , and then we have some meetings of case study, profile monitoring. And then eventually we do actions in partnerships with other NGOs too .”", "PDI methodology. In 2019 , RR was restructure d to include a PDI (Individual Development Plan) , a methodology widely used in companies, and usually linked to a specific objective: a promotion, a personal achievement, a change in organization. The PDI creates an action plan focused on the personal goal, mapping strengths and obstacles. The purpose of the PDI i s to transform the attendee’s dreams in something attainable and concrete. The model also counts with a division of team tasks, strengthening the action in the rounds and training. With around 16 fixed volunteers, the new RR methodology was implemented in November 2019 with 7 pilot cases for follow - “we started to develop individual development plan, which we call PDI, which is a little to go beyond the space of the Ronda , but t rying to work these other needs that arise, from documentation, job search, family reconnection ... So we have the Active PDI, which has the context of housing too, but it was a gastronomy course, she wanted to go back to being a cook, and then we got this connection, for her to participate in the selection process, but for her to get the course, housing was a prerequisite, then we entered with the house, she started to do the gastronomy course, and we have been doing this follow -up”", "2020 and the coronavi rus pandemic. During the 2020 pandemic, Projeto RUAS replaced its traditional activities with 53 emergency actions starting in May, 50 of them in their traditional locations and 3 in a new neighborhood of Rio de Janeiro, Tijuca. In the emergency actions, a total of 36 volunteers and 31 partner institut ions distributed masks, meals, water, hygiene kits and blankets to 2.680 attendees. Some actions also had legal and medical consultations, haircuts, and baths. Alongside the emergency actions, Projeto RUAS started a national online movement, called #POPRUA EUMEIMPORTO. The movement counted with instructions regarding the creation of donation stations, hygiene and food kits and an infographic to inform people in homelessness situation of the risks and symptoms of coronavirus and sharing protective measures. T he guide also included a protocol for the volunteers regarding their behavior and sanitary protective measures. The NGO also developed a map with multiple donation stations registered by volunteers, so that other participants could contribute, by the end o f 2020, there were 84 registered donation stations spread across 7 states of Brazil.", "4.3.3 Vision for the future", "Technology for replication. One of the main future projects for RUAS is the replication of the model through a social franchising strategy. Montel states that the first action for RUAS will be to reinvest in the scalability of the program. To achieve a replicable model, she believes that the organization must invest in materials and technologies to “we want to automate this process to the fullest so that it continues to work well ... So, for example, we have a volunteer scheduling system, we have a system where these materials could be available, videos, reading materials... For us to try... Because I thi nk it is difficulty (…) to keep the essence. So, so, a great difficulty that we have to be able to climb is how we scale with quality, maintaining the essence of what we are here to do, because it is very easy, so in the performance with the population in street situation we end up resorting to what we usually see, resources, then falling into a very assistance place (…) how do you create tools for this essence to be maintained, even if we are not in these spaces, right? And then the technology comes in, we think a lot about using technology, as a platform, as a type of system, that can provide the resources so that this essence is maintained (...) we think a lot about the resumption of the Rondas post- vaccine, so we want to reinvest in this scalability, to b e able to have rounds in other neighborhoods, and today the work that thinks about doing it, how we create these materials, creates these technologies, so that the round can be replicable, maintaining this essence, then work this challenge, so that in a po st-pandemic scenario we can start climbing in a much broader way so , then start creating 10 rounds, 15 rounds, anyway... This is one of the paths that we see as possible...”", "Working with the government. In the process to achieve deeper impact , RUAS identif ied Housing First as one of the initiatives with largest transformation potential and the importance of partnership with the government and pressure por public policies regarding the right to housing .", "“To deepen this issue of housing also, so we t ry to make a more robust housing project, housing first, with more cases of study... We maintain our political incidence, our performance in the forums, in these spaces too, to follow what has been done, and see RUAS as a reference space as well. I think that in the debate about the homeless population, in this education about the homeless population, in this breaking of stereotypes, in the generation of data, maybe, too, it is a path that we see as possible... You know, from research.”", "5 DISCUSSION AND CROSS -CASE SYNTHESIS", "In this section we will discuss the trajectory of the two organizations through the propositions and dimensions identified previously in chapter 2. We will use the dimensions of analysis to try to answer the following questions for both case studies.  What are the possible scaling strategies of social initiatives?  What are the drivers of the scaling process?", " What are the factors that can limit or prevent social initiatives to scale?  What are the external and internal factors that influence or determine the strategy selection?", "5.1 Scaling Impact", "As discussed in section 2.1, scaling impact encompass both quantitative and qualitative expansion. Scaling is not only growth in terms of size, geographic expa nsion, or number of people but also in terms of the number of spin -offs created, and the number of projects that have been created or taken over by other actors (Uvin, Jain & Brown, 2000; Desa and Koch, 2014; Bradach, 2010) .", "Quantitative scaling focus on expanding geographically or in number of beneficiaries and can happen from the expansion of the organization own operation or from the action of a network motivated by the action of the organization (Uvin, Jain & Qualitative scaling , on the other hand, focus on the creation of spin -off activities of products to deepen the impact of the solution for the target audience focusing on not simply serving more individuals or areas, but about improving the service offered to the existing audience (D ees et al. , 2004).", "Table 6 - Classification of Scaling Initiatives", "Source. Author (2021) For Litro de Luz, the creation of new cells and the expansion of their operations to new communities across the country are a form of quantitative scaling through operational growth. The same with the creation of new Rondas by Projeto RUAS, in both cases increasing the operation and the operation area led to an increase in number of people impacted by their activities. However, for those quantitative scaling initiatives to be successful, both organizations had to development multiple internal capabilities, structure the organization’s processes and increase the number of funds and staff. Through open -source projects like th e ones both organizations carried out during the coronavirus pandemic, they were able to increase their impact by motivating and engaging others into replicating their activities without needing to expand their own operation. These scaling initiatives focu sed on ecosystem growth gained more relevance during the year of 2020 due to the local restrictions of the pandemic that limited the NGOs activities , however it also reduced their control over their developed solution and the potential applications , since people were free to use and adapt their open -source solutions .", "With the development of new solutions that would have a larger and long -lasting impact into people’s lives, like the nighttime technology, the lampposts and the lampiões, Litro de Luz experienced also qualitative scaling . The same can be observed with RUAS with the creation of specialized programs focusing on solving deeper issues, like Litro de Luz Projeto RUAS Qualitative scaling Quantitative scaling:", "ecosystem Quantitative scaling:", "operational Jovens, RR, Housing First", "#POPRUAEUME IMPORTO New RondasLampposts, Lampiões Monte sua Luz New cells, new communities and regions substance abuse, unemployment, and housing. In these cases, as Desa and Koch’s (2014) work describes, there was a growth in the depth of impact. Considering the first theoretical proposition, that argues that t he category of scaling impact can determine or be limited by the process of scaling impact , and the experience of both organizations, we can obtain a few insights. First, quantitative scaling achieved through organizational growth requires a considerable amount of organization resources. Litro de Luz expansion was only possible due to an increa se in financial and human resources. In order to expand through the country and get to perform activities with the riverside communities in Amazon, they needed a team of trained volunteers, local leaders, funds, and a network of partner institutions. The s ame can be observed with the creation of new Rondas by RUAS, before expanding to a new region the organization dedicates its efforts to build a local engaged volunteer team and to establish partnerships with local businesses to donate material or sponsor t he activity. For quantitative scaling through ecosystem growth, like the ones both organizations lead during the pandemic, the main resources were related to communication and network. For both organizations it was an opportunity to increase their impact w ithout logistical restrictions and using a minimum amount of organizational resources. However, measuring impact from ecosystem growth and understanding the growth potential from this type of projects presents a large challenge .", "Qualitative scaling is mor e resource intensive than ecosystem growth, especially in terms of financial resources. A key aspect for qualitative growth is the demand of intellectual resources as it requires a deep knowledge of the existing activities and the target audience along wit h the development of incremental solutions to address the challenges and the development of new skills, resources and knowledge to implement the solution . In the case of Litro de Luz, technical expertise was necessary for the development of the new solutio ns, for the lampposts, the existing network and the new partnerships made were necessary to deal with both the technical and financial needs of the development stage , while the development of the portable solutions required also a deep understanding of the needs and the reality of the communities . For RUAS, the spin - offs r equired intellectual, human, and financial resources. For instance, Jovens and RR The combination of the theoretical insights and the case studies trough the identification of the variables presented in the framework in multiple steps of the scaling process contribute s both to the area of scaling social impact and the Brazilian social innovation ecosystem that is centered in NGOs. The current study can be used to develop further the literature regarding the process of scaling social impact. In the following section, a few research opportunities are identified.", "6.1 Limitations and Research Opportunities", "This research does not encompass all the factors involved in both the decision making, and operational steps of the scaling process, it focuses only on the most relevant factors identified in the reviewed literature. Among the dimensions identified would b e interesting to investigate the relationship between dimensions, understanding the contribution of each dimension to the scaling process and what combinations have higher impact in limiting or driving the scaling process. A quantitative research with a la rge number of organizations can bring interesting insights to understand the relevance and correlation between variables.", "The selected case studies are all from ventures that have successfully scaled, includ ing ventures that started a scaling process and failed to grow could provide interesting insights. The scope of this research does not involve the definition or validation of any measurement of impact, using the number of beneficiaries, locations, and service offerings as proxies for impact.", "Further exploration of the framework into different social -economical and geographical contexts could be used to better understand the environmental and political differences, focusing on specific areas, organizations with similar offerings, target audienc e or service, to understand the particularities of each area, while combining both and comparing different areas or social economical contexts will lead to develop more generalizable theories. Another opportunity is to include impact measurement methodolog ies. Even though the discussion on impact measurement is a critical topic in the social innovation literature and some proxies for impact measurement were used throughout the work, the methodologies of impact measurement were out of the scope of this resea rch, and consequently their validity were not discussed. Besides the limitation of the scope of the research, the methods selected present their own limitations . The key words and the data base selection used in the literature review, despite leading to a collection of relevant material limited the results and might have excluded other relevant documents. Therefore, further research using other data bases and expanding the selection of keywords could bring interesting insights for the area. The case study m ethod also lacks a statistically relevant sample size providing little basis for generalization of results to a wider population , a bigger sample would enhance the reliability of the research . Another limitation are t he potential biases present in the collection of primary data, from both the researcher and the interviewee. A list of key questions derived from the gaps of this research are organized in Table 7. Table 7 - Future Research Opportunity", "Source.

Also, the mediating influence of the perception of congruence between the sponsor and eSports on the relation between the spectator’s identification with eSports and the sponsor ’s brand eq uity is investigated. The st udy contributes to the previous literature in sponsorship and eSports, using as main theoretical reference the Social Identity Theory (Tajfel et al., 1979) , the Associative Network Theory (Collins & Loftus, 1975) and the Schema Theory (Axelr od, 1973) . The research questions originated three substantive hypotheses that were investigated to verify the relation between the spectator’s identification with eSports, the perception of brand equity (Oi or Dell), the purchase intention towards the sponsor’s products or services, and the perception of congruence between the sponsor and Sports. The study was conducted during two eSports events held in the city of Rio de Janeiro in 2019: Game XP and CBLoL . A survey was applied at the events’ entrance t o spectators that attended the event with t he intention to watch eSports. During Game XP 446 valid questionnaires were coll ected and 232 during CBLo L. The data analysis for the samples for each event was made separately using EFA and CFA, having the reliability and the convergent and discriminant validities of the constructs being verified. To test the substantive hypotheses, the Structural Equations Modeling was used, together with the ML technique. Also, the four steps technique proposed by Baron an d Kenny (1986) , the Sobel Test (1982) and the bootstrapping analysis were conducted to su pport the mediating effect of the congruence perc eption . The empirical results suggest that the spectator regarding the sponsor’s brand equity influences his/hers own purchase intention towards the sponsor’s products or services. Besides that, the hypotheses regarding the mediating influence of the perce ption of congruence between the spectator’s identification with eSports and the sponsor’s brand equity was supported, being this effect partial for one event and total for the other. We can speculate that this difference is related to the spectator’s perc eption over the sponsor being endemic or not.", "Keywords: eSports, Sponsorship, Events, Identification, Br and Equity , Purchase Intention .", "LIST OF ILLUSTRA TIONS FIGUR ES", "LIST OF TABLES", "Table 25 - Original Overall Brand Equity Scale, from Yoo and Donthu (2001) .................. 117 Table 26 - Original Sponsor -Event Fit Scale, from Speed and Thompson (2000) ............... 117", "LIST OF ABBREVIATIONS", "ADF Asymptotically Distribution -Free ADSL Assymetrical Digital Subscriber Line AVE Average Variance Extracted CBLoL Brazilian League of Legends Championship CBBE Consumer Based Brand Equity CFA Confirmatory Factor Analysis CFI Comparative Fit Index CR Construct Reliability DotA Defense of the Ancients EFA Exploratory Factor Analysis F1 Formula 1 FBBE Firm Based Brand Equity FGV Fundação Getúlio Vargas FIFA Fédération Internationale de Football Association FPS First-Person Shooting GFI Goodness of Fit Index ICTs Information and Communication Technlogies IOC International Olympic Committee KMO Kaiser -Meyer -Olkin LoL League of Legends ML Maximum Likelihood MOBA Multiplayer Online Battle Arena MSA Measuring of Sampling Adequacy MSSC Motivation Scale for Sport Consumption NASCAR National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing OBE Overall Brand Equity PGA Professional Golfers' Association PUBG PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds PUC Pontifical Catholic University RMSEA Root Mean Square Error of Approximation RTS Real Time Strategy SEM Structural Equation Modeling SESD Scale for eSports Spectator Demand SII Sport Interest Inventory SIT Social Identity Theory Uerj University of the State of Rio de Janeiro UFRJ Federal University of Rio de Janeiro", "CONTENTS", "3.2.2 The influence of the sponsor’s brand equity in the eSports spectator’s purchase intention", "3.2.3 The influence of congruence in the relationship between the identification with eSports and the", "4.3.3 Variables relative to the spectator’s perception of congruence between eSports and the sponsor", "4.3.4 Variables relative to the spectator’s purchase intention towards the sponsor’s products or", "services 54", "6.2.1 Question 1: Does the spectators’ identification with eSports influences the sponsor’s brand", "equity? 97", "6.2.2 Question 2: Does the sponsor’s brand equity influences the spectator’s purchase intention", "6.2.3 Question 3: Does the spectators’ perception of congruence between eSports and the sponsor’s", "brand has a mediating effect in the relation between t he spectators’ identification with eSports and the Appendix 1 - Consumer Decision Process Model from Kotler and Keller (2015) ......... 114", "1 INTRODUCTION", "1.1 Study Objectives", "This study´s main objective is to contribute to the previous literature on eSports events sponsorship , by investigating the influence of the spectator identification with eSports in the sponsor’s brand equity and the spectator purchase intention towards the sponsor’s products. Also, the perceived congruence between eSports and the sponsor is also investig ated and how it mediates the relation between the identification with eSports and sponsor’s brand equity. Those relations were already studied and verified in the sports marketing literature, but little, if any, research have focused on verifying them in a n eSports context. T his study intends to contribute with evidence to support those relations, by investigating them in Game XP, a recently created event (the first edition was in 2017), held in Rio de Janeiro, with a gaming thematic and a wide variety of a ttractions, and the Brazilian League of Legends Championship Finals (CBLoL).", "1.2 Origin and importance of the study", "The importance of events as motivator of tourism is unquestionable and many researchers have studied events using a destinations and tourism ind ustry perspective (Getz, 2008) . Crompton and Mckay (1997) even reported that suggestions were being made, at that time, towards the recognition of festivals as one of the three major categories of tourism attractions, along with ambient attractions and permanent attractions. Due to this importance, in the late 1980s, the term ‘event tourism’ had what supposedly w as its first appearances in articles (Getz, 1989) and tourism reports. After that, event studies experienced an incredible growth and today ‘event tourism’ is generally recognized as being inclusive of all planned events (Getz, 2008) . Other fast growing fields in the last decades are gaming and eSports. In recent years, eSport have been growing at an incredibly fast pace, both in spectatorship and in revenue . For instance, in 2018 the audience of eSports reached 395 million people, among enthusiasts and occasional viewers, and is expected to reach 454 million in 2019 and 645 million by 2022 (Newzoo, 2019a) . Also, the money flowing in the industry is growing", "considerably, with the total revenues in 2018 reaching 865 million dollars and is expected to reach 1 billion in 2019 and almost 1.8 billion by 2022 (Newzoo, 2019b) . As eSports grow , more opportunities to explore new potential revenue streams emerge. Among these new opportunities we can find eSports and gaming events, such as Fortnite World Cup and League of Legends World Championship. However, the majority of the events is related t o one specific game and is focused on spectatorship. In an attempt to explore this big gaming industry and the growth eSports had been experiencing, Game XP was created in 2017, in Brazil, which is a different concept of event that has eSports and gaming as their main topic. The Game XP is a gaming themed event that calls itself a Game Park and describe s itself as ‘a place where the magic of amusement parks and the adventure of games coexist’1. The event started inside the Rock in Rio festival, one of the biggest music festivals in the world (inside the 2017 edition) and, in September 2018 had its first independent edition. Game XP was born from a partnership between Rock in Rio, Comic Con Experience (CCXP) and Grupo Globo (the biggest media company in Braz il).", "The event holds rollercoaster, ferris wheel, live shows, immersive experiences, video games, presence of the biggest game producing companies in the world and 3 arenas where people can watch important eSports competitive tournaments. In the 2018 editi on, the event had the biggest gaming screen in the world at the time, with 1,500 m² and received around 95,000 people and according to studies conducted by FGV (private Brazilian university) and presented by the Ministry of Culture, the economic impact of the event was of R$ 53.9 million. The Game XP 2019 (July 25th to 28th) is a big opportunity to study event sponsorship in the eSports context. In the 2019 edition, the main sponsor of the event (also called ‘master sponsor’) is a Brazilian telecommunicatio n company called Oi, which is also the sponsor of the eSports arena located inside the event, called Oi Game Arena, and will be used in this study to investigate the sponsorship in the eSports context.", "Data was also collected for this study during the CBLo L Finals, with a different sponsor: Dell. In comparison, CBLoL Finals are expected to attract much less attendance, since it is a one day eSports event, while Game XP is a four day festival that also holds", "1 Taken from Game XP of ficial website ( https://www.gamexp.com.br/a -gamexp ) on August 13th,", "eSports competitions, but with much more options f or the public, even with amusement park elements. Therefore, despite receiving much less people, 100% of the public of CBLoL Finals is there to watch eSports.", "1.3 Academic Relevance", "Getz (2008) mentions the spatial -temporal nature of planned events as a phenomenon, which leads to an important characteristic of them: the uniqueness of each individual event, explained by the unique interactions among the setting, people and management system. Therefore, studies held in different events can contribute with new evidence to previous findings.", "Sponsorship has been widely studied in the academic literature in different contexts, mainly since the 1990s. However, due to t he recency of eSports growth in comparison to other contexts in which sponsorship is well established (such as sports events), there is still little studies in sponsorship focused on an eSports context , if compared to other contexts in which sponsorship is present .", "This study intends to contribute with previous literature on eSports sponsorship by studying eSports’ spectators in the Game XP event and the Brazilian League of Legends Championship Finals (CBLoL) and investigating relations that were already studied in the sports marketing context, but in a different context: eSports events. Therefore, the theoretical contribution that this study intends to deliver is to provide additional evidence to aid w ith the understanding of sponsorship in the eSports context, which is recent, if compared to traditional sports, and has been growing fast. Specifically, this study intends to verify if and to what extent the event spectator identification with eSports inf luences the spectator’s perception of the sponsor’s brand equity, if and to what extent the spectator’s perception of the sponsor’s brand equity influences his own purchase intention towards sponsor’s products, and if and to what extent the spectator’s per ception of congruence between esports and the sponsor has mediating effect in the relationship between spectator’s identification with eSports and the perception of sponsor’s brand equity.", "1.4 Managerial Relevance", "Sponsorship in eSports have been growing very fast. According to IEG eSports sector update (2018) , more than 300 companies have invested in eS ports related sponsorship in 2018, being those companies from many different categories, from consumer electronics to non -alcoholic beverage and lottery & gaming. Those companies probably pursue different managerial objectives with their eSports sponsorshi ps. They might want to raise their brand awareness and brand equity or even connect with a specific target audience, eSports spectators. Other possibility is that companies want to sell more products to people identified with eSports. Therefore, the existe nce of evidence to support that those companies can really get closer to their objectives by sponsoring eSports can help marketing professionals to justify sponsorship decisions.", "Sponsorship investments can be high and is important that people responsible for making the sponsorship decision gather as much information as possible about a sponsorship opportunity. eSports is a fast growing market with great opportunities for companies but understanding how sponsorship works in this context is important for preventing them to invest great amounts of money in something that might not provide them the return they expect. Also, understanding eSports audience might help the companies to plan and execute brand activations that might please this target, therefore optimizing the sponsorship returns.", "In summary, any information that might enhance the companies’ understanding of sponsorship in the eSports context is extremely valuable to contribute to this discussion about sponsoring eSports, since a poorly planned or exe cuted sponsorship relation can be extremely harmful for the company. Finally, for the eSports industry, it is fundamental that sponsorship grows together with the audience, in order to provide financial support to keep the industry growth sustainable.", "2 THEORETICAL BACKGROUND", "2.1 eSports", "2.1.1 A brief history of eSports", "The beginning of competitive video gaming dates from the early 1980s, during the era of arcades. It is estimated that in 1981 and 1982, arcades earned around $5 billion annually (Borowy & Jin, 2013; Sheff & Eddy, 1999) . With the spread of the arcade, a unified gamer culture was establishe d, fostered by the advertisement of public games spaces, such as the arcades, as places for the new gaming community to get together to share their interests and consolidate the sense of group among them. The emergence of public gaming competitions in the arcades was fundamental for the establishment of the first “cyberathletes”, which used to compete among themselves looking for prizes and pride. Already at that time, professional arcade gamers used to compete with sponsorship, attract press coverage and b ecome famous, even though in a much smaller scale. These competitions were the early manifestations of sportification in the video game industry.", "The first tournaments held in arcades resemble in many aspects the eSports tournaments of nowadays. At that ti me, competitive gamers would get together in arcades to compete for the highest scores in games such as Pac -Man, Centipede, Donkey Kong and Galaga. However, despite the great influence of the arcade in the expansion of electronic games and the emergence of manifestations of sportification in the industry, the competitions were still between individual players. It was with the popularization of the personal computers and of the internet that the players starting to organize themselves in what was called “cla ns”, or teams of online players that competed together in online tournaments.", "The development of the gaming culture occurred very differently in Asia, in comparison from the United States and Europe, and, therefore, we can observe two distinct trajectories in gaming culture history, based on western and eastern value systems (Wagner, 2006) . In the 1990s, while competitive gaming was strongly connected to networked first -person shooting (FPS) games (Doom, Quake, Counter -Striker) in the western gaming culture, the eastern competitive gaming culture started in Korea and was", "strongly related to Massive Multiplayer Online Role -Playing Games (MMORPG) games (Lineage) and Real Time Strategy (RTS) game s (Starcraft). Independently if in the east or west of the planet, the emergence of online gaming moved the dynamic of the gaming community from being built upon the events in the arcades to being precipitated from the online to the offline (Huhh, 2008) .", "Due to the huge success of eSports in Korea in the 1990s, the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism approved the foundation of the Korea e -Sports Association to help develop the eSports in the country. Today, the Korean association is a role -model to other associations that have been founded in different countries, such as China, Japan, UK, Germany and Netherlands (Thib org, 2009) .", "After 2009, with the launch of League of Legends (LoL), the eSports scenario started to grow at a faster pace towards the numbers we have today in audience, revenues and prizes. Since that period, a new genre of eSports had grown incredibly: Multiplayer Online Battle Arena (MOBA), driven mainly by LoL and its main competitor Defense of the Ancients 2 (Dota 2). Even more recently, another genre reached the mainstream and exponential growth: Battle Royale, pushed by Fortnite, PlayerUnknown’s Ba ttlegrounds (PUBG), and others.", "The money flowing in the industry is growing at a quick pace. In 2018, eSports generated a total of 865 million dollars in revenues (considering merchandise & tickets, game publisher fees and brand investment revenues, which account for media rights, advertising and sponsorship), an increase in 32% from the previous year (Newzoo, million online viewers (Qian, Zhang, Wang, & Hulland, 2019) . It is estimated that in 2022 eSports will generate a revenue of around 1.8 billion dollars and achieve an audience of around 645 million people, among eSports enthusiasts and occasional viewers (Newzoo, 2019a) . This big numbers have attracted the attention of big brands all ov er the world, such as Coca -Cola, Intel, Mercedes Benz, American Express and others (Newzoo, 2017) . This dynamic scenario is one particularity of eSports, since it evolves very quickly with younger generations and the development of new technologies. This dynamism poses a constant question to which the biggest games producers seek to answer: w hat is the next big success in the industry?", "2.1.2 Defining eSports", "The term eSports have only recently been widely adopted to define competitive gaming. However, despite this acceptance of the title, eSports still lack a concrete, unified definition. A widely accepted definition would be fundamental not only to understand eSports itself, but also to orientate the discussion that came along with the adoption of the term: can eSports be compared to, or even considered as, traditional sports? Is this relation betw een them even necessary?", "Perhaps the first explicit definition of eSports was elaborated by Wagner (2006) , heavily inspired by the definition of traditional sports provided earlier b y Tiedemann (2015) . Wagner (2006) defined eSports as “an area of sport activities in which people develop and train mental or physical abilities in the use of information and communication technologies”. Wagner states that society should expect that the boundaries to what can be accepted as sport disciplines are dynamic, and that they will change as society’s value system changes, due to innumerable factors, such as technology progress. Wagner’s work is widely recognized as importa nt, being a relevant first step to the critical discussion about eSport. However, this definition raised some critics. Some authors argue that Wagner’s definition is too narrow, since it neglects the influence of various nonhuman factors (Hamari & Sjöblom, 2017; Witkowski, 2012) . Witkowski (2012) also questions the choice of the term “information and communication technologies” (ICTs), arguing that it places the computer as the dominant technology, which is, again, too narrow. Also, Hamari and Sjöblom (2017) argue that the definition proposed by Wagner is not enough to solve the question regarding the sporting activities that can be embraced by the traditional sports definition.", "Both Witkowski (2012) and Hamari and Sjöblom (2017) emphasize that is very important to bear in mind that the title eSports carries an important aspect of the game: the electronic. Based on this argument, Hamari and Sjöblom (2017) propose a new perspective in this quest to elaborate a solid definition for the term eSports, arguing that to properly define eSports, the focus shou ld be moved to the electronic factor in eSports. They propose that the main difference between eSports and traditional sports is related to the location in which the activities which determine the outcome of the sport are manifested. In traditional sports, these activities are seen in the “physical world” or “real world”, even if electronic systems are used to aid the sporting activity, while in eSports", "these activities happen in the “virtual world”, or within electronic -mediated environment. Based on their perspective, Hamari and Sjöblom (2017) proposed a new definition for eSports: “a form of sports where the primary aspects of the sport are facilitated by electronic systems; the input of players and teams as well as the output of the eSports system are mediated by human -computer interfaces”.", "Usually, eSports are divided in different genres. The genres put together games that have similarities in their structure. However, also the genres are not totally unified. For exampl e, in Qian et al (2019) , Battle Royale games are included in the First -Person Shooter genre, since they have si milarities between them. Some of the genres are:  Battle Royale: Fortnite, PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds (PUBG), etc.  Multiplayer Online Battle Arena (or MOBA): League of Legends, Dota 2,  First-Person Shooter (or FPS): Counter -Strike: Global Offensive , Quake,  Real Time Strategy (or RTS): Starcraft 2, Warcraft III, etc.  Fighting Games: Street Fighter V, Super Smash Bros, Tekken 7, etc.  Collectible Card Game: Heartstone, Yu -Gi-Oh!, etc.", " Sports Games: FIFA, NFL Madden, NBA 2k, etc.", "Also, differently from many of the traditional sports, eSport s are usually developed and owned by a company. This ownership model is different from the institutionalization process of the majority of the traditional sports, involving federations, confederations, and other b odies, and might have different impacts in the future of the field. Therefore, even those who criticize eSports and its comparison to traditional sports have reasons to understand the phenomenon and try to understand its consequences. Heere (2018) went back in time by bringing McBride (1975) to the discussion, when he s tates that: “Philosophers ought not waste their time attempting to define ‘sport’”. His conclusion is based on an understanding that sport is an ambiguous construct and the outcome of this understanding is that any attempt to present an absolute definition for sport would probably fail. Therefore, from this perspective, if sport is an undefinable construct, the debate of whether eSports are a form of sport loses completely its sense. However, after McBride’s statement, the sport industry has grown incredibl y. To serve", "this growing industry the discipline of sports management emerged, and with this new discipline’s rise, deciding if something qualified as a sport moved from being only an intellectual exercise to being also fundamental for the legislation of s port as a business activity and to help separate sports management from its parent discipline of management itself (Heere, 2018) . From this perspective, the discussion about eSports is just the most recent addition to a long discussion of what defines the sports management field. This broader discussion divides sports management scholars in two groups: the first group understand sports management as an interdisciplinary field and support an open view of what sports management is (Chalip, 2006) , while the second group argues that defining the boundaries of sports management is fundamental to differ entiate it from other fields, such as recreation management (Dustin & Schwab, 2008) .", "Some scholars support the idea tha t eSports are a manifestation of sportification in the video game industry (Heere, 2018) . Crum (1991) introduced the term sportification to the sports management field and Heere (2018) proposed two definitions to it: “(a) view, organize or regulate a non -sport activity in such a way that it resembles a sport and allows a fair, pleasurable, and safe environment for individuals to compete and cooperate, and compare their performances to each other, and future and past performances; or (b) add a sport component to an existing activity in order to make it more attractive to its audiences.” The sport construct is polymorphic by its nature (Heere, 2018) . Therefore, the definition of sport is totally dependent on its purpose and context. Heere provides the example of governmental entities concerned with the health of the population. In his example, for the purpose supported by those entities, sport should be understood as an instrument to increase people’s health, and the boundaries to the concept should be drawn upon this objective, excluding low intensity traditi onal sports from its definition. In summary, the acceptance of this polymorphic nature allows that each organization create its own definition to the construct, according to its own objectives (Heere, 2018) . In summary, the definition of eSports (and also sports in general) has been widely discussed in the literature, but no widely accepted definition was elaborated yet. Some scholars support that to keep sports management relevant, the perception of what sport is should evolve with time and embrace new manifestations of sportificatio n (Heere, 2018) . Fact is that eSp orts have been growing fast during the last years and it would be more", "interesting if scholars started to focus on studying the phenomenon eSports and its context through different perspectives, instead of wasting time and energy trying to make it fit into a polymorphic traditional sports definition. It would be important that even the people who criticize eSports invested their time in studying the phenomenon to help society to understand the potential negative effects of the phenomenon on obesity, social inclusion, gender equality and other aspects (Heere, 2018) .", "2.1.3 eSports Spectator Motives", "Spectators’ motives have been an interesting research topic both in traditional sports and eSports. Understanding what motivate people to watch a competition can help to enhance the potential of that com petition to attract audience and, consequently, revenue. In theory, the more people watching a competition, the more the organizers can charge from sponsors and broadcasters, bigger is the potential market for merchandising and tickets and bigger are the s ponsorships for the athletes, for example. Motivation is one of the most studied constructs in the sports field. Hebb (1955) proposes the first widely used definition for motivation as the process that energize and direct purposeful behavior , and Deci (1971) added that motives encourage behavior due to the enjoyment generated by the activities. Previous research shows that understanding motives helps to understand behavior (Trail & Kyoum Kim, 2011) and Trail, Fink and Anderson (2003) identified that mo tives are also central predictors of sport consumption decisions. Individuals attend to sport events for different reasons and focused on different aspects of the experience (Funk, Pizzo, & Baker, 2018; Trail, Robinson, Dick, & Gillentine, 2003) but most of the spectators behavior have been focused on fu lfilling social or psychological needs (Robinson, Trail, Dick, & Gillentine, 2005) . The first eSports stu dies related to motivation were focused on motivation to play eSports rather than spectatorship. Previous research suggests that playing eSports is motivated by competition, challenge, escapism and skill development (D. Lee & Schoenstedt, 2011; Weiss & Schiele, 2013) . More recently, scholars have started to give more attention to the motives for spectating eSports (Funk et al., 2018; Hamari & Sjöblom, 2017; Qian et al., 2019) . However, so far there is no study that has treated the different games and genres separately, treating motives to spectate eSports as universal", "According to Qian et al (2019) , it is fundamental to understand the theoretical sustenance o f eSports online spectator demand and also discuss the differences and similarities between eSports and traditional sports concerning spectators’ motives. Qian et al (2019) states that eSports online spectator demand originated from the same roots of what is known in the literature as sport market demand, which is a construct related to attitudes people have in consequence of their own evaluation and expectations toward the main attributes of core products. In the case of sports, the core product is sport games itself (Zhang, Lam, & Connaughton, 2003) . The sport market demand concept is based upon cognitive -oriented attitudinal theories such as theory of reasoned action and theory of planned behavior (Ajzen, 1991; Fishbein & Ajzen, 1975; Mazis, Ahtola, & Klippel, Based on the similarities between eSports and traditional sports, the first studies about the eSports market demand used the dimensions already established in previ ous study to understand the factors of market demand. Therefore, factors such as player characteristics (Byon, Zhang, & Connaughton, 2010; Zhang et al., 2003) , event attractiveness (Cianfrone, Zhang, Pitts, & Byon, 2015) , commentary features (Comisky, Bryant, & Zillmann, 1977) and schedule convenience (Braunstein, Zhang, Trail, & Gibson, 2005; Zhang et al., 2003) , that emerged as market demand factors related to traditional sports, were considered the core at tributes of eSports competitions and started to contribute to defining the dimensions of eSports online spectator demand (Qian et al., However, despite the similarities between eSports and traditional sports, there are still different aspects between them. Therefore, scholars have proposed that there might be other dimensions to measure eSports online spectator demand that go beyond the ones that were brought from traditional sports (Funk et al., 2018; Hamari & Sjöblom , 2017; Qian et al., 2019) .", "Literature has brought some aspects that are unique to eSports which could help to come up with possible dimensions to enhance the eSports online spectator demand measures. For example, eSports are extremely related to technology and, differently from traditional sports, the matches and tournaments are not necessarily the main attractions. Individual streamers, who bro adcast their gaming routine in addition to stream of major events, might be almost as important as the tournaments itself. The experience provided", "by streamers differentiate themselves from the regular events broadcasts as the former is able to develop its own personal identity whilst having the possibility of building communities through engagement with viewers, other players and other streamers, creating a network around his identity (Hamilton, Garretson, & Kerne, 2014) strengthened by a sense of belonging raised by the group to its memb ers, supported by the Social Identity Theory (Tajfel et al., 1979) .", "This engagement is fostered by other unique factor of eSports, which is the chat room. The chat room is a main fea ture in the eSports online spectating experience, allowing the spectators to interact among them and with the streamer via text - or image - based inputs, fortifying the network (Hamilton et al., 2014) . The communities associated with individual streamers and eSports events have changed the way online specta tors interact, adding a strong sense of connectedness to an experience that has previously been considered socially isolated: watching people playing video games (Bowles, 2018) . Therefore, this highly engaging and interactive environment are indicators that unique demand factors related to eSports sho uld be considered in addition to the ones that were taken from sports market demand. Qian et al. (2019) explored these new dimensions of online spectator demand by conducting a mixed methods studies, in which the qualitative phase, represented by semi -structured interviews and online open -ended survey, was responsible to identify the preliminary demand facto rs, while the quantitative phase, where the factors derived from the qualitative were tested on a larger sample for construct reliability and validity for the scale they have elaborated – Scale for eSports Spectator Demand (SESD) (Qian et al., 2019) .", "Through their study, Qian et al (2019) propose eight dimensions to measure eSports online spectator demand, being four of those dimensions unique to the eSports context (chat room, streamer traits, virtual rewards and stream quali ty) and four of them brought from the sport management literature (player characteristics, commentary features, event attractiveness and schedule convenience). Their proposition was tested using EFA, CFA and SEM and the dimensions that came up with the stu dy seem to address the unique factors of eSports demand in addition to the similarities with sport market demand.", "To contribute with spectator motivations in eSports, Hamari and Sjöblom (2017) tested an adapted version of a motivation scale that was developed focused on traditional", "sports, due to evidence of similarities between them, the Motivation Scale for Sport Consumption - MSSC (Trail & J ames, 2001) . They added novelty and aggressiveness to the scale. They concluded that, from the 10 dimensions used, escapism, acquiring knowledge, novelty and enjoyment of aggression were positively and statistically significantly associated with eSports watching frequency, while aesthetics was negatively associated, and the other factors did not present statistically significant associations. After them, Pizzo et al. (2018) went one step further with a comparative study between traditional sports (Korean Soccer League, K -League) and eSports of different types (FIFA Online 3, Sports Games; Starcraft 2, RTS). Industry reports, that suggested that eSports s pectator share similar motives with traditional sport spectator (PWC, 2016) , motivate d them to investigate this similarity. They mixed elements from the MSSC (Trail & James, 2001) and Sport Interest Inventory - SII (Funk, Mahony, & Ridinger, 2002) and used a single item for each of the 15 dimensi ons. They concluded that 11 of the 15 motives were similar on the 3 contexts and that although the results suggested that spectators of traditional sports and eSports share the same motives for sport consumption, the motives predicting game attendance freq uency were distinct across different event contexts.", "While Pizzo et al (2018) and Hamari and Sjöblom (2017) test the s port consumption motivation scales in an eSports context, advancing knowledge regarding relation between traditional sports and eSports, Qian et al (2019) focus on presenting new motives that are particular of eSports, bringing along factors related to the key attributes of eSports media products.", "Previous studies were responsible for supporting the existence of co ngruence between eSports and traditional sports (Cunningham et al., 2018; Hallmann & Giel, 2018; Heere, 2018; Pi zzo et al., 2018) , allowing that future research on eSports takes advantage of this expected association to investigate the eSports phenomenon from different perspectives.", "2.2 Identification", "2.2.1 Social Identity Theory", "The identification construct has been used in the sports marketing literature to describe a psychological relation an individual establishes towards a sports entity, be it a team, a sport or a sports celebrity (Madrigal, 2001) .", "A study by Ellemers , Kortekaas and Ouwerkerk (1999) proposed that there are three components that influence an i ndividual’s social identity, being one cognitive (self - categorization), one evaluative (group self -esteem), and one emotional (affective commitment). The self -categorization component relates to the cognitive awareness of membership in a social group, grou p self -esteem relates to a particular value connotation attached to the group membership and the affective commitment is related to a sense of emotional involvement the individual has with the group.", "The Social Identity Theory (SIT) approaches the importan ce of social groups to an individual as a source of recognition, identification and social inclusiveness. The theory is based upon the idea that humans are social beings and, therefore, belonging to social groups is part of human life and a need for an ind ividual’s psychological equilibrium. Also, according to SIT, an individual’s perception of itself is based on individual identity, such as personality traits, and social or collective identity, that comprehends identity traits that the individual shares wi th other people and groups and that are socially demonstrated (Tajfel et al., 1979) .", "Ashfort h and Mael (1989) also cont ributed to the social identity literature. According to their work, the individual’s perception of belonging to a specific group is shaped by the similarities to a group in contrast to differences to other social groups.

In the literature can be found studies related to identification between fans and a specific sport (Gwinner & Bennett, 2008) , sports event (Deitz, Myers, & Stafford, 2012) or sports teams (Amorim & Almeida, 2017; Fink, Trail, & Anderson, 2002) , which is the most explored. In the case of the fan -team identificat ion, for example, this relationship plays a significant role in the fan identity (Gwinner & Swanson, 2003) .", "The identification fans have with the team encourage the cre ation of communities due to the similarities among these fans (Qian et al., 2019) . According to Madrigal (2000) , a sponsor can receive a positive response from fans because, with the supports he gives to the team, he is perceived as a partner or even a member of the social group of the team fans, benefiting from the willingness to help that social group members have among them. However, evidence have been raised to support the idea that when that sponsor threatens the identity traits o f the team, that differentiate them from others, the fans response can be negative (Reysen, Snider, & Branscombe, 2012) .", "Trail, An derson and Fink (2005) found evidence that the fan’s purchasing behavior might be influenced by the identification between fan and team and, therefore, nurturing a stron g relation with fans is key to sponsors. Also, outside of the academy, IEG Sponsorship Report 1994 presented a study with NASCAR fans and found significative intention to prioritize or even switch brands just because of sponsorship. Different studies have investigated the influence of identification in sponsorship relations. Gwinner and Swanson (2003) found evidence that team identification influences sponsor recognition and sa tisfaction with sponsor, for example, and Madrigal (2000) found evidence that identification increase the chance of purc hasing sponsor’s products.", "The identification with eSports in general or competitive gaming related to a specific game is also a part of the fans identities and incentive them to create communities to discuss about anything related to their interest, even during the competitions, as can be observed in the chats available in broadcasted eSports competitions (Qian et al., 2019) . Also, people identified with eSports have been working hard for the last decade in order to grow eSports and keep pursuing growth.", "Based on the evidence found in the sports marketing literature regarding sponsorship and some similarities in both contexts, such as spectator motives (Pizzo et al., 2018) , it seems reasonable to suppose that a sponsor that is supporting in any way eSports or an individual’s preferred game competitions may be seen as a member in the fans social group and benefit from this membership, in a similar way to what have been seen in traditional sports.", "2.3 Sponsorship", "2.3.1 Defining Sponsorshi p", "Sponsoring sports, arts and charit ies started as a philanthropic activity, but over time moved to a more strategic approach, focused on achieving corporate objectives and seeing sponsorship as an investment, rather than just a good intention (Cornwell, Since the inception of sponsorshi p as a marketing strategy for companies, many have been the proposed definitions for the concept. One widely spread definition was created by the International Events Group (IEG), a consultancy company that has been an industry leader in the world of spons orship, which in 1982 defined sponsorship as “A cash and/or in -kind fee paid to a property (typically sports, entertainment, non -profit event or organization) in return for access to the exploitable commercial potential associated with that property.\"2. Also according to the glossary presented in IEG website, sponsorship is related to a property, described as “a unique, commercially exploitable entity, (typically in sports, arts, events, entertainment or causes)”. When the property of a specific sponsorship is an event, which is the case of this study, the term event marketing is preferable.", "In the academic literature, many other different definitions of sponsorship have been proposed. Meenaghan’s (1983) definition is commonly accepted, according to which sponsorship is “the provision of assistance e ither financial or in kind to an activity by a commercial organization for the purpose of achieving commercial objectives.”", "2 Extracted from IEG Lexicon and Glossary in http://www.sponsorship.com/Resources/IEG - Lexicon -and-Glossary.aspx", "Despite the wide variety of definitions for sponsorship, there is an important aspect that is present in all of them: the mutual ben efit between sponsor and the sponsored entity. In other words, the sponsorship relation is expected to be beneficial for both parts involved, although unforeseen facts might frustrate this expectation (such as a sponsored athlete being caught in the doping exam). To define sponsorship is also important to understand what differentiate it from traditional advertisement, and one key aspect regarding this distinction is that sponsorship persuasion to mass audience is implicit and indirect, while advertisement delivers the message direct and explicitly (Erdogan & Kitchen, 1998) .", "Other definitions are also very important in the sp onsorship context. For instance, the definition of endemic and non -endemic brands are vital to the understanding of how a sponsor can better invest his money to take the most out of a sponsorship relation.", "2.3.2 Endemic vs Non -endemic Sponsors", "An important classification of brands within the sponsorship domain is endemic and non -endemic brands. In the eSports context, being an endemic sponsor means that the company is native to the eSports and its products/services are related to eSports, while non-endemic s ponsors provide products/services that are not perceived as related with the eSports context (Gawrysiak, Burton, Jenny, & Williams, 2020) .", "A study conducted by the information and research company Nielsen (Pike & Master, 2017) in four important occidental eSports markets (U.S., UK, France and Germany) found evidence to support that eSports fans prefer endemic sponsors over non - endemic. For instance, Nielsen’s research suggests that 31% of eSports fans in France believe non -endemic brand activity is not at all appr opriate in the eSports context , while in the U.S. they estimate that 15% of fans share this belief.", "Pike and Master (2017) even propose a semi -endemic classification in the eSports context, in which they include technology brands not directly involved with gaming and eSports, energy drink and snack food manufacturer s, stating that, despite the fact that these companies does not provide truly gaming products/services, they are so ingrained in the eSports and broader gaming experience that they might not be considered non - endemic.", "Gawrysiak et al (2020) even propose a four -step ladder to present the evolution of eSports brandi ng and which would be the optimal entry points for both endemic and non - endemic sponsors, with the latter being advised to invest in eSports sponsorship once the sites, events and players are professionalized, while the endemic brands should be entering th e market a step before, what they call a context in which the solitary nature of games has been surpassed and the virtual nature of online gaming, encompassing competition and cooperation, is established.", "2.3.3 eSports Sponsorship", "Due to the recency of eSports i n comparison to traditional sports, the sponsorship of eSports events has been much less discussed in the literature. However, some characteristics are similar in the sponsorship in both industries. For instance, a company might invest in eight different t ypes of sports sponsorships, such as sports teams, sports celebrities, sports organizations, sports events, sports facilities and others (Fullerton & Merz, 2008; Lagae, 2005; Rines, 2000; Sá & Almeida, 2015) . The different types of sponsorship can also be seen in eSports, where brands can choose to sponsor a specific event or a charismatic and famous player.", "According to Lee and Ross (2012) , companies that invest in sports should have well defined the objectives they want t o achieve through the sponsorship in order to optimize their return, since the media coverage is not enough anymore (Grohs, Wagne r, & Vsetecka, 2004) . Usually, companies seek sponsoring opportunities aiming at profit oriented benefits, but intangible benefits, such as strengthening the brand, consolidate relationship with commercial partners (by inviting key clients to the events , providing them with unique experiences), and pursue organizational goals (such as bonding with employees) have been growing in importance over time (Cornwell & Maignan, 1998; Papadimitriou, Apostolopoulou, & Dounis, 2008; Sá & Almeida, 2015) . Despite the evidence raised in literature related to the positive impa ct of sports sponsorship in the sponsor’s brand equity (Donlan, 2014; Grohs et al., 2004; Gwinner & Eaton, 1999) , little have been discussed about this relationship in eSports. Also, to enhance the effectiveness, it is key that the sponsorship is integrated with the company’s marketing strategy (Donlan, 2014) and it is known that congruence between the sponsor and the sponsored entity might increase the chances of achieving the proposed objectives (Rifon, Choi, Trimble, & Li, 2004) .", "Meenaghan (2001) states that the perceived benefits of sponsorship are potentialized among the people most involved with the sponsored activity and, therefore, decision to sponsor a sports event is usually related to an intention to turn the company’s marketing strategy towards these consumers involved with the event. Based on this statement, together with the exponential growth of eSports as an industry, people identified with eSports have been perceived as an interesting and growing market for companies to target.", "In traditional sports sponsorship, it was argued by Nufer and Bühler (2010) , that sponsoring an event is much less riskier than investing on a partnership with a club, team or individual, because a private life scandal or some games lost in a row may impact negatively the sponsored image and, by image transfer, a lso impact negatively the sponsor’s image (Smith, 2004) . Little have been discussed about this different risk levels in the eSports context, but since relating your brand to an individual eSports pl ayer or an eSports team, seems to hold similar sources of risk to traditional sports players and teams. The perception of congruence is also proven to be a relevant factor in the relation between the sponsoring brand and the sponsored entity and will be ap proached in a particular sector, but IEG’s eSport sector update 2018 presented a balance between endemic and non -endemic brands as eSports sponsors (53% endemic vs. 47% non - endemic) (IEG, 2018) .", "2.4 Brand Equity", "2.4.1 Defining Brand Equity", "Sponsorship is typically related to consumer based brand equity, since the enhancement of brand awareness and brand image are some of the main goals of sponsorship in literature, which are dimensions of brand equity. A widely accepted definition of brand equity is the one from Aaker (1991) : “Brand equity is a set of brand assets and liabilities linked to a brand, its name and symbol, that add to or subtract from the value provided by a product or service to a firm a nd/or to that firm’s customers”.", "Aaker proposed the idea that brand equity is divided in four dimensions: brand loyalty, name awareness, perceived quality and brand association in addition to perceived quality. Keller (1993) also proposed dimensions for the brand equity concept, but he divided brand equity in two big dimensions: brand awareness and brand image, being the former related to brand recall and recognition performance by consum ers and the latter to the set of associations linked to the brand held in consumers’ memory. In the literature, brand equity can be measured through two different perspectives financial (firm based) and consumer based (Christodoulides & De Chernatony, 2010; Keller, 1993; Oliveira & Luce, 2012) . Purely financial evaluations are only relevant in specific situations, such as merger and acquisit ions. Also, the consumers’ perception of the brand marketing offers will impact their revenues and market share, reinforcing the relevance of the consumer based brand equity (CBBE), as being an antecedent financial value of the brand, or the firm based bra nd equity (FBBE) (Christodoulides & De Chernatony, 2010; Oliveira & Luce, 2012) .", "2.4.2 Consumer Based Brand Equity (CBBE)", "Measuring brand equity from the consumer perspective, focusing on understanding their behavior and perceptions is much more valuable for companies in order to enhance the effectiveness of their marketing strategies. Therefore, the most valuable asset in the brand equity context is the knowledge created about the brand in consumers’ mind (Keller, 1993) . Due to the verified relevance of the consumer perspective, this study will focus on the CBBE approach.", "According to Kotler and Keller (2015) a positive (negative) CBBE means that consumer s react favorably (unfavorably) to a product if they know the brand attached to the product. Therefore, CBBE measures the incremental value perceived by the consumer because of the presence of a specific brand. Keller also states that a high brand equity i s important to a company because it might increase the probability of brand choice, produce a greater consumer loyalty and decrease the vulnerability to competitive marketing actions.", "The exposure to the brand during an event is enough to impact positively many dimensions of brand awareness, also impacting positively CBBE (Donlan, 2014; Grohs et al., 2004) . Besides congruence, high levels of involvement with the event has also been", "verified in literature to potentialize the brand awareness of the sponsor (Grohs et al., 2004; Kim, Ko, Claussen, & Hee Kim, 2008) and also increase the chances of enhancing the corporate image (Kim, Ko, L. Clausse n, & Hee Kim, 2008) . Also, K im et al. (2008) verified that consumers highly involved with the event tend to show a higher purchase intention towards the sponsors’ products.", "Despite all the already proved benefits of sponsorship, potential sponsors should be careful with events that already have a significant number of sponsors, since the presence of a high number of sponsors might confuse the consumers, weakening their recall of the sponsoring brand s (Donlan, 2014; Nufer & Bühler, 2010) . This situation led the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to categorize the sponsorship, creating tiers of different benefits and that required different investments, in order to avoid the previously mentioned confusion. This strategy has been used in different kind of events since then. For instance, Game XP has Oi as a major sponsor.", "2.4.3 Measuring Brand Equity", "The brand equity can be measured direct or indirectly and both approaches are complementary, since the direct approach is important to indicate if the nature of the impact consumers perceive in the brand is positive or negative, while the indirect approach is useful in identifying which dimension are more significant to cause that differential (Keller, 1993) . While the direct approach measures the differential impact of brand equity in the consumers’ reactions, the indirect approach measures CBBE through its dimensions (Christodoulides & De Chernatony, 2010) .", "Scholars have developed scales to measure CBBE indirectly, looking for empirical evidence to support the mul tidimensionality, and, more specifically, the dimensions proposed by Aaker (1991) and Keller (1993) . Among the elaborated scales, the multidimensional brand equity (MBE), proposed by Yoo and Donthu (2001) , became one of the most used scales to measure CBBE in the academy (Christ odoulides & De Chernatony, 2010) . However, Aaker’s and Keller’s propositions are only partially validated, since the study in which the scale was elaborated only supported the influence of brand loyalty and perceived quality in CBBE, with the authors pr oposing that brand awareness and brand associations are put together as one single construct.", "Washburn and Plank (2002) retested and validated the three dimensions model propo sed by Yoo and Donthu (2001) and, according to the authors, the strong relation between brand awareness and brand assoc iations is explained due to the fact that people need to be aware of the existence of the brand in order to start making associations related to it. However, they also suggest that the inability to differentiate the two constructs, despite the clear distin ction of the concepts, is one of the major limitations of the scale. Besides the stated importance of Yoo and Donthu (2001 ) as a starting point for the development of multidimensional scales to measure CBBE, their study also proposed the creation of a direct scale to measure brand equity, the widely accepted overall brand equity (OBE). The OBE scale measures the incrementa l value attached to a product by its brand in comparison to a similar product unbranded (Buil, Martínez, & de Chernatony, The scale was widely tested in different co ntexts, being used independently (Ballester & Espallardo, 2008; Ballester & Munuera -Alemán, 2005; Woisetschläger, 2007) or together wit h Multidimensional Brand Equity (MBE) , to complement and validate de multidimensional scale (Bravo, Fraj -Andrés, & Martínez Salinas, 2007; Jung & Sung, 2008) . It was also tested in Brazil alone or together with MBE (Amorim & Almeida, 2017; Burlamaqui & Barbosa, 2006; Coelho, Amorim, & Almeida, 2019; Costa & Almeida, 2012; Vargas Neto & Luce, 2006) .", "2.5 Purchase Intention", "2.5.1 Sponsorship and Purchase Intention", "The consumer decision making process regarding the purchasing of a product has been discussed in the literature (Black well, Miniard, & Engel, 2001; Solomon, 2002) . The purchase intention is an intermediary step in the purchasing process, situated between the evaluation of the available options and the purchasing decision (Kotler & Keller, 2015) and was defined by Chang and Liu (2009) as ‘a customer’s plan to buy a specific brand’. Azjen (2002) also poses intention as the immediate antecedent of behavior and that in most of the cases it is a good predictor of behavior, despite not being enough to guarantee the behavior.", "Thinking about the consumers, Kotler and Keller (2015) present a model ( see appendix 1) representing the purchasing decision making process in which they indicate that there are factors between the purchase intention and purchase decision that can influence the process. They call it the intervening factors and they are the attitude of others (for instance, the more intense is the other person’s attitude an d the closer the person is from the decision maker, the more his purchase intention will be adjusted) and unanticipated situational factors (for example, losing the job or other purchase becoming more urgent). Because of that intervening factors, Kotler and Keller (2015) state that purchase intentions are not completely reliable predictors of behavior. Some studies have investigated the relation of sponsorship and purchase intention, which is related to a corporate objective of sponso rship: increasing sales. Evidence to support the idea that brand equity can affect the purchase intention have been found in the literature (Ashill & Sinha, 2004; Chang & Liu, 2009) . Madrigal (2000) investigated the influence of social alliances with sports team on intention to purchase sponsor’s products. Therefore, in summa ry, previous literature has found evidence that sponsorship activity influences consumer’s purchase intention, be it directly or by enhancing sponsor’s brand equity and, as a consequence, increasing purchase intention. On a corporate level, a ccording to Sá and Almeida (2015) there are six groups of the objectives observed in sports sponsorship: (1) corporate objectives (Cornwell, Pruitt, & Clark, 2005; Koo, Quarterman, & Flynn, 2006) ; (2) brand objectives (Cornwell et al., 2005) ; (3) product objectives (Rines, 2000) ; (4) audience objectives (Cornwell et al., 2005; Gwinner & Swanson, 2003) ; (5) relationship objecti ves (Cornwell et al., 2005; J. A. Meenaghan, 1983) ; and (6) executive’s personal objectives (J. A. Meenaghan, 1983) . The eSports context has not been widely explored as the sports context, but it seems reasonable to expect that the relations between sponsorship and purchase intention already investigated in the sports marketing literature may also occur in the eSports context.", "2.5.2 Purchase Intention measuring", "Many are the scales proposed in the literature to measure purchase intention used in different contexts. However, according to Blackwell, Engel and Miniard (2001) , to accurately measure if the cons umer would buy a product it is imperative to focus on the", "consumer’s perceptions related to the possibility of buying the product, not only if the consumer likes the product. They also argue that scales that present an element to measure the purchase as an action are, in general, superior to those that don’t. Pope and Voges (2000) conducted a study involving the purchase intention construct in which they applied one question proposed by Whitlark, Geurts and Swenson (1993) , operationalized through a 5 -item Likert scale that varies from ‘definitely will buy’ to ‘definitely will not buy’, to measure consumer’s purchase intention. Baker and Churchill (1977) used three questions to measure purchase intention, approaching the consumer’s willingness to try, buy or actively seek the product in stores. Based on their study, K im et al. (2008) conducted a sponsorship related study approaching consumer’s purchase intention towards 2002 FIFA World Cup sponsors’ products investigating if consumers were willing to try, buy or seek sponsor’s products or services. Spears and Singh (2004) proposed a 4 -item scale to measure purchase intention, which was also posteriorly used in other studies, such as Chavan at, Martinent and Ferrand (2009) that studied relations involving the brand image of 2006 FIFA World Cup, the French National Soccer Team, the French player Zinedine Zidane and the sponsoring company Adidas.", "Other disseminated s cale to measure purchase intention was proposed by Ohanian (1991) and posteriorly used in other studies (DeShields, Kara, & Kaynak, 1996; Pornpitakpan, 2004) . The scale is based on the dimensions of consider buying, inquiring about and actually purchasing the product/service, and was applied, in gene ral, to studies involving celebrity endorsers’ impact to the consumer’s purchase intention.", "2.6 Congruence", "2.6.1 Defining Congruence", "Congruence is commonly used to indicate a perception of similarity in the consumer’s mind, yet no widely accepted definition has been proposed (Rifon et al., 2004) . Speed and Thompson (2000) state that th e congruence indicates to which extent the sponsorship relation seems to make sense for consumers and they study also found", "evidence that some incongruence might even be considered as positive, because it might signal philanthropic intentions.", "Academic dis cussions over congruence rely on the idea that people make associations in their minds and that, together with these associations, people develop a perception that, in some of these associations, both sides have a match between them, while in others they o ppose themselves. According to Fleck and Quester (2007) , these perceptions impact the consumer’s response to stimuli that come from marketing strategies that include sponsorship, for example.", "The relevance of congruence as a variable in any sponsorship decision is undeniable. Johar and Pham (1999) found evidence that when consumers perceive a logical relation between the sponsor’s product and the sponsored event, they have higher chances of identifying a brand as a sponsor of the event. Also, scholars have found evidence that a strong congruence between sponsor and sponsored might impact positively the consumer’s attitude towards the sponsor and, consequently, the purchase intention (Hyung -Seok & Chang -Hoan, 2009; Speed & Thompson, 2000) . The studies related to congruence and image transfer are based upon two different theories developed in cognitive psychology: Associative Network Theory and Schema Theory (Drengner, Jahn, & Zanger, 2011) .", "2.6.2 Associative Network Theory and Schema Theory", "According to the Associative Network Theory, the human memory is organized as a network, in which the nodes are pieces of information. Those pieces of information are connected to each other with different intensities, meaning that some connections are stronger than others. The intensity varies according to the importance of the connect ion to the understanding of a concept. For instance, the information “car” is a node in the network that is probably related to “driving a car”, “particular old car I own” or “what to do if you see a red light” (Collins & Loftus, 1975) . Creating experiences with the brand will develop new connections in the brand’s node and, therefore, enhance its associative strength (Cornwell, 2008) .", "The theory also proposes that, when we want to retrieve information from our memory, a stimulus is generated in a node and spread across the connections to the nodes", "directly connected to it. This stimulus loses intensity as the distance to the node where the stimulus originated increases (Collins & Loftus, 1975) .", "The knowledge a person has in his own memory about a specific brand is a node in his memory network conne cted to other nodes, and one of that connections might be related to sponsorship (Keller, 1993) . Therefore, it is important for a brand to try to establish the most connections as possible, and t o make them as stronger as it can, in the consumer’s memory network.", "The mentioned importance explains the relevance of congruence in the network context. A congruent relation between sponsor and sponsored entity tends to strengthen the direct connection between those two parts, and, in addition, develop new indirect connections to the brand’s node. For instance, if in a person’s memory, the event node is connected to “health”, a successful sponsorship attempt might develop an indirect connection between t he brand’s node and “health” (Cornwell, Humphreys, Maguire, Weeks, & Tellegen, 2006) .", "In summary, a sponsorship relation perceived as congruent tend to develop stronger direct associations and more indirect associations , making people more prone to remember and r ecognize the brand (Koo et al., 2006) . In contrast, incongruent relations generate weak associations bet ween brand and sponsored entity, making it harder for people to remember (Cornwell et al., 2006) . Also, it seems that in situations where the connections already exist, the image transfer between them seems to be easier. Other theory related to the human memory and how information is connected is t he Schema Theory, according to which information is kept in schemas that can be informally defined as pre -existing assumptions a person have about how the world is organized (J. The theory states that, when a new piece of information is received, the individual, in an attempt to process and understand it, will try to fit it a schema previously used in a similar context. The more naturally the information fits in the previously tested schema, smoother will be the process. However, if the information struggles to fit the pattern created in his mind, a person might use infer ences and even distort the information received, in order for the information to make sense to him (Axelrod, 1973) .", "So, according to the schema theory, when the schema a person ha s related to a specific event is consistent with the knowledge it has of the sponsor’s brand, the relation is perceived as congruent. For instance, a sports related company sponsoring a sports event or a car manufacturer sponsoring a F1 race will probably fit easier in pre -existent schemas related to both parts, defining a congruent relation. Because people expect those relations, they are easier to process and keep in mind (Drengner et al., 2011) .", "2.6.3 Congruence between Sponsor and Property", "Many are the studies in the sponsorship literature that were dedicated to investigating the impact of the perceived congruence in a sponsorship relation in the consumer’s response and they were direct ed toward different kinds of sponsored entities, being the event sponsorship the most present in those studies (Deitz et al., 2012) . Evidence was also found to support that previous experience and the social identification may impact individual perceptions of congruence (Deitz et al., 2012) . Also, those congruence perceptions can be based on functionality or image. For instance, a running shoes manufacturer sponsoring a marathon is trying to take advantage of congruence based on functionality, while a luxury brand sponsoring a contest of luxury related sport, such as golf, is thinking about congruence based on image. Fleck and Quester (2007) present another approach to congruence, stating that the perception of congruence between th e sponsor and the sponsored entity is influenced by the relevance of that relation for both parts and the expectancy of that relationship, being it for functional reasons or historical reasons, such as the relationship built between Coca - Cola and the Olymp ics.", "2.6.4 Measuring Congruence between Sponsor and Property", "The importance of congruence between sponsor and sponsored property to achieve positive response from consumers is already established by many previous studies. However, those studies treat congruence differently. While in some of them congruence is treated like a condition (dichotomy between high congruence and low congruence) (Rifon et al., 2004) , others try to measure it (Deitz et al., 2012) . In one of those studies focused on measuring the relative strength of mental associations in consumer’s minds, Speed and Thompson (2000) developed a 5 -item scale", "that try to embrace abstract notions of congruence. Their study suggests that consumer’s response to sponsorship is impacted by consumer’s attitude towards the sponsor, towards the event and his ind ividual perception of congruence between them. Speed and Thompson’s (2000) scale was widely used worldwide (Close Scheinbaum & Lacey, 2013; Deitz et al., 2012; Olson & Thjomoe, 2011) . Among those studies, Deitz et al. (2012) highlighted the significant role of congruence as an influencer of consumer’s response to sponsorship, Close Scheinbaum and Lacey (2013) stated that the perception of congruence is a relevant variable to the perception the spectators have of a sponsor and Olson (2011) verified the validity of the scale outside of the sports context, through a comparative study in sports events and cultural events.", "In Brazil, Speed and Thompson’s (2000) scale was also tested (Amorim & Almeida, 2017; Coelho et al., 2019) .

In eSports competition streams on the internet, the chat provides a tool to facilitate this social interaction among eSports fans watching the matches (Qian et al., 2019) . Also, Pizzo et al (2018) studied spectator’s mo tives and found evidence that support similarities between eSports and traditional sports.

In the first study, conducted with two different hotel brands, t hey found evidence of the effect of brand equity on consumer’s usage intentions, and in the second study, involving competing brands of cleansers, the evidence was reinforced.

For instance, evidence was found to support that the perception of congruence influences consumers’ cognitive and affective responses toward the sponsors (Deitz et al., 2012; Koo et al., 2006) , sponsor recognition (Koo et al., 2006) , sponsor identification (Johar & Pham , 1999) , purchase intention (Gwinner & Bennett, 2008) , and sponsor’s brand equity (Amorim & Almeida, 2017; Coelho et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2011) .", "Congruence’s perception influence on consumer’s responses are in accordance with the way human memory works, according to Schema Theory (Axelrod, 1973; Gwinner & Eaton, 1999) and Associative Network Theory (Collins & Loftus, 1975; Cornwell et al., 2006) . Koo, Quarterman and Flynn (2006) suggest that any newly received information about the brand by the consumer that seems irrelevant to the existing schema in their memory will likely be filtered out, while relevant information is more easily assimilated by the consumer. Therefore, the fit perception in the sponsorship relation by the preexisting schema in the individual’s memory might gen erate more and stronger connections related to the brand’s node, consolidating the brand in the most identified fan’s minds.", "Rifon et al.

The congruence in that relationship se em more real for the consumers, providing evidence for them to believe that it was genuinely motivated by generosity. Congruence influence in the sponsorship context has been widely supported by the literature. The perceived fit in the consumers’ mind betw een the two entities in a sponsorship relation can be very positive for the sponsoring company (, allowing them to potentialize the benefits they take from their sponsorship investments.

There were seven interviewers and 232 questionnaires were collected in a single event Similarly, t he collection took place outside the entrance of the event, which happened through a single entrance , and 43 were collected inside the arena . Also similarly to Game XP, t he entrance was crowded with many people approaching the visitors for different reasons (interviewers doing other academic research and people selling products or reselling tickets), but on a smaller scale . The interviewers were told to randoml y approach people asking if they were willing to participate in the survey and, since there was no filter question for this event because it was just focused in eSports, start the interview in case of positive response .", "The most efficient moment of collection was also before the gates were open, when the visitors were idle in the queue. During this event, the access to the queue was easier and the interviewers perceived the event spectators as more receptive to help with the research. 232 questionnai res were collected and all of them were in accordance to the previously defined requirements.", "4.7 Data Preparation", "Even though the study involved two versions of the questionnaire with two different sponsors, they followed the exact same order of the items. Tw o databases w ere formed, one for each event and they were analyzed separately , in order to investigate the relationship between the constructs in each specific event and the respective sponsor. The tabulation process also comprised the adaptation of yes/no questions into binary variables (0 or 1), being 0 related to ‘yes’ and 1 to ‘no’. Also the item related to gender became a binary variable, being 0 related to ‘male’ and 1 to ‘female’. Finally, schooling was defined as a variable ranging from 0 to 3. In B razil, education is divided in three main blocks: ‘fundamental’, ‘médio’ and ‘superior’ (or ‘1º grau’, ‘2º grau’ and ‘superior’). Differently from the American system, the 0 to 3 range goes from ‘1º grau incompleto’,", "that comprises people that have not fin ished the basic education yet (and compares to not having completed the first year of high school in USA), to ‘superior completo’ (people who completed undergraduate school in USA). After the Game XP event, the schooling question was modified, combining th e two first options together and modifying the phrasing to ‘Ensino Fundamental’ (‘1º grau incompleto’ and ‘1º grau completo’ in the Game XP questionnaire), ‘Ensino Médio’ (‘2º grau completo’) and ‘Ensino Superior’.", "4.8 Data Analysis", "In total, 446 questionnaire s were collected during the Game XP event and 232 during the CBLoL Finals. The data relative to both event s was consolidated separately on Excel spreadsheet s.", "The data collection generate d two databases, one relative to each event, and they were analyzed separately. First, the database from Game XP w ere analyzed, and then the data collected during the CBLoL Finals. For the exploratory analysis the software SPSS v.20 were used and for the validation of the scales and the hypothesis testing the sof tware AMOS v.2 6 were used.", "4.8.1 Sample Characteristics", "First, an analysis was made in order to better understand the general characteristics of the sample. The main objective for that analysis is to verify the composition of the sample in terms of gender, age and education level. Also to see what portion of the sample was a first time in -person spectator of eSports and a first time in -person spectator of the specific event in which they were interviewed.", "4.8.2 Descriptive Analysis", "The descriptive analysis comprise d univariate and multivariate analysis. It is important to evaluate frequency, mean and standard deviation of each variable individually. The sample was characterized and the groups were analyzed according to gender, education, previous experience with being an in -person spectator of eSports, previous experience with the event and previous experience with the sponsor brand . Also, the age distribution of the sample was analyzed.", "4.8.3 Exploratory Factor Analysis", "Factor analysis is an interdependence technique whose primary purpose is to define the underlying structure among the variables in the analysis. Factor analysis provides the tools for analyzing the structure of the interrelationship (correlations) among a large number of variables (e.g. test items, questionna ire responses) by defining sets of variables that are highly interrelated, known as factors. These groups of variables (factors) which are by definition highly intercorrelated, are assumed to represent dimensions within the data (Hair, Anderson, Black, & Babin, 2016) .", "Factor analytic techniques can achieve their purposes either from an exploratory or confirmatory perspective. Many researchers advocate in favor of the exploratory perspective, by arguing that, in this perspect ive, factor analytic techniques “take what data give you”, without setting any a priori constraint on the estimation of the components or the number of components to be extracted. However, despite this use of factor analysis being appropriate for many of t he possible applications, there are situations in which the researcher has preconceived thoughts on the actual structure of the data, based on theoretical support or prior research. In situations like that, the researcher requires that factor analysis take a confirmatory approach, assessing the degree to which the data meet the previously expected structure. By providing insight into the relationship among variables and the underlying structure of the data, factor analysis is an excellent starting point for other multivariate techniques (Hair et al., 2016) .", "According to Hair et al. (2016) , the factor analysis decision process is divided in six stages. The first stage comprises the understanding of the intended objectives of the factor analysis. This stage is related to the research problem and it involves searching and defining the fundamental constructs or dimensions assumed to underlie the original variables. The second stage is related to the design of the factor analysis. It involve s three basic decisions: (1) calculation of the input data to meet the specified objectives of grouping variables or respondents; (2) design the number of variables, measurement properties of variables and types of allowable variables (3) sample size neces sary. The third stage involves the assumptions in factor analysis, which are more conceptual than statistical in the case of factor analysis.", "The fourth stage is where the factor analysis properly starts in order to identify the underlying structure of rel ationships between variables. This stage requires decisions", "concerning (1) the method of extracting factors (common factor analysis x component analysis) (2) the number of factors to represent the underlying structure in the data. The fifth stage is relate d to the factors’ interpretation. This stage comprises three processes: estimate of the factor matrix, factor rotation (orthogonal x oblique) and factor interpretation and respecification. The final stage involves the validation of the factor analysis, whi ch can be executed by moving to a confirmatory perspective. Hair et al. (2016) also propose an additional stage related to additional uses of factor analysis results. When the primary objective is to identify the latent dimensions or construct s represented in the original variables, the common factor analysis is most appropriate (Hair et al., 2016) . Therefore, the Principal Axis Factoring with extraction based on eigenvalue will be used. Since the literature supports the relationship between constructs, the oblique rotation should be used. There are two important indicators to be used to evaluate EFA adequacy: Kaiser -Meyer -Olkin (KMO), that is expected to be above 0.5, and the Bartlett’s test of sphericity, that is expected to present sig. < 0.05.", "The Cronbach’s Alpha is an important reliability coefficient. It assesses the internal consistency of scales. It is expected to be above 0.7 for each specific scale. Hair et al. (2016) state that a problem with the Cronbach’s Alpha is that it is positively related with the number of items in a scale and, therefore, a scale with a large number of items might artificially inflate the alpha. Since this study involves scales that goes from 3 to 5 items, this doesn’t seem to be a pr oblem.", "The underlying structure is usually analyzed through factor loadings. The factor loadings are important to verify if the factors fit within the constructs, being expected that the factor loadings are above 0.5. To verify the convergent validity and discriminant validity, a correlation matrix was generated. In order to achieve convergent validity, it is necessary that the correlation coefficients between items inside the same factor are above 0.3, while for discriminant validity, it is necessary that the correlation coefficients between items from different factors are below 0.3.", "4.8.4 Confirmatory Factor Analysis", "While the distinctive feature of EFA is that the factors are derived from statistical data, in CFA, they come from theory. With CFA, researcher mu st specify the number of factors and which factor each variable will load on before results can be computed,", "differently from EFA, in which the factors that emerge can only be named after the factor analysis is performed. Therefore, this technique does not assign variables to factors, this role being executed by the researcher based on theory, being each variable assigned to one single factor. In summary, CFA statistics will tell how well the researcher’s theoretical specification of the factors matches the empirical data. Therefore, CFA is a tool that enables to “confirm” or “reject” preconceived theory (Hair et al., 2016) . It is necessary that the normality of the multiple variables is verified, which can be done through kurtosis indicators, whic h will be obtained with AMOS software. Some are the indicators that are important to measure quality of fit of the model. Some of them are: Chi -square ( χ2), normed Chi -square, Goodness of Fit (GFI), Comparative Fit Index (CFI) and Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA). Chi-square is one of the most widely used indicators of model quality, being a non-significant value of χ2 considered an indicator of good model fit. However, χ2 is negatively correlated to some factors, such as the number of observ ations in the study, which makes it unlikely that χ2 will not be significant in cases with more than 400 observations. If this is the case, the evaluation of normed Chi -square is suggested, since it is a simple ratio of χ2 to the degrees of freedom. Usuall y, a ratio of 3:1 or less is an indicator of better -fitting model (Hair et al., 2016) , but even if this condition is satisfied it is important to look to other indicators.", "It is also expected that both the GFI and the CFI are above 0.9 so that th e model can be considered to have a good fit. The CFI is an incremental indicator, in the sense that it compares the model to a null model, penalizing the proposed model for the number of estimated parameters. Finally, the RMSEA tries to correct for both m odel complexity and sample size by including each in its computation. The lower the RMSEA, better the fit, with the cutoff to a good RMSEA still being debatable according to Hair et al. (2016) , ranging from 0.5 and 0.8. However, recent researc h points that it is not advisable to define an absolute cutoff for RMSEA.", "The Construct Reliability (CR) will be used to verify the reliability of the constructs. The CR is a measure of reliability and internal consistency of the measured variables represe nting a latent construct. According to Hair et al. (2016) CR should be above 0.7 in order to indicate adequate convergence or internal consistency.", "The Average Variance Extracted (AVE) will also be evaluated. AVE is calculated as the mean vari ance extracted for the items loading on a construct and is a summary indicator of convergence. It is computed as the total of all squared standardized factor loadings divided by the number of items. According to Hair et al. (2016) , an AVE of 0 .5 or higher is a good indicator of adequate convergence. Also, if the square of the correlations between constructs is equal or lower than the AVE of the construct, the discriminant validity is verified.", "4.8.5 Substantive Hypothesis Testing", "The technique select ed to test the substantive hypothesis is the Structural Equations Modeling (SEM). According to Hair et al. (2016) , differently from other multivariate techniques, SEM can examine a series of dependence relationships between variables simultane ously and, therefore, is particularly useful in testing theories that contain multiple equations involving dependence relationships. Other multivariate techniques, such as multiple regression and factor analysis, are limited in the sense that they provide powerful tools to examine a single relationship at a time. In other words, SEM is a family of statistical models that seek to explain the relationships among multiple variable, by examining the structure of interrelationships expressed in a series of equat ions (similar to a series of multiple regression equations), where these equations depict all of the relationships among constructs involved in the analysis. Therefore, SEM can be thought as a unique combination of interdependence and dependence technique (Hair et al., 2016) .", "With the SEM technique, coefficients will be calculated to the previously hypothesized paths in the conceptual model that will be analyzed. Also, to evaluate the significance of the paths’ coefficients it is indicated to cons ider a criterion of p -value below 0.05 in order to support the hypotheses (Hair et al., 2016) . The hypotheses H1, H2 and H3 will be tested through the analysis of significance of the paths. For the mediating hypothesis H4, the four steps proposed by Baron and Kenny (1986) and the Sobel (1982) test will be used to verify the si gnificance of the mediation effect. The four steps involve the isolation of the variables in order to verify each relationship individually. In the first step, evaluates the influence of the independent variable on the dependent variable. Then, the influen ce of the independent variable on the", "mediating variable is evaluated. The third step comprises the evaluation of the influence of the independent variable and the mediating variable on the dependent variable, excluding the direct relationship between inde pendent and mediating variables. Finally, during the fourth step, the influence of the mediating variable on the relationship between independent and dependent variables is verified. If the steps one to three present significant results, a partial mediatin g effect is indicated. However, if all steps present significant results, it indicates total mediation of the relationship.", "5 RESULTS", "This chapter presents the research results separately for each event where data was collected.

Differently from Game XP, this event was an eSports specific event, with the competition itself being the main attraction.", "Regarding the previous experience with CBLoL, only 23.3% had already been to other edition of the event. Di fferently from Game XP (that was still on their early years), this was the 15th CBLoL event that could be watched in -person. However, it does not happen always in the same city. This edition was the 2nd held in Rio (the other one was in 2014). Some reasons might explain the fact that almost half of the people interviewed had never watched in -person eSports events before, such as the fact that in -person eSports competitions are not so frequent in Rio and they are usually broadcast with high quality on the in ternet. Also, people that had previously owned a computer from Dell were 46.6% of the sample, which might influence their perception of the brand.", "The distribution of the sample by age is presented below ( Fig. 5 ).

The criteria selected to validate the weights calculated in the analysis was that they should be above 0.50, and all of them were above 0.515. The explained variance Besides the factor loadings, more results were analyzed in order to confirm the EFA adequacy, and the reliability and validity of the constructs. At first the MSA indexes were analyzed for each item (in order to verify the EFA adequacy) and the Cronbach’s alphas were analyzed for each construct. For the MSA, values above 0.5 were expected, and they were all above 0.588, suggesting the EFA adequacy. Regarding the Cronbach’s alpha, the referen ce value to verify the reliability of the constructs is α > 0.7, and the Identification with eSports construct presented a value below that threshold (0.619). This might have happened due to the fact that the scale was trying to measure the identification with eSports in general (i.e. one item asks about considering itself a fan of many different eSports), and for this specific event, the public was focused on a specific eSports competition (League of Legends), differently from Game XP. Then, the communalit y was analyzed, with values expected to be above 0.5 for each item individually. Two items inside the Identification with eSports construct were below the expected value of 0.5: IDeS_2 and IDeS_3 , presenting values of 0.284 and 0.304, respectively. Finall y, the convergent and discriminant validities were verified through the Correlation Matrix ( Table 15).

For the discriminant validity, the correlation between items from different scales were analyzed and many of the items from the constructs Brand Equity, Congruence and Purchase Intention had correlations above 0.3 between them, although with less intensity than for Game XP data.

Testing the hypothesis, the direct influence of Identification with eSports in the spectator’s perception of the sponsor Brand Equity was not supported and this perception’s direct influence in the spectator’s Purchase Intention towards the sponsor’ products/services was supported.

Also the mediating influence of the congruence perception between the sponsor and eSports on the relationship between the spectator’s identification with eSports and his perception of the sponsor’s brand equity. This study contributes to eSports marketing literature and use as main theoretical reference the Social Identity Theory (Tajfel et al., 1979) , Associative Network Theory (Collins & Loftus, 1975) and Schema Theory (Axelrod, 1973) . The research questions were operationalized through three substantive research hypotheses regarding the relationship between the studied constructs.", "Data was collected th rough surveys that were asked in -person at the entrance of two events that hosted eSports competitions: Game XP and CBLoL. Both events were held in the city of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and Game XP had a wider variety of attractions so attending the event to watch eSports was a filter question. Each event generated a unique sample, being the data analyzed separately for each specific event. During four days of Game XP, 446 valid questionnaires were collected and in one day of CBLoL, 232 valid questionnaires w ere collected.", "To analyze the data, first was performed an Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA), followed by a Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA). The reliability was assessed, together", "with the constructs’ convergent and discriminant validities. To test the substantive hypotheses, a Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) analysis was performed, using the Asymptotically Distribution -Free (ADF) technique. Also, to support the mediating effect of the congruence between the sponsor and eSports were also performed the Four Steps proposed by Baron and Kenny (1986) , the Sobel Test (1982) and bootstrapping. For both events, two of the substantive hypotheses were supported, with the direct influence of the spectator identification with eSports on his own perception of the sponsor’s brand equity not being supported on the presence of congruence between the sponsor and eSports as a mediator. This mediating influence being supported, it was verified to be a total mediation.", "6.2 Theoretical Implications", "This section presents this study’s academic contributions, by answering the research questions.", "6.2.1 Question 1: Does the spectators’ identification with eSports influences the sponsor’s brand equity?", "The results from this study pointed to contradictory answers for that question. In fact, they suggest that the spectators’ identification with eSports influences the sponsor’s brand equity, but indirectly through the mediation of t he congruence perception between the sponsor and eSports.", "However, when looking specifically to the direct influence, which is what this research question intended to investigate, the results from one event supported it (even if weak) , while the other even t pointed to a non -significant relation between the variables. eSports is a relatively recent field and academic research is still incipient, but we can speculate over the reasons for this contradiction. It might be explained due to the classification of t he sponsors as endemic or non -endemic brands , but further research is still required to provide more evidence to this possibility . While Dell is undoubtedly an endemic brand when related to eSports, since they produce computers, Oi is not an endemic brand, despite the fact that they are internet providers. Oi also provides a variety of services that are not related to eSports and when you ask about the brand, the internet services might not come to people’s minds initially. Therefore, this contextualization", "might explain that, when in the presence of congruence, the value spectator’s perceive in Dell’s brand (an endemic brand) is explained by that congruence per ception, differently from Oi.", "The results suggest that, it may be the case that when the sponsor i s an endemic brand, the congruence perception is responsible for the enhancement of the value perceived in the brand by the spectator, reinforcing the importance of fit between sponsor and sponsored entity.", "Also, the events were different and attracted dif ferent people. Game XP is an event with a variety of attractions related to games (in which eSports competition is just a small portion), while CBLoL is an event entirely dedicated to eSports and, even more, to a specific game (League of Legends). This dif ferences may have influenced the identification with eSports variable, that tried to measure identification as a eSports fan in general, instead of as a fan of a specific game.", "It is also intriguing about this results in this specific relationship is also related to the fact that in one event it was non -significant while the other, although supported, indicated a weak relationship. This results also leave room to speculate if the spectator’s identification with eSports is really relevant to influence direct ly his perception about the sponsor’s brand equity , but once more, further research is required to test this possibility . 6.2.2 Question 2: Does the sponsor’s brand equity influences the spectator’s purchase intention towards the sponsor’s products/services?", "The results from this study support the existence of the influence of the sponsor’s brand equity on spectator’ purchase intention towards the sponsor’s products/services. This conclusion is intuitive, pointing to the fact that the more value someone perceives in a brand, higher are his/hers intention to buy (or hire) from that company. The direct influence of brand equity on consumer’s purchase intention have been widely supported in different contexts, with different kinds of products and services, such as ho tels and cleansers (Cobb -Walgren et al., 1995) , flights (Hsin Chang & Wen Chen, 2008) , bank credit cards, mobile telecommunication and ADSL (Chang & Liu, 2009) . Jalilvand et al. (2011) even found ev idence to support the influence of each individual component of brand equity, as proposed by Aaker (1991) on consumer’s purchase intention.", "That influence had also been previously supported in the literature in sponsorship contexts (Alrayees & Saleh, 2019; Chanavat et al., 2009; Ngoc Khuong & Chau, 2017; Pope & Vo ges, 2000) , even with the impact of celebrity endorsement on purchase intention (Düsenberg et al., 2016; Pornpitakpan, 2004) . However, little, if any, evidence was found in previous literature to support this relationship in an eSports context and this study’s findings support this influence in this specific context. Therefore, supporting the existence of the hypothesized relationship in the eSp orts context, reinforces the findings from previous studies that verified the same relationship in different contexts. 6.2.3 Question 3: Does the spectators’ perception of congruence between eSports and the sponsor’s brand has a mediating effect in the relation between the spectators’ identification with eSports and the sponsor’s brand equity?", "The results suggest that congruence exerts an important mediating effect on the sponsorship relation, reinforcing previous findings that the perception of congruence betwee n sponsor and sponsored entity might influence attitude towards the sponsor (Gwinner & Bennett, 2008; Speed & Thompson, 2000) , sponsor’s image and recognition (Grohs et al., 2004; Koo et al., 2006) , and, specifically for this study, purchase intention (Close Scheinbaum & Lacey, 2013) . Some interesting discussions can also be raised from the results for this hypothesis.", "First, it is i nteresting to observe that the moderating variable, or the perceive d congruence between the sponsor and eSports, has a stronger contribution to the brand equity perception than the spectator’s identification with eSports. This reinforces the importance of congruence between sponsor and sponsored entity (in this study’s ca se, eSports events), specifically if enhancing the branding equity is one of the sponsorship objectives.", "Other thought provoking discussion that emerges from the results of the analysis performed in this study is related to the different roles that congrue nce plays while mediating the relationship between identification with eSports and the perception of sponsor’s brand equity. In the Game XP event, with an non -endemic brand (Oi), congruence plays a partial mediator role, with the direct influence of identi fication on brand equity keeping its significance (although the indirect influence is still much stronger). However, for the CBLoL database, with an endemic brand (Dell), congruence", "works as a total mediator, which means that the all the effect of identifi cation on brand equity was indirect, being mediated by congruence.", "In summary, the results suggest that congruence perception, being it natural or built by the brand, strengthens the intensity with which the sponsorship enhances the sponsor’s brand equity. This seems in line with the Associative Network Theory and the Schema Theory, since through the lens of those theories the congruence perception is related to concepts being closer to each other in people’s minds and the closer they are, less connections the sponsor needs to build in people’s minds to connect their brand with eSports and benefit from the good feelings consumer’s have associated with this concept in their minds. This results reinforce previous findings in the literature regarding the import ance of congruence in sponsorship (Coelho et al., 2019; Henseler, Wilson, Götz, & Hautvast, 2007) .", "6.3 Managerial Implications", "Sponsors that invest in eSports entities with the objective of bringing value to their brands will have much more success if they are capable of creating, promoting and capitalizing on a mental connection that associates their brand with the sponsored entity somehow. Th is connection can be natural (as in the case of Dell and other endemic brands), or can be forged over time. In summary, looking for endemic sponsorships makes life easier for sponsors. However, independently of the sponsorship being endemic or not, communi cation is vital to create and sustain the connections on consumers’ minds. The findings that emerge from this study provide insights and have practical implications for people who work with eSports marketing, events or sponsorships and even for companies w ho invest in sponsorship.", "6.3.1 For Companies that Sponsor (or are willing to) eSports", "Sponsorship investments tend to be expensive, require planning and detailed objectives. However, if they are successful, they can b e significantly profitable. Therefore, thinking on optimizing the return on the sponsorship investment, being capable of having the same return with lower investments (both in capital and labor) is a significant advantage .", "Also, this study’s results suggest that when the sponsor is an endemic brand, the congruence perception is responsible for enhancing the value the spectator perceive in the brand, reinforcing the importance of fit between the sponsor and the sponsored entity. This is enough of an argument to support the search for endemic sp onsorship opportunities or the ones that are closest to your brand, product or service. It is important to mention that a company can profit from a non -endemic sponsorship, but it will require much more investment and effort from the company side, since a congruent sponsorship is much more natural and fluid on consumer’s minds, while a non -endemic sponsor will have to work on developing a connection between their brand and the sponsored entity somehow . Therefore to worth the investment, the market needs to be big and consolidated , and the eSports market is moving rapidly towards that direction. This can be verified by the amount of big non -endemic brands , such as Coca - Cola and Mercedes that have moved their eSports investment from experimental marketing budg et to the core sponsorship line up, helping to fuel market growth (D. Singer & Chi, 2019) . These big non -endemic companies have higher sponsorship budgets and are gradually increasing their presence in the eSports market.", "Despite the fact that brand activation is key for every sponsor, f or the non -endemic companie s, saving a shar e of their budget for brand activations during the events and other initiatives that can help forge unnatural connections between their brand and the eSports market is vital, since their distance to eSports in consumer’s mind is bigger than from endemic br ands. In other words, they have a longer way to travel to reach the same destination . Also, for both classifications of sponsor s being able to understand the eSports audience might facilitate their life and allow companies activations to be more assertive. Finally , having the relationship between the perception of brand equity and consumer’s purchase intention supported can help marketing professionals to support sponsorship decisions , since this implies that enhancing brand equity can increase sales .", "6.3.2 For E ntities responsible for organizing eSports events", "eSports is a fast growing market both in terms of audience and financial returns. Therefore, to keep growing it is important that they can reach new people and bring new fans to keep it growing. eSports eve nts’ organizers have been focusing on providing an in-person experience that differentiates the event from watching the competition through", "streaming at home. In this difficult task to provide a completely differentiated experience for those who watch an e Sports event in person, companies may be interesting partners, not only for the money they invest in sponsorship that allow companies to elaborate attractions for the event, but being creative with their activations during the event and providing interesti ng experiences to entertain the spectators.", "In summary , for the eSports industry as a whole , it is fundamental that sponsorship grows together with the audience, in order to provide financial support to keep the industry growth sustainable and to provide v isibility to eSports as a whole.", "6.4 Limitations of the Study", "This section present s the study limitations that are related to some options that were made regarding method.

For instance, s ponsorship activations level during the event (O’Reilly & Horning, 2013) and spectator’s previous attitude towards the sponsor (Koo et al., 2006) are variables that also influence the spectators’ perception of sponsor’s brand equity and, if were considered in the model, would proba bly lead to different results.", "The study considers two different kinds of sponsors with one sponsor focused on products and one focused on services, and also two different kind of events, being one a games -themed festival that also includes eSports competi tions and the other an event totally focused on the eSports competition.

However, the results of this study cannot be generalized for contex ts in which asymmetry is verified between the sponsor’s and the event’s brand equity.", "6.4.2 Limitations regarding the Operationalization of the Scales Preference was given to scales that were already tested in previous studies, always looking for scales that wer e even tested in Brazil. No previous studies using the selected identification scale were found in Brazil. However, due to the intention to measure the identification as a general eSports fan . In general, scales related to identification in sports marketin g are related to identification with a specific sport modality, a specific team/club or a specific player . Therefore, due to the lack of other scales for the desired construct, that scale was selected . Also, the fit scales from Speed and Thompson (2000) was developed to measure event -sponsor congruence, but it was adjusted to measure the sponsor’s fit with eSports in general.", "Also, previous tests were found of the scales in studies related to the traditional sports context, which is slightly different from the eSports context , although evidence have been provided in previous studies to support the similarities between eSports and traditional sports (Pizzo et al., 2018) .", "6.4.3 Limitations regarding the Sample and Data Collection", "This study randomly pick ed people while they were arriving to two different events as a sample. However, the samples are very different, since Game XP holds competitions from many different eSports while CBLoL only provides the spectator the opportunity to watch a competition of League of Legends. Theref ore, to extrapolate the results of this study to other events should be done with caution. During both event s, the data collection was made specifically with people arriving at the event and, at that point, they were not yet impacted by the sponsor’s activ ations inside the event. Therefore, their perceptions regarding the sponsor could have been different if they were interviewed while exiting.", "It is also important to highlight the impact of having many different interviewers in the study. Even though they were trained, when using different interviewers it is possible that a bias caused by the interviewer might occur.

Also, more evidence to support the mediating effect between identification and the sponsor brand equity, or even between the sponsor brand equity and any antecedent variable, is interesting. Also, this study is conducted through the lens of the Social Id entity Theory.

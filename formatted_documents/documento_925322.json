"Figure 1: Brazilian assets’ diversiﬁcation properties from February 2008 to July 2018. Thedashed line shows the monthly conditional correlation between Brazilian assets’ excessreturns and stock excess return. The solid live shows the monthly conditional correlationbetween Brazilian assets’ excess returns and bonds excess return.The conditional correlation between stocks and bonds in the period examined showsa persistent positive correlation (median of 41.86%) with short periods of sharp increase(high of 54.33%) and decrease (low of 29.47%). A portfolio of Brazilian equity and bonds,therefore, has little diversiﬁcation.Mutual funds and listed real estate present similar correlation with bonds and equity.Both assets have a high conditional correlation with stocks throughout the period ana-lyzed, median of 92.50 % and 78.71%, respectively. Mutual funds high correlation withbonds an equity index is expected due to the asset class’ typical allocation in equities and19 bonds.The listed real estate high correlation, however, should be considered carefully. Listedreal estate indices are based on publicly traded companies, which are subjected to thesame economic factors aﬀecting all companies listed on a stock exchange. Thus, listedindices tend to have a high correlation with publicly traded stocks and bonds indices.Hoevenaars et al. (2008).Hoevenaars et al. (2008) report a correlation of 65% between American listed realestate and the S&P composite index. The signiﬁcant higher correlation observed in Brazilcan be explained by the relative small number of public traded company listed in theBrazilian stock exchange (B3). A large part (61.54%) of the listed real estate companiesthat make up the IMOB index are also present in the IBRX100 broad index. These listedreal estate companies account for 83% of the IMOB’s index allocation.Hedge funds correlation with bonds and equities change signiﬁcantly during the pe-riod analyzed. It follows a V-shaped pattern, with signiﬁcant higher correlation at thebeginning and at the end of the period. This dynamism is evidence of hedge funds’ strate-gic and tactical allocation changes in response to an evolving macroeconomic scenario.While its correlation with bonds and equity changed dramatically, it remained positivethroughout the years. During this period hedge funds’ lowest correlation with bonds andequity was 35.07% and 19.74% respectively. Hoevenaars et al. (2008) report hedge fundsconsistent positive correlation with equity and bonds thought the period analyzed.As shown on Figure 1,CDI and commodities asset classes provide good diversiﬁcationto a portfolio with stocks and bonds. Both assets show signiﬁcant negative conditionalcorrelation with bonds and stock indexes. Commodity shows persistent negative corre-lation with equity and low to negative correlation with bonds. In contrast, CDI has lowto negative correlation with stocks, and persistent negative correlation with bonds due toduration mismatch.Hoevenaars et al. ﬁnd that commodities have the best diversiﬁcation beneﬁts amongthe assets they study.Our results show that hedge funds, mutual funds and listed real estate index whenadded to a traditional portfolio of equity and bonds do not add signiﬁcant diversiﬁca-tion beneﬁts. In contrast, the conditional correlation dynamics of CDI and commoditiesindicates that these assets add considerable diversiﬁcation beneﬁts to a bond and stockportfolio.20 Hoevenaars et al. (2008) ﬁnd similar diversiﬁcation beneﬁts results for the Americanalternative assets they analyzed. Hoevenaars et al. explain that commodities returnsare inherently diﬀerent from equities and bonds. Commodities futures contract returnsare not based on long-lived corporation expected results. Instead, commodity futurescontracts have an expiration day and are typically used as insurance for future values ofthe underlying commodity.To understand the diversiﬁcation impact of adding several

During the periodanalyzed, DB plans increase their investments in alternatives assets and listed real estateeven during the ﬂight to quality period. These allocation patterns are further evidencethat DB pension funds do not adopt LDI strategies. We ﬁnd that Brazilian listed realestate, stocks and short term interest do not provide eﬀective liabilities risks hedgingbeneﬁts to Brazilian DB pension funds. Thus, we question DB pension funds’ strategicallocation. Brazilian deﬁned beneﬁt pension funds should invest in assets that provideeﬀective liabilities risk management to ensure adequate funding ratio and minimize theirfunding ratio volatility.DC and VC pension funds are not liable to pay futures ﬁxed beneﬁts. Nevertheless,pension funds futures payments are exposed to inﬂation and real interest rate risks. It is28 in the best interest of a pension plan participant to have their future payments hedgedagainst these risks. Therefore, DC and VC funds should implement some LDI allocationstrategies as well.2.7Research Limitations and Directions for Future StudyIn this study, we derive the time-varying conditional correlation between seven assetsand two liabilities for insights into Brazilian alternative-assets’ diversiﬁcation and hedgingpotential. We analyzed monthly data from January 2008 to July 2018, which represents127 observations. While we have conﬁdence in the robustness of our results on account ofthe analyzed data’s wide range of economic conditions, selection of an econometric modelthat best ﬁts our data, and statistically signiﬁcant estimation results, there are a coupleof limitations in this study that are worth discussing.First, this study relies on the empirical analysis of the available data, which is lim-ited to 127 observations. The limited sample size has precluded subsamples analyzes.Furthermore, our results are based on the assumption that the time-varying conditionalcorrelation estimated from the data sample fairly represents the assets and liabilities dy-namics. If the data analyzed do not represent a good sample of the asset and liabilitiesrelationship, our conditional correlations estimates will not fully capture the assets andliabilities complex dynamic relationship.Second, the ﬁnancial modeling methods employed in this study do not allow us toderive causation relationships between the assets and liabilities. While we consider someeconomic rationale for the conditional correlations observed, we are mindful of the lim-itations of the methods employed with regards of establishing causation eﬀects betweeneconomic factors and the correlations between assets and liabilities.Our analysis of the beneﬁts of alternatives assets to asset-liability investors can beextended in several promising directions for future research. While we focus on the em-pirical dynamic conditional correlation between alternative assets and liabilities, it wouldbe valuable to understand the causal economic process that makes the correlation betweenassets and liabilities change over time. In addition, a study of temporal alternative assets’allocation changes on a dynamic optimal portfolio would provide insight into the causalrelationship between assets. Another extension would be to analyze the diversiﬁcationand hedging beneﬁts of actual real estate investments and the role that internationalalternative assets can play for an emerging market asset-liability investor.29 between the market portfolio and our liability driven portfolio. Therefore, we questionthe Brazilian pension funds strategic asset allocation. Brazilian pension funds, especiallythose under deﬁned beneﬁts plans, should adopt liability driven investment strategies tominimize their funding ratio volatility, thus ensuring adequate funding for future liabilities.", "3DIVERSIFICATION BENEFITS OF US AND BRAZIL-IAN REITS", "DIVERSIFICATION BENEFITS OF US ANDBRAZILIAN REITSABSTRACTWe study the dynamic diversiﬁcation beneﬁts of US and Brazilian

January, 4 2011 to October,26 2020.During the period analyzed, BR and US stocks-REITs’ correlation time series aremarked by high volatility. Thus, we ﬁnd that BR- and US-REITs diversiﬁcation beneﬁtschange signiﬁcantly over time. Fei, Ding e Deng (2010), Case, Yang e Yildirim (2010),and Huang e Zhong (2013) report similar results for US stocks-REIts’ correlation. These46 empirical results provide a strong homologation for econometric methods that estimateconditional (time-varying) parameters.During the sample period, the conditional correlation between B3’s IBrA and IFIXhas a range of more than57%,a n dac o eﬃcient of variation of0.49.W h i l e t h e c o r r e l a t i o nchanges over time, it stays below50%for most of the period examined. Therefore, we ﬁndthat BR-REITs provide low diversiﬁcation beneﬁts for a stocks and bonds portfolio.

However, their conclusion is based on a rather small sample size. A more extensivesample period shows signiﬁcant correlation changes over the years.Akinlana, Folorunso e Babatunde (2019) ﬁnd evidence for a constant (time-invariant)correlation between IBOV stock index and FTSE EPRA/NAREIT Brazilian REIT indexreturns. In contrast, we observe signiﬁcant conditional (time-variant) correlation in ourﬁtted VAR-DCCtMGARCH economic model results (Table 8) and empirical correlationresults (Fig. 5). Akinlana, Folorunso e Babatunde sample data are based on indicesquoted in diﬀerent currencies, which might have aﬀected their results. Also, these authorsanalyze MGARCH models with Normal distribution. Brazilian times series do not followan o r m a ld i s t r i b u t i o na se v i d e n c e db yt h eS h a p i r o - W i l kt e s t .For US stocks-REITs, we observe a persistent positive correlation and signiﬁcant vari-ance in time. Correlation levels are above50%during most of the sample period. Weconclude that US-REITs do not provide consistent diversiﬁcation beneﬁts.We observe persistent low levels of bonds-REITs’ conditional correlation for both coun-tries during the period analyzed. Therefore, REITs would provide a high diversiﬁcationbeneﬁt for a portfolio with high government bonds allocation.The VAR-DCCtMGARCH model results show that BR-REITs returns are dynami-cally correlated with stock and bond index returns, and US-REITs are dynamically cor-related with the bond index but follow a Granger’s causation relationship with stocks.Therefore, we examine the relationship between assets-REITs correlation levels and theassets’ market performance.To analyze the impact of tail returns on the correlation, we group the assets returnsand their respective correlation with REITs into groups and show the results on Fig. 6and Fig. 7. Table 9 shows the return limits of each group, as well as,P1andP3,which47 are the percentile levels of group 1 and 3 return limits.Table 9: Return limits for each group.Group 1 Group 2 Group 3Return limitsP1Return limits Return limitsP3Fig. 2IBrAri,t<=\u00007.5e-3 25%\u00007.5e-3<ri,t<8.5e-3ri,t>=8.5e-3 75%IMA-Gri,t<=\u00005.2e-4 25%\u00005.2e-4<ri,t<1.5e-3ri,t>=1.5e-3 75%DWCFTri,t<=\u00003.6e-3 25%\u00003.6e-3<ri,t<5.4e-3ri,t>=5.4e-3 75%SPUSBTri,t<=\u00001.1e-3 25%\u00001.1e-3<ri,t<1.2e-3ri,t>=1.2e-3 75%Fig. 3IBrAri,t<=\u00000.0225%\u00000.022<ri,t<0.021ri,t>=0.02195%IMA-Gri,t<=\u00003.0e-3 5%\u00003.0e-3<ri,t<3.6e-3ri,t>=3.6e-3 95%DWCFTri,t<=\u00000.0165%\u00000.016<ri,t<0.015ri,t>=0.01595%SPUSBTri,t<=\u00002.9e-3 5%\u00002.9e-3<ri,t<3.1e-3ri,t>=3.1e-3 95%This table reports returns levels from each group,P1is the left tail (group 1) percentile andP3is theright tail (group 3) percentile.Fig. 6 shows box-plots of BR- and US-correlation between REITs and stocks (top row)and bonds (lower row).

Furthermore, BR stocks-REITs’ groups 1 and 3 range are signif-icantly lower than group 2, suggesting extreme tail performance aﬀects the volatility ofconditional correlation between these assets.The results show some degree of REITs’ correlation sensitivity to stocks and bonds tailperformance. Nevertheless, the diversiﬁcation beneﬁt did not change signiﬁcantly due toextreme market movements. Therefore, we conclude that REITs diversiﬁcation beneﬁts50 are not dependent on stocks and bonds market performance.3.7ConclusionThis paper analyzes the diversiﬁcation beneﬁts and volatility proﬁle of Brazilian (BR)and US real estate investment trusts (REITs). We model REITs’ conditional correlationwith stock and government bond indices from each country. Our ﬁndings show that BR-and US-REITs diversiﬁcation performance and volatility proﬁle are remarkably similar.Our results show that BR- and US-REITs’ correlations with bonds and stocks changesigniﬁcantly over time. BR bonds-REITs’ correlation is persistently lower than 25%, andUS bonds-REITs’ correlation is negative for most of the sample period. Thus, BR- and US-REITs indices provide persistent diversiﬁcation beneﬁts for government bond investors.In contrast, the conditional correlation between stocks and REITs are marked by highvolatility and constant high correlation for both countries during most of the sampleperiod. Therefore, BR and US stock investors do not obtain persistent diversiﬁcationbeneﬁts investing in REITs.Our model results show that REITs index returns from both countries have a dynamicand complex relationship with stocks and bonds returns. BR-REITs are dynamicallycorrelated (bidirectional relationship) with stocks and bonds, and US-REITs are dynamiccorrelated with bonds, but not with socks. US-REITs returns have a unidirectional depen-dence relationship with US-stocks returns. Furthermore, US- and BR-REITs have similarvolatility proﬁles, bearing signiﬁcant ARCH eﬀect, GARCH eﬀect, and fast convergenceto long-term volatility levels.BR- and US-REITs correlation levels are not signiﬁcantly aﬀected by stocks and bondsmarket performances. Therefore, we ﬁnd no evidence that REITs’ diversiﬁcation variationis inﬂuenced by stocks and bonds market performance.Future research can expand this study in promising ways. While we focus our researchon the diversiﬁcation beneﬁts of BR- and US-REITs, it would be interesting to examineand compare the REITs’ performance of multiple developed and emerging countries. An-other contribution would be to compare the diversiﬁcation performance of diﬀerent REITs’sectors and types between countries.Our results provide relevant insights for REITs investors. Practitioner should employdynamic investment strategies that account for time variation in REITs diversiﬁcationbeneﬁts. BR and US long-term bonds investors, such as pension funds, would obtain51 signiﬁcant diversiﬁcation beneﬁts by investing in REITs. Brazilian bond investors wouldalso lower the short-term portfolio volatility by investing in BR-REITs.", "4EMERGING MARKET COMMODITY INVESTING:EVIDENCE FROM BRAZIL", "EMERGING MARKET COMMODITY INVESTING:EVIDENCE FROM BRAZILABSTRACTWe analyze the impact of two leading US-based commodity indices (Bloomberg Com-modity Index and S&P Goldman Sachs Commodity Index) on a Brazilian portfolio com-posed of stock index, government bond index, and inﬂation-linked government bond in-dex", " Our results show that international commodity indices provide inﬂation hedging andsigniﬁcant diversiﬁcation beneﬁts for Brazilian investors", " Our results have substantial sig-niﬁcance for Brazilian investors", " US commodity indices, such as BCI and SPGSCI, wouldeﬃciently complement the inﬂation-linked bond index in reducing the inﬂation risk of aBrazilian portfolio and provide adequate protection during market turbulence", "Keywords: Commodities, Inﬂation Hedge, Emerging Markets, Diversiﬁcation4", "1IntroductionEmerging markets investors face higher levels of short and long-term inﬂation riskthan their developed countries counterpart", " Moderate to high levels of inﬂation can sub-stantially erode current and future purchasing power", " Therefore, inﬂation is a signiﬁcantliability to many institutional and private investors, particularly long-term investors suchas pension funds", "Liabilities are not directly investable", " Thus, investors value assets that hedge againstliabilities risks and provides diversiﬁcation beneﬁts", " Commodity prices are set by a com-petitive, liquid, standardized global market and quoted in a common currency (BLOCH;DOCKERY;

From this current year’s market, Latin America (composed mostly by Brazil, Mexico, and Argentina) represented 4% or $7.2 billion dollars, which, in comparison to all remaini ng regions, showed the strongest advancements with an YoY (year on year) growth rate of 5.1% (Newzoo, 2021) . This growth show s the position that games have earned as the current largest entertainment market industry in the wor ld. Together, the global music industry, worth around $20 billion dollars, and the movie industry, worth around $42.5 billion dollars, are less than half the value of the videogame industry (Shawn, 2021) . However, similar to oth er segments, the effects of COVID -19 have deeply affected th e gaming business . This can be seen from the deterioration of work ties and changes in productivity caused by remote working (Waber & Munyikwa, 2021) alongside the disr uption of supply chains mainly influenced by the microchip crisis (Sweney, 2021) . As such, console game s and PC games were the most affected with an expected diminishment of -8.9% and -1.4% YoY respectively. In contrast, mobile games were the least affected showing an optimistic growth of 4.7% YoY.", "Similar to the general trend of games, eSports have also shown significant improvement. The market has grown from $957 million dollars in 2019 to $1.08 billion dollars in 2021 and is e xpected to reach $1.62 billion dollars by 2024 which translates to a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 11.1% (Newzoo, 2021) . Brazil does not lag behind . The eSports revenue market is composed by many sources such as sponso rships, media rights, publisher fees, merchandise, tickets for events, among others. As of this year, sponsorship has represented the foundation of the entire industry, generating $641 million dollars or 59% of the entire market (Newzoo, 2018) . In contrast, the effects of COVID -19 have negatively impacted revenue streams and deals. The cancellation of many in -person events such as the Brazilian CBLOL in 2020 (Rox, 2020) alongside market uncertainty pl aced many investments on stand -by, such as new sponsorship deals which decreased from 454 in 2019 to 358 in 2020 (Newzoo, 2021) and led to deal renegotiations within the industry such as licensing transmission fees (Global Data, 2020) . However, the scenario persists as optimal considering the increase in the number of renewed multi -year agreements (Newzoo, 2021) and the exponential popularity that eSports have earned dur ing this period which attracts the attention of sponsoring organizations (PWC, 2022) .", "In this context, Brazil and part of Latin America have shown optimal growth for the next years. Latin America is expected to present a $55.6 m illion dollars revenue stream by the end of 2021. From this total, 28% (the largest slice) comes from advertisement, which is contrary to the rest of the European and US scenarios. the Brazilian national esports market has also demonstrated relevant expans ion (Newzoo,", "2021) . It ranked as the 3rd country with most eSport enthusiasts (following China and the U.S.) (Newzoo, 2021) with an expected 12.6 million individuals by the end of 2021 (Newzoo, 2018) . Additionally, the overall growth of the national market can be perceived from new teams, new tournaments and overall viewership of tournaments, and other statistics.", "1.2 ACADEMIC RELEVANCE", "As the statistical information show s, the huge number of financial resources moving through sponsorships in eSports and its role as the foundation of the entire industry, mirrors the traits that sponsorship has had within the traditional sports context . Although sponsorship has been present in the world for over 100 years , it was only during the beginning of the 1970s that this practice became considerably more developed and shifted towards more commercial purposes (Meenaghan T. , 1998) especially in the conte xt of sports which currently still owns the highest percentage of sponsorships (Meenaghan T. , 2013) . This has led to a progressively larger field of studies examining sponsorship in the context of sports. In contrast to this scenario , the academic scenario of eSports has very few papers that have studied sponsorship even though its relevance is in par with that of traditional sports as previously addressed.", "Many of the studies within the literature of sport sponsorship have examined the effects of sponsorship on the sponsor’s brand equity (Cornwell, Roy, & Steinard, 2001; Donlan, 2013) , the effects of perceived fit for both the sport event and its sponsor (Becker - Olsen & Hill, 2006; Mazodier & Merunka, 2012) , purchase intention of a sponsor’s brand (Papadimitriou, Kaplanidou, & Papacharalampous, 2016; Cobb -Walgren, Ruble, & Donthu, 1995) , strategic objectives of a sponsorship (Cornwell & Maignan, 1998; Koo, Quarterman, & Flynn, 2006; Roy & Cornwell, 2003) , and the effects of credibility between the sponsor and sponsee (Rifon, Choi, Trimble, & Li, 2004; Wang, Cheng, Purwanto, & Erimurti, 2011) . Alongside this, many authors have also provided recommendations on further fields of research in sponsorship studies such as utilizing respondents outside the college scenario (Koo & Lee, 2019) and applying studies in different sports and country contexts (Wang, 2017) .", "While academic studies on sports have existed for some time , the academic scenario for eSports is relatively new. Academic studies have begun to address a variety of relevant themes concerning this new industry such as defini ng of what are eSports (Hamari & Sjöblom, 2017) ; whether eSports can be considered actual s ports (Hallmann & Giel, 2018; Cunningham, et al., 2018; Jenny, Manning, Keiper, & Olrich, 2016) ; certain negative behavior s of professional players and audience (Adinolf & Türkay, 2018; Kwak, Blackburn, & Han, 2015; Kou, 2020) ; ethical subjects concerning gambling (Sweeney, Tuttle, & Berg, 2019) , frauds (Holden & Ehrlich, 2017) , doping (Ghoshal, 2019) ; institutional organization and governance (Peng, Dickson, Scelles, Grix, & Brannagan, 2020; Holden, Rodenberg, & Kaburakis, 2017) ; the effects of eSport practice for the health of athletes and players (Yin, et al., 2020) ; the motives that drive eSport continuous use (Hamari & Sjöblom, 2017; Weiss & Schiele, 2013) and the distinction from traditional sports audiences (Cushen, Rife, & Wann, 2019; Pizzo, et al., 2018) , effects on consumers concerning identity and loyalty (Kordyaka, Jahn, & Niehaves, 2020) ; and the", "divergent experience of women in the scenario (Ruvalc aba, Shulze, Kim, Berzenski, & Otten, 2018) . In each of these subjects, however, the number of studies is very scarce which makes a large need and availability for further research (Funk, Pizzo, & Baker, In the realm of sponsorships, only a few studies have discussed it within the context of eSports. Among them, some examined the perceptions and responses of consumers towards non -endemic sponsors (Huettermann, Trail, Pizzo, & Stallone, 2020) , the benefits that sponsoring brands can obtain (Gawrysiak, Burton, Jenny, & Williams, 2020; Elasri -Ejjaberi, Rodriguez -Rodriguez, & Aparicio -Chueca, 2020) and restriction towards certain sponsoring brands (Chambers, 2020) .", "The present study ha d the goal of contributing to the literatu re by providing further knowledge about eSport sponsorship . The study investigate d the perspective of its consumers and focus ed on understanding which characteris tics from the individual spectator and the partnership between sponsor and event most contribute d to the value of the sponsoring brand and, furthermore, the intention of purchase of a sponsor’s products or services.", "1.3 MANAGERIAL RELEVANCE", "While the sponsor ship of traditional sport is a consolidated industry with long and established partnerships between companies and events , eSports consists of a new and popular field to engage with . The overall audience is of young er consumers of diverse backgrounds , engag e with (Duran, 2021) . Even countries’ governments are promoting the growth of this industry through improvement s on legislation (The Straits Times, 2021) and through the creation of national tourn aments (MENAFN, 2021) . However, it also involves considerable uncertainty regarding its structural elements (consumers, teams, events) since many investors don’t fully know the audience (Studholme, 2021 ) or if any applied investments will truly return in a reasonable timeframe (Duran, 2020) . In Brazil, eSports have demonstrated considerable success. As of 2021, the country is among the top 5 in the world concerning onlin e community size. Besides, its mobile gaming market holds the number 1 spot within all Latin America (Exame, 2021) . Many companies continuously form deals to sponsor events such as CBLOL (Isto É Dinheir o, 2021) and Free Fire World Series Rio (Garena Brasil, 2019) or even teams such as Vivo Keyd (Domingues, 2020) and MIRB (MKT Esportivo, 2021) . In fact, many traditional figures originally from the sport scenario have also migrated towards eSports. This is the case of famous sport teams such as Santos (Santos Futebol Clube, n.d.) and Cruzeiro (Cruzeiro Esporte Clube, n .d.) and companies such as Ka Bum! (KaBuM! Esports, n.d.) and Vivo (Vivo Keyd, 2022) who have started their own eSports teams . From the side of sponsorships, well known brands have also migrated tow ards this scenario which is the case of global brands like Coca -Cola and national brands like Submarino , official sponsors of paiN Gaming (A Crítica, 2021) and LOUD (Carbone, 2021) , respectively . Alongside companies from the financial segment that have also created their own tournaments (meio&mensagem, 2021) and events (Costa T. S., 2021) as a way to leverage themselves into the scenario.", "Overa ll, the eSports scenario represents a novelty since elements such as fans’ profile s, games played, teams, professional players, channels utilized, and their characteristics are all new and there is not much light shed on how similar or divergent some of th ese elements are in comparison to the traditional sports industry. The profile of esports fans is very diversified (demographics, games played) so many companies must rely on the service of consulting companies specialized in connecting brands with the gaming scenario (Druid Creative Gaming, n.d.) . The controlling power of game publishers of each eSport gives them the right to shape and influence many elements associated with their games including sponsor partnerships , which can lead to unilateral cancellations (Stubbs, 2020) . Although the knowledge of these and many other elements is crucial for investors and brands, the current study focuse d on examining the perspective of consumers concerning the val ue of sponsoring brands within the eSport event s in Brazil. This is considerably relevant since common objectives of sport sponsors include the enhancement of brand awareness (Cornwell, Roy, & Steinard, 2001) , brand image (Gwinner K. , 1997) , increase on sales alongside more engagement with the audiences (Gwinner & Swanson, 2003) .", "1.4 STUDY STRUCTURE", "The study was divided into 5 chapters as follows. The first chapt er was dedicated to present the objectives of the study, offer a brief introduction to the current scenario of the games and eSports’ industry, and explain the managerial and academic relevance of this study. In sequence, on chapter two, the study present ed the theoretical background of the following topics discussed in the sport sponsorship literature: the sponsor -event fit; brand authenticity ; the compulsive behavior of fans; sponsor’s overall brand equity ; and brand purchase intention . Following, chapter three present ed the main problem identified to be answered , the study’s questions objectives , the restricted scope the study focused on, the operationalization of the theory into constructs, characteristics of the population and sample, details about the collection instrument, tests performed to improve phrasings, the process of data collection to form the sample, details of the statistical analysis utilized and the new emergent conceptual that resulted from the initial analysis. Furthermore, chapter four present ed further details about the sample and the results from statistical tests performed, and chapter five present ed the conclusions reached , their implications for academic knowledge and field professionals , limitations of the study and suggestions for future researchers . Next, References and Appendix are located in the end of th e study.", "2 THEORETICAL BACKGROUND", "The goal of the study was to further expand the current knowledge of sponsorship within the scenario of sports and, more specifically, eSpo rts whose novelty inherits a wide range of challenges that are important not just to benefit itself, but also to improve future management decisions in broader sports context s (Cunningham, et al., 2018) . To address some problems and answer questions, the present study was organized by first introducing its theoretical basis, through the literature of each theory, followed by previous studies that appl ied the theories within their research of sport and sponsorship. The theoretical framework consist ed of three different groups of theories: Schema Theory and Associative Network Theory concerning Fit; Attribution Theory and Balance Theory underpinning Authenticity; Lastly, Social Identification, Compulsiveness and Fanaticism to cover Compulsive Sport Consumption.", "2.1 FIT", "Fit between a sponsor and an event is one of the most frequently studied constructs within the sponsorship literature (Deitz, Myers, & Stafford, 2012) , thus it was critically relevant within t he current study. Although the concept lacks a n established definition, some authors describe d it as a “strategic match between sponsoring firms and sponsored nonprofit service providers in mission, target audience, and/or values” (Becker -Olsen & Hill, 2006) ; from the consumer’s view as the perceived similarity shared by sponsor and sponsored figure s (Weeks, Humphreys, & Cornwell, 2018) and, as compared to celebrity endorsement, “the perceived match (o r mismatch) of brand attributes with the endorser’s attributes influences consumer response to such marketing communications” (McDaniel, 1999) . In a broad sense, these definitions propose that interacting brands share meanings with each other (Gwinner K. , 1997) and as these meanings become sturdier in the person’s mind , their fit progressively improves (Drengner, Jahn, & Zanger, 2011) . One of the most referenced theorie s to sustain fit is the s chema theory . A schema is described briefly as a “preexisting assumption about the way the world is organized” (Singer, 1968) . It is also described as “a mechanism to allow individuals to function in a complex environment. […] That is, one is able to simply recall knowledge related to the general type of situation, person, or object” (Gwinner & Eaton, 1999) . As such, the theory suggests that individuals organize their expe riences based on the similarities with a certain schema ( e.g., brands, event sponsors) which facilitates recalling (Deitz, Myers, & Stafford, 2012) . In the case of sponsorships, consumers carry already established conceptions about products or brands and the categories they belong to within a sponsored event (Drengner, Jahn, & Zanger, 2011) . As new messages or ideas are transmitted by brands, those considered associated with a given schema are promptly accepted while the remaining end up forgotten in the person’s mind (Koo, Quarterman, & Flynn, 2006) . However, if this new information cannot be properly associated, the individual searches for another adequate scheme , which le ads to the adap tation of both the information and the schema (Axelrod, 1973) .", "Associative Network studies how memory operates. The theory proposes that memory is composed of singular pieces of information named nodes which are l inked together with ties that may variate in strength (Collins & Loftus, 1975) . Accumulated information held by an individual is retrieved through a process known as “activation”. Basically, the information about a certain subje ct is instigated when a node is triggered from memory. From this initial trigger, the process of “Spreading Activation” takes place, where one set of nodes leads into thinking about another set until a concept is reforged in the memory (Anderson, 1983) .", "While Associative Network theory proposes that stimulation from a certain set of memories of, for example an event, can instigate a logical recall towards other connected sets like a brand, Schema theory consists o f consumers established and categorized thoughts about brands and how well they combine within a sponsorship context (Smith G. , 2004) . Independently of which theory is chosen , the main purpose of their application is to help explain the effe ct that a perceived fit between a sponsor and a sponsored entity has on spectators/consumers responses.", "The literature has shown that a sponsor that maintains a strong fit with a respective event has the capacity to enhance its brand image (Gwinner K. , 1997) – through functional or image based associations (Gwinner & Eaton, 1999) , brand recognition (Koo, Quarterman, & Flynn, 2006) , brand attitude (Koo & Lee, 2019; Speed & Thompson, 2000) , brand equity (Wang, Cheng, Purwanto, & Erimurti, 2011) and other more broad responses towards the brand (Deitz, Myers, & Stafford, 2012) within the mind of the consumers. In certain instances, sponsor’s brands already present a natural fit with the event within consumer’s schemas and thus may yield these positive results more easily. In other cases, the relationship might not be sustained by the weak pre -existing consumer’s schema and must be leveraged through marketing efforts (Rogers, Farquhar, Moreover, other research highlights the relevance that fit possesses in developing many of the elemen ts within the framework of consumer -based brand equity such as awareness and brand image which compose brand knowledge, a firms most important asset for building brand equity (Keller, 1993) .", "These findings suggest that fans who maintain more positive thoughts about sport events develop stronger mental schemas which extend towards other elements that characterize the event, including the sponsoring brands. As such, the first hypothesis formulated is:", "H1: Sponsor -event fit has a positive impact on sponsor’s overall brand equity.", "2.2 BRAND AUTHENTICITY", "Authenticity has been a relevant construct examined in a variety of research fields such as Consumer Behavior (Grayson & Martinec, 2004) Brand Extension s (Spiggle, Nguyen, & Caravella, 2012) and Celebrity Endorsement (Moulard, Garrity, & Rice, 2015) which show ed the recurring relevance of the subject. Within the sport sponsorship", "literature, the construct has been mostly examined under the credibility construct . As such, credibility can be defined as a honest (Koo & Lee, 2019) and trustable (Wang, Cheng, Purwanto, & Erimurti, 2011) image that companie s desire to create through the sponsoring of projects (Rifon, Choi, Trimble, & Li, 2004) . Additionally, it is worth noting that authenticity distinguishes itself from fit. The verification of fit demands one to compare the chara cteristics of each brand for signs of similarity, while an examination of authenticity focuses more on the relationship between the partners and its perception from the sight of consumers (Charlton & Cornwell, 2019) .", "Balanc e Theory affirms that people prioritize equilibrium for their lifestyles. The theory considers the connections between objects or thoughts that an individual may determine to belong together, linked by some sort of similarity or proximity (Heider, 1958) . Thus, people perceive two objects as being similar when the ideas or conceptions associated with them are positive and , in parallel, perceive them as dissimilar when these conceptions are negative (Heider, 1958) . In sports, spectators desire symmetry between the linked elements within a sponsorship relationship (Dean, 2002) . Thus , the consumer may have positive point s of view towards the sponsor and the even t, but, as he strives for equilibrium in his perception s and attitude s, it will only be attained if the bonds shared are also positive (Ruth & Strizhakova, 2012) .", "Research in the field of psychology have shown that it is through the pr ocess of attribution that an equilibrium between individuals and their attitudes can be reached (Ruth & Strizhakova, 2012) . As such, Attribution Theory proposes that individuals are “naïve scientists” that try to establish causal inferences about any event that is either lived or observed (Heider, 1958; Kelley, 1973) . These inferences or attributions allow the individual s to develop a better understanding , control and prediction of events and behaviors taking place around them (Scheinbaum, Lacey, & Liang, 2017; Deitz, Myers, & Stafford, 2012; Rifon, Choi, Trimble, & Li, 2004) which provides support for personal future choices or course s of actio n (Kelley, 1973) .", "These inferences created by i ndividuals are shown to depend on (1) information that is available in their surrounding context and (2) the different types of factors that mold an attribution which are separated in (a) personal factors (intrinsic motivation) and (b) situational factors (extrinsic motivation) (Heider, 1958) . According to the Discounting Principle, conceived attributions made by individuals can be replaced whenever a plausible alternative explanation presents itself (Kelley, 1973) . As a result , personal inferences are much more easily discarded when situational and comprehensible explainers are present (Rifon, Choi, Tr imble, & Li, 2004) . In the context of sports, for example, the audience of an event will develop their own inferences as to the reasons behind a sponsorship by a certain brand (Scheinbaum, Lacey, & Liang, 2017) and assign either noble or doubtful reasons for those sponsors, which are expected to influence spectators course of action and affect the sponsor’s credibility and image (Dean, 2002; Rifon, Choi, Trimble, & Li, 2004) The overall studies of brand authenticity have demonstrated that event spectators do come up with possible motivations for the reason s behind a sponsor’s presence within an event (Dean, 2002) which occurs with or without supportive mar keting communications (Rifon, Choi, Trimble, & Li, 2004) . As a result, event consumers altruistic attributions towards sponsor’s motives generate many effects to the brands such", "as awareness and image (Meenaghan T. , 2001; Rifon, Choi, Trimble, & Li, 2004; Dean, 2002) , attitude towards it (Dean, 2002; Ruth & Strizhakova, 2012; Ruth & Simonin, 2006; Scheinbaum, Lacey, & Liang, 2017) and purchase intention (Ruth & Strizhakova, 2012; Scheinbaum, Lacey, & Liang, 2017; Meenaghan T. , 2001) . Consequently, sponsors whose motives are identified by consumers to be m ost financially driven or focused on self-benefits may generate opposite results to the gains previously mentioned (Rifon, Choi, Trimble, & Li, 2004; Ruth & Strizhakova, 2012) .", "The primary studies of brand equity e mphasize effects that are generated from the associations between a brand and another entity. As the shared connections are maintained over time, they become stronger and eventually result in deeper and more meaningful results such as attitude or credibili ty (Keller, 1993) which are essential element s for a brand to create and develop its image (Aaker, 1991) .", "These findings suggest that since fans maintain a judgmental perspective towards the reasons behind a sponsorship, a sponsor that is perceived as possessing legitimate and altruistic motives will be better accepted and valued by the audience. As such, t he second hypothesis formulated is:", "H2: Brand Authenticity has a positive impact on sponsor’s overall brand equity", "2.3 COMPULSIVE SPORT CONSUMPTION", "Concerning the psychological mechanisms that motivate an individual’s involvement with certain elements or figures in sports, the most prominent theory in the sport literature is Social Identity Theory. I t proposes that individuals seek to positively define and distinguish themselves through their membership with a social group, motivated by a need to enhance self -esteem (Tajfel & Turner, 1979) which can vary depending on outcome of a sport event (Ashforth & Mael, 1989) which can be positive in the case of success – Bask in the Reflected Glory (Cialdini, et al., 1976) – or negative in the case of failure – Cutting the Reflected Failure (Snyder, Lassegard, & Ford, 1986). However, the behaviors of fans and th eir motivators are complex in the studies of sport consumption (Campbell, Aiken, & Kent, 2004). For instance, certain fans positively identified with a certain sport’s team have demonstrated negative responses of aggression towards groups of people related or not to that situation (Wann, 1993). Although such behavior exists because of a fan’s identification with a team, the type of response is not associated with the intensity of this relationship, but rather the fan’s own dysfunctional characteristics (Wak efield & Wann, 2006).", "One field of psychology that has examin ed this aspect is the literature of sport fanaticism. Fanaticism may be defined as “the degree of intensity to which one is a fan, with the level of involvement varying from low to high intensity ” (Thorne & Thorne, 2006). Literature suggest s that, within a specter of fan classifications, there is the dysfunctional type, which is considered the most serious since sports, in his case, are vital for self -identification and affect his behaviors reflec ted by responses of hysteria and violence (Hunt, Bristol, & Bashaw, 1999; Thorne & Thorne, 2006), bullying (Courtney", "& Wann, 2010) and rumination (Kim & Byon, 2020) which may also extend towards behaviors regarding consumption.", "The literature defines Consu mption as “repetitive and seemingly purposeful behaviors that are performed according to certain rules or in a stereotyped fashion” (American Psychiatric Association, 1985). Compulsive consumption takes the form of “a consumer’s tendency to be preoccupied with buying that is revealed through repetitive behavior and a lack of impulse control” (Ridgway, Kukar -Kinney, & Monroe, 2008) and it distinguishes itself from its “normal” counterpart based on the motivations for the engagement and the resulting conseque nces (O'Guinn & Faber, 1989). It is considered both an impulse -control disorder, since there is a lack of control over the desire to consume objects, and an obsessive -compulsive disorder, since the behavior is repetitively performed to diminish negative fe elings (Ridgway, Kukar -Kinney, & Monroe, 2008; McElroy, Phillips, & Keck, 1994).", "Additionally, CBBE theory suggests that customers ’ relationship with a brand is reflected through their loyalty towards it which can be measured by how much relevance it has t o them where they can be totally indifferent towards it or, on the other side, fully committed to it (Aaker, 1991) . Higher brand loyalty can be characterized by a habit of frequent purchase which originates from a consumer who developed a strong attitude towards that brand (Keller, 1993) .", "From the literatures presented above, it is possible to conclude that certain individuals possess or develop dysfunctional characteristics during their lives. These characteristics may affect their relationships and behaviors towards people, objects or figures they interact with if that person has at least some level of engagement or identification with it. Among many possible behaviors, the compulsion to purchase or consume a product/service is an example related to inane dysfunctional traits of the person.", "Although no previous research has examined the theme, the article proposes that an eSports fan that demonstrates a certain level of identification towards the even t and is shown to suffer from dysfunctional consumption characteristics towards the game may rub off this behavior towards the associated sponsors, improving the value perception of that sponsor and leading to similar dysfunctional intentions to purchase s ponsors products. Thus, the third hypothesis formulated is :", "H3: Compulsive tendencies of a dysfunctional fan has a positive effect on sponsor’s overall brand equity.", "2.4 CONSUMER BASED BRAND EQUITY (CBBE) The literature concerning Brand Equity possesses a rather robust amount of contributions , which has also led to considerable segmentation of opinions concerning its definition (Christodoulides & de Chernatony, 2010) besides other issues such as the lack of solid measurement metho ds (Yoo & Donthu, 2001) . Still, authors define Brand Equity “as a set of brand assets and liabilities linked to a brand, its name and symbol, that add to", "or subtract from the value provided by a product or service to a firm and/ or that firm’s customer” (Aaker, 1991) . In other words, brand equity concerns “the marketing effects uniquely attributable to the brand” (Keller, 1993) or “consumers' different response between a foc al brand and an unbranded product when both have the same level of marketing stimuli and product attributes” (Yoo & Donthu, 2001) which “enables a brand to earn greater volume or greater margins than it could without the brand n ame and, in addition, provides a strong, sustainable and differential advantage ” (Srivastava & Schocker, 1991) that would not occur if the product or service did not have that brand Similar to the previous definition of Brand Equity, Customer -based Brand Equity is defined as “the differential effect of brand knowledge on consumer response to the marketing of the brand” (Keller, 1993) . The two standard methods to measure CBBE are the direct and indirect. The first one (direct approach) consists o f verifying what traits in the brand knowledge held by consumers can distinctively affect a company’s marketing program. The second one (indirect approach) examines the many elements that compose brand knowledge and attempts to identify which of those contributed with creating brand equity (Keller, 1993) .", "Conceptualized according to an associative network model from the consumer psychology per spective, brand knowledge is “the knowledge that has been created about the brand in consumers' mind” becoming a great source of marketing advantage (Keller, 1993) . It is defined in terms of two components: brand awareness and b rand image . Brand Awareness consists o f “the consumer’s ability to associate a brand to a product through an existing link between them ”. “Brand Image are the group of associations organized following a significant purpose ”. Brand associations are “all the content held by consumers in their memories that links them and gives value to a brand ” (Aaker, 1991) . Brand Associations may be characterized into three categories : attributes , benefits, and attitudes . Associations may be of primary nature in which these three categories are directly linked to the brand, or they may be of secondary nature in a way that they are transferred through the usage of another entity (Keller, 1993) . Secondary associations originate from links that can be established to, for example, a company, a celebrity or even an event as to connect them more easily to the brand. In the case of an event, when a link is established ( i.e., through a sponsorship deal) some associations may indirectly relate to the brand such as slogan, symbol or anything that can be related Accordingly, in the context of event and sport sponsorship, the associations formed between both entities and the positive enhancements brought to the sponsor’s brand awareness and brand image are one of the main goals of a sport -event partnership shown by the literature (Cornwell T. B., 199 5; Gwinner K. , 1997; Deitz, Myers, & Stafford, 2012; Wang, 2017; Koo & Lee, 2019) . A few studies on sponsorship apply CBBE to emphasize the differing benefits achieved by high and low equity brands on sponsor deals (Donlan, 2013; Roy & Cornwell, 2003) , while most examine brand equity as an outcome of a variety of antecedents such as fit and credibility (Amorim & Almeida, 2015; Coelho, de Amorim, & de Almeida, 20 19; Becker -Olsen & Hill, 2006; Wang, 2017) . This reinforces how these, and other objectives of event sponsorship overlap extensively with elements of brand equity (Cornwell, Roy, & Steinard, 2001) .", "2.5 PURCHASE INTENTION", "Cons idering the abstract characteristics of brands, one of the goals of research was to attribute measurable indicators for the equity of a brand which led to two main categories developed within the literature: the first one focus ing on consumers’ cognition and affection – awareness, image – and the second involv ing their behaviors – loyalty, willingness to pay (Cobb -Walgren, Ruble, & Donthu, 1995) . It is through the optimal success of indicators from consumers’ cognition (awareness and image) that favorable results occur in indicators of consumers’ behavior (i.e. , brand loyalty) which translates into a routine behavior of purchasing the brands ’ products or services (Keller, 1993; Brand attitudes are important for the understanding of purchase intention since attitudes are “a learned predisposition to respond in a consistently favorable or unfavorable manner with respect to a given object” (Fishbein & Ajz en, 1975) and a “relatively enduring, unidimensional summary evaluation of the brand that presumably energizes behavior”. Thus, it is through these favorable evaluations that behavioral intentions are defined which positively pump consumer behavior (Keller, 1993) . It is relevant to emphasize the distinction between attitudes, purchase intention and purchase behavior. Both attitude and intention are demonstrated to be separate, but correlated dimensions (Spears & Singh, 2004) . Additionally, purchase intentions need to be distinguished from actual purchase behaviors. The former i nstigates thoughts and plans that precede and instigate the latter (Dees, Bennett, & Villegas, 2008) . This way, purchase intention takes the role of a previous step before the actual purchase (Fishbein & Ajzen, Past literature demonstrates how many of the elements that compose CBBE are relevant antecedents to consumer’s purchase intention. These findings suggest that the more fans value the brands sponsoring the sport event, the stronger the willingness to purchase those sponsors’ products is going to be . Thus, the fourth hypothesis formulated is:", "H4: Sponso r’s overall brand equity has a positive impact on consumer’s purchase intention of sponsor’s products.", "2.6 ENDEMIC AND NON -ENDEMIC SPONSORSHIP", "One relevant aspect in the current study of sponsorships in eSport was the concept of endemic and non -endemic spons ors. Within the eSport scenario, endemic sponsors are classified as businesses native to eSports because their products/services are associated with a market, whereas non -endemic sponsors are businesses external to eSports since their products/services are not associated with the market. (Rogers, Farquhar, & Mummert, 2020; Huettermann, Trail, Pizzo, & Stallone, 2020) . The literature on eSports sponsorship has demonstrated that the characteristics of a sponsor as either e ndemic or non-endemic are related to some effects discussed in traditional sport literature.", "First, eSports fans perceive endemic sponsors as more naturally fitting participants on the event scenario than non -endemic sponsors and, thus, h old more positive attitudes towards endemic sponsors (Rogers, Farquhar, & Mummert, 2020) . Additionally, sponsor credibility is another important association that sponsors need to consider since eSports consumers present higher demands for authen ticity from sponsors (Pizzo, Jones, & Funk, 2019) and perceive non -endemic sponsors with more skepticism than endemic ones (Rogers, Farquhar, & Mummert, 2020; Huettermann, Trail, Pizzo, & Stal lone, 2020) . Finally, identification and motivations shared between traditional sports and eSports fans are remarkably similar (Cushen, Rife, & Wann, 2019) , as such the effects of fan identification towards sponsors on tr aditional sports were expected to be similar in eSports, including the characteristics of dysfunctional fans and the effects of compulsive tendencies.", "These findings suggest that if a brand is endemically related to the sponsored sport, it will more easil y establish connections with it, be more positively perceived by the fan and form stronger bonds . Thus, the next hypotheses formulated are:", "H5a: The endemic nature of a sponsor ship positively moderates the relationship between Sponsor -event Fit and the sp onsor’s overall brand equity.", "H5b: The endemic nature of a sponsorship positively moderates the relationship between Brand Authenticity and the sponsor’s overall brand equity.", "H5c: The endemic nature of a sponsorship positively moderates the relationship between compulsive tendencies and the sponsor’s overall brand equity.", "2.7 CONCEPTUAL MODEL Based on the previously mentioned research questions and the proposed relationships, a conceptual model was developed (see Figure 1).", "Figure 1 – Original Conceptual Model", "3 METHOD", "3.1 RESEARCH PROBLEM", "The current study ha s the objective to further complement the body of knowledge regarding the business of eSports through the study of the ele ments that may influence the value of a sponsoring brand in an eSport event and the future intention to purchase its products . These elements are the perceptions of fit between the event and the sponsoring brand, the perception of authenticity in the relat ionships between the event and the sponsoring brand, and the individual compulsive traits present or absent within fans. An extensive library of studies within the literature of sport sponsorship ha d already examined the effects of fit between a sponsor an d an sport event (Speed & Thompson, 2000; Koo, Quarterman, & Flynn, 2006; Wang, 2017) , the effects of authenticity behind a sponsor’s motives for sponsoring an event (Rifon, Choi, Trimble, & Li, 2004; Wang, Cheng, Purwanto, & Erimurti, 2011; Koo & Lee, 2019) , the compulsive/dysfunctional characteristic s and behaviors of sport’s fans (Wann, 1993; Wakefield & Wa nn, 2006; Courtney & Wann, 2010) , the impact of a sponsor’s brand equity on a sport sponsorship (Cornwell, Roy, & Steinard, 2001; Roy & Cornwell, 2003) and fans purchase intention of event sponsor’s products (Madrigal, 2001; Dees, Bennett, & Villegas, 2008; Papadimitriou, Kaplanidou, & Papacharalampous, 2016) . In contrast to this fact, most of these studies had traditional sports as the ir object of study. Paral lel to this, few studies have examined the relationship between the eSport s audience and eSport s event sponsors (Huettermann, Trail, Pizzo, & Stallone, 2020; Rogers, Farquhar, & Mummert, 2020) . Moreover, the study of co mpulsive/dysfunctional fans on the sports scenario was also slim (Wakefield & Wann, 2006; Courtney & Wann, 2010) and, so far, no studies have empirically examined the effects of this type of fan within the context of eSports sponsorship. Lastly, most sports sponsorship studies have been conducted in developed countries (Wang, Cheng, Purwanto, & Erimurti, 2011) when compared to those performed in developing countries. All these elements are novelties and sustain the relevance of this study for the literature.", "3.2 STUDY’S OBJECTIVES", "The objectives of this study are as follows : Verify if (and to what extent) the perceived fit between the sponsor and sponsored eSport event, the perceived authent icity of the sponsoring brand with the event and the compulsive profile of the fan influence positively the audience’s perception of the sponsor’s brand and, consequently, their intent ion to purchase its products. This objective was segmented into five separate objectives :", "(1) Does perceived Fit between sponsor and event positively affect the sponsor’s overall brand equity?", "(2) Does perceived Authenticity of the sponsoring brand positively affect the sponsor’s overall brand equity?", "(3) Do compulsive tendenc ies of fans positively affect the sponsor’s overall brand equity?", "(4) Does a sponsor’s overall brand equity positively affect the purchase intention of its products ?", "(5) Can the endemic or non -endemic nature of a sponsor affect the relationship between the sponsor’s overall brand equity and (a) sponsor -event fit; (b) authenticity of the sponsoring brand; and (c) compulsive tendencies of eSport fans?", "3.3 STUDY’S SCOPE", "In order to establish a domain to this study, League of Legends (LOL) game was chosen . This w as due to its traits as the current most popular game and eSport worldwide with 580 million hours watched during the course of 2020 (Borisov, 2021) , besides being the most popular eSport tournament with average viewership of 1. 11 million viewers and peak viewership of 139 million hours watched (Belous, 2020) .", "Since the study was performed in the Brazilian scenario, the only respondents chosen were self-declared Brazilian LOL eSport fans who either pla yed and watched content concerning the game or exclusively watched content without being a player. The chosen event for this research was the League of Legends Brazilian Championship (CBLOL) . This was done for a few reasons: (a) It was one of the most relevant L eague of Legends event s in Brazil , having reached peak viewership of 207.9 K during the first split in its 2020 edition (Yakimenko, 2020) ; (b) The event sponsors were composed of well-known brands : Dell, Red Bull , Masterc ard, Gillette and KitKat (meio&mensagem, 2021) which was essential for one of the study’s objective of examin ing the mediating effect that this may cause. All examined brands have formed rather recent partnerships as sponsors of the event with the first one being Gille tte who initiated its relationship with the event in 2018 (Ganiko, 2018) . Many authors have demonstrated that longer periods of sponsorship yield greater image (Gwinner K. , 1997) and commitment (Ruth & Strizhakova, 2012) , while some authors reinforce d that periods up to ten years may be necessary to grasp the most of these effects (Meenaghan J. A.,", "3.4 OPERATIONALIZATION OF CONSTRUCTS", "The conceptual model present ed three types of variables: (a) dependent, (b) independent, and (c) moderator.", "Fit, Brand Authenticity, and Compulsive Sport Consumption (CSC) were the three independent variables in t his study. Overall Brand Equity act ed simultaneously as a dependent variable of Fit, Brand Authenticity, and Compulsive Sport Consumption (CSC) and as an independent variable to Purchase Intention. Purchase Intention was the second dependent variable to the Overall Brand Equity. The endemic/non -endemic characteristics of the sponsoring brand serve d as moderating variables in the relationships", "between Fit and Overall Brand Equity, Brand Authenticity and Overall Brand Equity, Compulsive Sport Consumption (CSC ) and Overall Brand Equity.", "The five operationalized constructs were (a) the perceived fit between the sponsor and event, (b) the perceived authenticity of the sponsoring brand, (c) the compulsive traits of the fan, (d) the sponsor’s overall brand equity a nd (e) the purchase intention of sponsor’s brands.", "For the assessment of the sponsor -event fit construct, this study utilize d The Sponsor -Event Fit scale conceived by Speed & Thompson (2000) , composed of five items, and adapted by Amorim & Almeida (2015) , which use d multiple item Linkert scales to measure fit . Additionally, the author have translated the scale to Portuguese and applied it in Brazil, thus avoiding the necessary process o f translation. The sponsor’s brand authenticity construct was examined by applying the Horizontal Marketing Partnership Authenticity scale (HMP -Authenticity) composed of four items and adapted by Charlton & Cornwell (2019) from the Perceived Brand Authenticity scale (PBA) developed by Morhart et al. (2015) . While the latter examine d a single brand, the former focuse d on the authenticity between brands.

(2018) , composed of six items. Both this and the HMP -Authenticity scale ha d not been translated nor used in Brazil previously, thus, it was necessary to perform Portuguese translation and back - translations processes.", "Two pre -tests were performed in order to guarantee the best possible understanding for respondents. For the sponsor’s consumer -based brand equity, this study applie d the Overall Brand Equity (OBE) scale by Yoo & Donthu (2001) , composed of four items, as it was considered to be the most efficient created so far (Christodoulides & de Chernatony, 2010) . Lastly, purchase intention of sponsors products was measured through three variables proposed by Ohanian (1991) . Both this and the OBE scales had already been applied within the Brazilian context (Costa & Almeida, 2012; Düsenberg, Almeida, & Amorim, 2016) , thus making it unnecessary to perform translation and back - translation processes . Additionally, the adapted OBE scale developed by Amorim & Almeida (2015) cover ed the issue of product and service -focused question s since t he original version is product -focused and some of the sponsors studied were also service providers.", "The endemic or non -endemic characteristics of the sponsoring brand (endemic or non-endemic) were the single dichotomic variable operationalized to serve a s the moderating variable of the present study.", "3.5 POPULATION AND SAMPLE The population of the study are Brazilian eSport spectators who ha d watched the League of Legends Brazilian championship (CBLOL) 2021 and/or its last 2 editions", "(2019 and 2020) and were able to recall one of the five sponsors of the event and were qualifiable consumers of the brands (above 18 years old). Regarding the characteristics of the sample, no filters were applied in regard to economic conditions nor levels of instruction. The m ethod of collection was a random sample of respondents.", "To achieve this pre -defined type of spectator, four filter questions were present in the questionnaire: (a) degree of engagement with the eSport, (b) habits of watching live or recorded contents of th e game, (c) having watched at least one the last three CBLOL tournaments, (d) successfully recalling at least one of the sponsors of the event, € having over 18 years old. The degree of engagement with the game and the habits of watching live and recorded games were used to make sure the respondents ha d sufficient interactions with the game to be considered consumers. Having watched at least one of the last three tournaments translate d into a minimum level of involvement with the event. Recalling correctly at least one sponsor translate d into a minimum level of engagement to the sponsoring brand. The minimum age of eighteen years serve d as a proxy to an economically active and a viable intention of buying sponsor’s products and services.", "3.6 DATA COLLECTION IN STRUMENT", "The main instrument for data gathering was a web questionnaire composed of six segments.

On all app lications, the author made a brief introduction about himself, the overall theme of the research and an overall summary of the questionnaire’s sections. It was requested from all respondents to inform any doubts and provide feedback on the questionnaire for further improvement. From the participating respondents, two had to be discarded, because their profile did not pass the filtering question s section, which left the pre-testing with the minimum requirement of five successful applications.", "3.6.2 Phrasing Adaptations", "From the insights provided by respondents, comprehension and interpretation issues were identified within the back -translated phrases from the short HMP - Authenticity scale. Three out of five respondents did not fully comprehend the term “tendência s” in question 13 – A parceria entre o CBLOL e a “marca” resiste a tendências – and two out of five respondents also did not fully comprehend the term “justa” in question 14 – A parceria entre o CBLOL e a “marca” é justa. Additionally, the 2 remaining phra ses from questions 15 – “A parceria entre o evento e a marca engaja os fãs” - and question 16 – “A parceria entre o evento e a marca une os fãs com o que realmente importa” – were also changed since they did not transmit the intended meaning described by t he original author. As such, the following changes were applied:  Question 13 was adapted into “A parceria entre o CBLOL e a marca X pode ser duradoura, pois é capaz de sobreviver aos modismos”;  Question 14 was adapted into “A parceria entre o CBLOL e a m arca X é justa, pois reforça a credibilidade.”  Question 15 was changed to “A parceria entre o CBLOL e a marca X contribui para o fortalecimento dos valores da comunidade”  Question 16 was rewritten to “A parceria entre o CBLOL e a marca X fortalece valores compartilhados que são importantes para os fãs”.", "After obtaining these first five insights, the questionnaire was reproduced in the online web format. The questionnaire was developed using the SurveyMonkey application tool.

To guarantee that key questions would be answered, a function was utilized to make all answers obligatory except for the last one which concern ed the voluntary e -mail. Moreov er, the logic function was used to create a customized connection between Question 5 and all the phrases in the second segment of the survey. Questions 5 asked respondents to inform the name of the sponsor they recalled . With the logic function, the answer provided in Question 5 – sponsor name - became a part of the text on all the questions in the survey’s second segment. If all answers met the filtering requirements, the respondent was sent to the second segment. Otherwise, he was sent to the last page with the optional e -mail provision.

As such, some observations were made which were used to improve the questionnaire. In question 5 – “Por favor, escolha e informe o nome de 1 (uma) das marcas patrocinadoras que você lembrou.” – four respondents emphasized that they were not able to complete the questionnaire, because they did not remember the name of a sponsor and could not fill this section. The question was unable t o be removed or altered since it work ed as a custom field that mold ed all the scale questions in section two. From this feedback, a change was made so that, if respondents le ft the section empty, a message appear ed asking them to fill the answer with the n umber “0” .

The author entered in a variety of Discord communities (known as Servers) focused on Leagu e of Legends such as “Runeterra – BR”, “League of Divas”, “Taverna da Akali” . Within the servers, the author reached out to members individually to introduce himself, the research and ask ed for their cooperation through participation and by sharing the que stionnaire to colleagues . Additionally, the author contacted the servers’ moderators to help disclose the research publicly in the server’s channels.", "Another method used was Twitch, a video streaming platform focused on a variety of contents, but mostly on videogame s. The author searched for streamers whose content included League of Legends and directly messaged them through the site (or other social media platforms) asking them to participate in the survey and also to share the questionnaire with his or h er channel followers and personal colleagues. The third method was traditional social media channels such as Facebook and Twitter. On the first two channels, the author looked for League of Legend themed groups with relevance (number of members, likes and shares) and contacted its administrators and moderators to receive authorization to disclose the research questionnaires within the groups. On Facebook, the author received permission and disclosed the research in three", "groups: “Ilha de Freljord”, “League of Divas” and “League of Legends UFRJ”. On Twitter, the researcher used his own account to communicate about the research and invite possible participants to respond . The communication was aided by relevant figures from the scenario who retweeted the autho r’s tweet. This generated an engagement that led to a total of 48 responses.", "The last method applied was communication tools such as E -mail and WhatsApp . The author attempted an e-mail contact with eSports athletes and other professionals from the field by pre-recording a video presenting himself, the research theme and inviting them for a conversation. This method yielded very few responses , however some of the professional s who responded provided help in sharing the research through their social media cha nnels. In Whats App, the author searched and became part of a variety of League of Legends’ groups: “League of Legends Brasil”, “League of Legends BR”, “League of Yordles” among others. Similar to Discord, the author reached out individually to group member s and asked for their cooperation in answering the survey and sharing it with colleagues. The author also reached to the groups administrators and asked for permission to disclose the research in each group. The research was successfully disclosed in all o f them.", "3.8 DATA PRIVACY", "During the development of this study, the researcher and advisor needed to handle all respondent’s questionnaires which included information such as gender, age, e -mail address and device IP address , which are unique identification numbers of the user’s electronic devices . Since these types of data are considered sensitive, it was necessary to treat them properly as to avoid risks of leakage. As such, all regist rations of respondents’ personal data have been erased from researcher’ s and advisor’ s electronic devices. No information has been kept in any type of cloud platform except for the servers of the software used to create the questionnaire (SurveyMonkey ). The company maintains tight control and abides to the same legislation s concerning data privacy. This was done all in accordance with the Brazilian General Law of Data Protection (LGPD) and the requirements of the Research’s Ethic Committee (Comitê de Ética em Pesquisa – CEP).", "3.9 DATA ANALYSIS", "A total of 1,137 responses were colle cted through the web survey. From these responses, only 440 attended the required filter criteria described previously. The full data collection period was five months from September 2021 to January 2022. The main tools utilized to perform the statistics a nd models w ere the IBM SPSS ver. 26 and the IBM AMOS ver. 26. The overall analysis consisted of a Descriptive Analysis , a Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA), a Structural Equation Modeling (SEM), and a Multigroup Analysis.", "3.9.1 Descriptive analysis Initial tests included Frequency and Descriptive tests to analyze Mean , Skewness, Kurtosis , Correlation , and a t -test to examine the existence of difference s between the means of groups .", "3.9.2 Confirmatory Factor Analysis", "Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) was applied to verify the quality of the defined variables and its capability to represent how capable they were in correctly representing the constructs in a pre -defined conceptual model conceived from theory (Hair, Black, Babin, & Anderson, 2009) .", "Based on the results of the Descriptive analysis, it was supported that the sample data utilized did not present multinormality. From this, the technique applied to estimate the measurement model was Asymptotic Distribution Free (ADF) which perfor ms better when given non -normally distributed data in comparison to the most common Maximum Likehood (ML) technique which strongly accounts on multinormality in the data set for correct estimations.", "To test the validity of the measurement model, a group of five goodness -of-fit indicators were utilized: Chi-square ( χ²), Normed chi-square ( χ²/gl), Comparative Fit Index ( CFI) and the Root Mean Squared Error of Approximation (RMSEA). The chi -square test calculates the difference between two covariance matrixes , one deemed estimated which represents the proposed theory and one deemed observed that consists of the reality resultant of the sample data. The smaller the difference between these values, the close r they are of being equal – the Null hypothesis of the chi-square test (Hair, Black, Babin, & Anderson, 2009) .", "The Normed chi -square is another indicator that consists o f the original chi -square difference divided by the degrees of freedom from a given model. Even though this model is more sensitive towards larger data samples, it is also able to evidence models with better fit. For the acceptance of goodness -of-fit in this indicator a value below 3 or, at least, below 5 is advised (Hair, Black, Babin, & A nderson, 2009) . The Comparative Fit Index (CFI) is an indicator derived from the Normed Fit Index (NFI) , but with some improvements . Both calculate the χ² difference between two models – one fitted and one null – and divide the result by the χ² value from the null model. Results variate from 0 to 1 where values getting closer to 1 represent a better fit for the model . Overall, a model is considered to have good fit with a resultant value of 0.90 or above (Hair, Black, Babin, & Anderson, 2009) .", "The Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA) is a fit indicator that more accurately demonstrates the fit of the model for the population than just the estimation sample utilized. Moreover, it is an indicator that seeks to compensate for very large sample sizes and also for model complexity. The lower the resultant value, the better the fit of the model where a value lower than 0.05 is considered good (Hair, Black, Babin, & Anderson, 2009) .", "The next step was to examine the Construct Reliability of the measurement model . Such is verified through the co mposite reliability test or CR whi ch examines how well the pre -defined items in each construct of the concept model can explain the construct itself. It is calculated by making the squared sum of the factor loadings of each individual construct and dividing it by the squared sum of the fac tor loadings plus the sum of the errors in variance for each construct. It is considered that values as high as 0.7 represent good reliability, but values between 0.6 and 0.7 may represent acceptable reliability (Hair, Black, Bab in, & Anderson, 2009) .", "In sequence, the Convergent Validity and Discriminant Validity were used to test the validity of the model, . The first one is used to verify how strongly related are the indicators present in a given construct of the model where high covariance indicates better convergent validity. This is estimated through the Average Variance Extracted (AVE) which calculates the sum of squared standardized loading of each item divided by the number of items for each construct present in the model. It is accepted than an AVE of 0.5 or above evidence convergence in the individual construct. The second one is used to verify how strongly di stinct are the different constructs in the model where low covariance indicates better discriminant validity . This is estimated by comparing the AVE of two separate constructs of the model to the estimated squared covariance that exists between these two constructs. If the AVE values from both constructs exceed the calculated squared covariance, then the constructs ca n be considered discriminant (Hair, Black, Babin, & Anderson, 2009) .", "3.9.3 Structural Equation Modeling", "The Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) is a technique that analyses the interrelationships that exists among constructs – and i ts many individual variables – in a defined model through a sequence of equations. Specific traits of the SEM distinguish it from the remaining multivariate techniques. The technique can estimate multiple regression calculations simultaneously which are in dependent from each other but interrelated based on the defined connections of the structural model. The technique is capable of analyzing concept ual variables (latent variables) that are composed by actual measured variables. This is optimal, since these variables together can reduce measurement error and enhance statistical estimation. Last, it requires a model with specified relationships to be previously defined and strongly sustained by antecedent theory (Hair, Black, Babin, & Anderson, 2009) . To verify how well the model fits, it is necessary to verify the links or paths established among the latent variables of the defined model. The hypothesized path estimates are considered supported if the calculated P - value returns a r esult below 0.05 (Hair, Black, Babin, & Anderson, 2009) .", "3.9.4 Multigroup SEM Analysis Characteristics of individual responses on a data sample that segregate them into specific groups may present some differences within the same e stimated model (Hair,", "Black, Babin, & Anderson, 2009) . As such, to evidence the existence or absence of these differences between the groups, a series of invariance tests and Critical Ratio difference tests were performed. The invariance tests consist of progressively imposing more constraints in the elements of the structural models and verify if the y still maintain an equal representation of the constructs (Hair, Black, Babin, & Anderson, 2009) . In the case of Metric Invariance , it creates equivalence constraints in the factor loadings . For Scalar Invariance it adds equivalence constraints in the model’s path coefficients. For Factor Covariance, it adds equivalence constrains for the covariances. For Factor Variance it adds equivalence constraints in the latent variable errors. For Error Variance, it adds equivalence constraints in the measured variables errors. The evidence of invariance is validated by the difference in chi -square, difference in degrees of freedom and the p -value from the chi -square and degrees of freedom difference s. Small Δχ2 , small Δdf and a p-value higher than 0.05 sustain the presence of invariance .", "The last test was a supportive moderation test which solely constrained the path between the dependent variable Fit / Aut to the independent variable OBE and the path between the dependent variable OBE and the independent variable PIn. The test first verifies if the paths between those variables are indeed valid (p -value below 0.01). If valid , the test then checks the difference between the C .R. (Critical Ratio) of the same path of the two groups . If the modular difference results are above 1.96 then it can be statistically stated that there is evidence for modularity between groups.", "3.10 EMERGENT CONCEPTUAL MODELS", "Based on the results from the analysis , it was verified that a high correlation existed between the constructs Fit and Authenticity, making it difficult to proceed with the analysis of hypotheses H1 and H2 .", "Thus, two new alternative models were proposed and tested (see Figure 2 and Figure 3): one to verify the sole effect of Fit as the independent variable and one to verify the sole effect of Authenticity as the independent variable. Additionally , given the non-significant effect of Compulsion on Overall Brand Equity (hypothesis H3) , the Compulsion construct was readapted from an independent variable into a moderating one which could evidence the difference between fan groups based on the relationship intensity with the game , that i s, those that showed Low compulsion from those who showed High compulsion .", "Figure 2 – Conceptual Alternative Model 1 – Fit", "From this proposed model, the following hypothes es were established: H1AM1: Fit has a positive impact on sponsor’s overall brand equity H2AM1: Sponsor’s overall brand equity has a positive impact on consumer’s purchase intention of sponsor’s products.", "H3AM1: The age group of a League of Legends fan does not moderate the relationship between Sponsor -event Fit and the sponsor’s overall brand equity.

H4AM2: The compulsive nature of League of Legends fans moderates the relationship betw een Authenticity and the sponsor’s overall brand equity. For both models , tests were performed to verify model fit, in the case of the Structural Models , and to verify invariance in the case of moderating variables. To perform the moderation test for Age group it was decided to use the median from the age to segment the sample into two groups: Young and Adult. To perform the moderation test for Level of Compulsion , it was necessary to convert the six indicators from the Compulsion construct into a single substitute indicator that could be separated into two groups: Low Compulsion and High Compulsion . To perform this, the estimates of each indicator towards the Compulsion construct were calculated. The substitute variable was defined as the weighted averag e of its six variables divided by the sum of its weights in which the calculated estimates served as the weights for each indicator. From the results, the median of the substitute variable was calculated and used to separate the sample into the two mention ed groups.", "4 RESULTS 4.1 CHARACTERISTICS OF THE SAMPLE", "A total of 1,137 responses were collected.

Next, the moderation tests were performed for OBE < ̶ ̶ ̶ AUT Constrained and PIn < ̶ ̶ ̶ OBE Constrained.

The perceived Fit between sponsor and event positively affect s the sponsor’s overall brand equity .", "This finding offers additional support to the literature that describes fit as a process of interactions that occur between the shared meanings held within different brands (Gwinner K. , 1997) . As these interactions become progressive ly more developed, individuals and groups more easily correlate these associations and the feelings generated within their minds (Drengner, Jahn, & Zanger, 2011) to the point that positive relationships formed towards one of tho se elements , like a sport event or team, for example , is also transported to the associated element – in this case the sponsor brand – that is present (Weeks, Humphreys, & Cornwell, 2018) .", "The not so strong explanatory power of Fit on Overall Brand Equity in this study could be associated to two main reasons: (1) The fact that this study cover ed eSports and not traditional sports as previous studies did. (2) The fact that many of the sponsors were rather recent entrants and have yet to form these strong bonds with consumer s. The studies that evidenced the role of fit as a good explainer of valuable elements of a brand such as its image (Gwinner, Larson, & Swanson, 2009) , awareness (Cornwell, Humphreys, Maguire, Weeks, & Tellegen, 2006) and attitude (Koo, Quarterman, & Flynn, 2006) alongside other elements such as sponsorship response (Speed & Thompson, 2000) and tes ting of different congruence types (Drengner, Jahn, & Zanger, 2011) in the context of traditional sports is vast, but that is not the case for eSports which have few articles where the fit construct has been used (Rogers, Farquhar, & Mummert, 2020) . Thus, it is possible that Fit, which ha d functioned well in the context of sports, does not yield the same effects in the eSports scenario, considering that, although they share similar names, their realiti es have major differences . Recent research in field of eSports still strives to discuss if it can be considered sport or not (Hallmann & Giel, 2018) and other studies continue to investigate the motivation of eSports fans (Pizzo, et al., 2018) from which some were able to evidence similarities among them and traditional fans but with differences still existing and limited to the elements investigated (Cushen, Another explanation may be the fact that many of the sponsor s examined in this study were recent partners of this event and some have entered in the eSport Brazilian industry quite recently. The longest sponsors of the CBLOL examined in this st udy (Gillette, Red Bull and Dell) ha ve been sponsoring this event for just three years. Research has shown that total sponsoring time is a key element for a brand to be more widely noticed by the audience (Ruth & Strizhakova, 2012) and this is similar to the case of Fit itself, in which associations take time and experience until they stick to a person’s schema.", "5.1.2 Does perceived Authenticity of the sponsoring brand positively affect the sponsor’s overall brand equity?", "Yes, it does. The Authenticity of the sponsoring brand positively affect s the sponsor’s overall brand equity.", "This find ing offers additional support to the literature that de fines Authenticity (or sincerity / credibility) as the perception of a brand held in cons umer’s minds where its image is perceived as being more altruistic (Rifon, Choi, Trimble, & Li, 2004) and sincerely motivated (Speed & Thompson, 2000) which works as a source of positive information f or the corporate image (Koo & Lee, 2019) aside from its relevan cy in generating brand engagement (Becker -Olsen & Hill, 2006) , improving brand attitude (Rifon, Choi, Trimble, & Li, 2004) and directly or indirectly influencing its equity (Speed So, t he good explanatory power of Authenticity on Overall Brand Equity in this study was supported twofold: In the original model, alongside fit; and in the alternative model, without fit.", "5.1.3 Do compulsive tendencies of fans positively affect the sponsor’s overall brand equity?", "No, it does not. It was not possible to support that the compulsive tendencies of fans af fect sponsor’s overall brand equity.", "In fact, as of this study, no research has specifically examined the effects that a fan’s compulsive tendency ha s on their responses towards the sponsors of a sport event. In the case of compulsive sport consumers, sinc e they suffer from impulsive and obsessive disorders that affect their motivations and behaviors (O'Guinn & Faber, 1989; Ridgway, Kukar -Kinney, & Monroe, 2008) , it was expected that their primary identification with the sport event would favorably rub off to the associated sponsors, even though related with some negative behaviors (Hunt, Bristol, & Bashaw, 1999; Thorne & Thorne, 2006) .", "In this study it was not possible to support nei ther (a) a direct effect of compulsion on sponsor’s overall brand equity in the original model; nor (b) a moderation effect of compulsion on the relationships of fit and authenticity on the sponsor’s overall brand equity in the alternative models .", "5.1.4 Does a sponsor’s overall brand equity positively affect the purchase intention of its products?", "Yes, it does. The sponsor’s overall brand equity positively affects the purchase intention of its products.", "This find ing offers additional support to the literatur e that demonstrate s the various elements that account for the total value of a brand in the intention to purchase the its product such as awareness (Ko, Kim, Claussen, & Kim, 2008) , integrity (Smith, Graetz, & Westerbeek, 2008) , attitude (Spears & Singh, 2004) and overall equity (Cobb - Walgren, Ruble, & Donthu, 1995) .", "The good explanatory power of Overall Brand Equity on Purchase Intention in this study might be linked to the value that eSports fans perceive in the sponsoring brands within eSports events which may have a considerable influence over the likelihood to buy that brand’s product over similar others.", "5.1.5 Can the endemic or non -endemic natu re of a sponsor affect the relationship between the sponsor’s overall brand equity and (a) sponsor -event fit; (b) authenticity of the sponsoring brand ; and (c) compulsive tendencies of eSport fans? The limitations of sample size and number of mentioned bra nds made it problematic to perform a multigroup test for Endemic/Non -endemic differences. Regarding the brands, Dell was the only endemic amid 4 non -endemic brands. Besides, only 15 respondents from the entire sample chose Dell as their brand, and so moder ation test for endemic/non -endemic differences was not possible.", "5.1.6 Can the fans’ age group affect the relationship between (a) the sponsor’s overall brand equity and sponsor -event fit; (b) the sponsor’s overall brand equity and authenticity; and (c) betwee n purchase intention and sponsor’s overall brand equity ? No, there is no evidence of it. Fans’ age group does not affect the relationship between (a) the sponsor’s overall brand equity and sponsor -event fit; (b) the sponsor’s overall brand equity and authe nticity; and (c) between purchase intention and sponsor’s overall brand equity . The results can be considered a novelty in the field of sports and eSports. These results diverge from previous research that suggested a moderation in age. This may be explain ed by a few reasons. First, the sample utilized in this study accounts only for respondents whose age was above 18 years old may not be representative of certain profiles. Although some similarities are shared between eSports and traditional sports, the de mographics of the fans of the former tend to present an audience of younger age (below 18 years old) when compared to the latter (Duran, 2021) . Thus, effects of age may be different than those from traditional sports.", "Moreov er, it is often considered that fans of younger and older age distinguish themselves in regards to their relationship intensity with the sports and, consequently their brands. That is a fan of younger age may show stronger feeling towards a sport in compar ison to an older fan who may maintain bonds wit h the sport, but not as strong. In contrast to this, however, the current study demonstrated that this fact does not unfold in the context of eSports .", "5.1.7 Can the fans’ compulsion affect the relationship between (a) the sponsor’s overall brand equity and sponsor -event fit; (b) the sponsor’s overall brand equity and authenticity; and (c) between purchase intention and sponsor’s overall brand equity? No, there is no evidence of it . Fans’ compulsion does not affect the relationship between (a) the sponsor’s overall brand equity and sponsor -event fit; (b) the sponsor’s overall brand equity and authenticity; and (c) between purchase intention and sponsor’s overall brand equity .", "There was an expectation of moderation fr om this variable since a compulsive fan would probably retain more intense habits and interactions with many different elements and sources of content from the studied game, like hours played in the game, hours watching related online content, in -game item s bought and a stronger relationship towards brands associated with elements of the game. However, since no previous research had used Compulsion as a moderator for Fit or Authenticity to wards Overall Brand Equity in the context of sports , there were no av ailable references to compare to. Yet, these results can be regarded as novelty for the field of eSports sponsorship .", "5.2 MANAGERIAL IMPLICATIONS", "5.2.1 Relevance of Brand Authenticity for eSports fans Even though sports sponsors are engaging in events and striving to create a positive and authentic image within the scenario they must be aware that parallel projects or actions in other segments also rub off in their overall brand image which can create inconsistencies from the perspective of fans and harm the develo pment of the brand as authentic (Speed & Thompson, 2000) .", "Based on the results, similar to the case of traditional sports, companies that are able and seek to create an image that associates itself well and authentically to the context of eSports and the sponsored game as a whole may achieve much more positive results than brands with no initiative whatsoever. As the eSports industry expands its horizons towards different geographies , opportunities to reach a wider fan audience also increase , leading to an expansion of brands seeking the attention of these fans. As such, firms that develop strategies that create natural and legitimate bond s with the sponsored games tends to more easily approach the fan base, which is especially relevant for the non -endemic brands.", "Overall, successful games and eSports are not mere electronic games. They are also characterized by whole unique worlds and contexts that concede to each game a group of elements that distinguish one from the other and i mprove the players immersion in their universes. Series like World of Warcraft, Overwatch and League of Legends are examples of games that molded a distinctive aesthetic appearance to themselves and attributed a context to their worlds and characters in a way that the fan becomes more involved and identified with events and changes that occur in them. In parallel, other eSports such as Counter -Strike and Free Fire, although not developing the game’s context extensively, are able to engage its fans through p layability and competition inherent to them.", "Companies such as DHL, for example, obtained historical success as sponsors of the Electronic Sports League (ESL) of the eSport Dota 2 after creating a commercial video (Hayward, 2018) in which one of the company’s biggest services is naturally integrated with one of the basic playability functions of the game. Another example is the case of Gillette which is responsible for many initiatives in the world of eSpor ts such as Gillette UL T, a reality show focused on the training journey of professional LOL players (Colodel, 2018) , and in commercials performed with celebrities of the game such as Gabriel Bohm Santos (aka Kami).", "In summary, it is recommended that future eSport sponsors, either from League of Legends or another game, develop creative and innovative ways to present themselves to fans and spectators as a method to create intertextuality with unique attributes of the game as to form fit besides clearl y transmitting the intention of mutual support between the brand and event being sponsored.", "5.2.2 Lack of relevance regarding Compulsion for eSports fans The compulsion in games is a phenomenon already recognized. As a result of effects that games generate for fans such as reality escape (Hamari & Sjöblom, 2017) and social interactions (Seo, 2016) , some fans establish compulsive relationships with these games which may lead to mild negative habits , such as excessive playing and loss of healthy habits (Yin, et al., 2020) , up until more severe consequences such as violence (Kou, 2020) and depression (Kwak, Blackburn, & H an, 2015) . Some of these habits also include an increasing consumption of goods (virtual or real) and services that further optimize the fans experience inside the game.", "From these insights, it was expected that compulsion would relate to a wider percept ion of the value of the sponsoring brand. The fan, maintaining a more extensive and compulsive relationship with the game, would play and watch more content in comparison to fans with such habits in a lesser degree. Thus, there was a logical expectation th at elements directly or indirectly associated to the compulsive consumed game ( i.e., the case of sponsoring brands) would benefit through recognition, valuing or even through compulsive fans’ buying behavior.", "However, in this study it was not possible to demonstrate this effect , that is, the intensity the fan demonstrates towards the game does not distinguish his perception of the sponsoring brands from those of non -compulsive fans.", "It could be speculated that this result may be related to the non -endemic characteristic of the sponsors which do not deeply affect the fan’s consumption experience of the game. The compulsive fan w ould focus on searching new and better ways of maintaining and improving the consumption of his compulsion. In the context of games this could be related to items or abilities available inside the game which improves the fans overall experience either through mere aesthetics (skins and icons) or other means that elevate their competitive capacity (in -game upgrades, better computer equi pment). Thus, fans may feel more attracted towards brands such as Alienware and Logitech whose products directly affect their game performance and, consequently, less attracted towards brands such as Gillette and Red Bull that, being non -endemic, would not strongly and directly affect the game’s consumption experience. However, it is important to note that it was not possible to test the moderation effect of endemic/non - endemic sponsorship in this study.", "5.3 LIMITATIONS", "The study presents some limitation tha t must be highlighted. These can be summarized in 5 categories: (1) Concept ual Model, (2) Data Collection, (3) Sample size, (4) Age over 18 years old, (5) Scale Issues, (6) Questionnaire filters, (7) Utilized methods, (8) Sponsor brand differences , (9) the usage of Overall Brand Equity .", "5.3.1 Limitations concerning the Conceptual Model", "The originally conceptualized model considered the fit between sponsor and event, the authenticity between sponsor and event and compulsion traits of the respondents as independe nt variables that would be positively related to the overall brand equity of the sponsoring brand. However, it was evidenced the strong correlation between Fit and Authenticity made it impracticable to apply both constructs together, besides the fact that Compulsion did not help explain Overall Brand Equity at all. From these results, it was necessary to readapt the original model into two alternative models with the same structure but distinguished independent variables: one model for Fit and one for Authe nticity. Compulsion was readapted as a moderating variable and was tested alongside age. So, two functional models were obtained, but at the cost of altering the original proposition of the study.", "5.3.2 Limitations concerning the Data Collection At first, the data collection period for this research was 3 months, from August to October 2021 . However, it was finished in January of 2022, taking a total of 6 months. This was due to a variety of challenges such as contacting and engaging individual", "respondents and communities online , performing the collection alone, and a large number of unusable respon ses filtered out .", "This long period of time may have created a difference between respondents that answered the questionnaire in the very beginning from those that par ticipated in a late stage of the collection . The CBLOL 2021 edition took place in August and September 2021. It is possible that earlier respondents may have remembered the sponsoring brands more easily than those who answered 5 to 6 months after the champ ionship finals . As time progressed from the championship finals, respondents showed more unlikeliness to correctly remember a sponsor brand of the event, decreasing the effectiveness of the collection process, since sponsor brand recall was one of the fil ters.", "5.3.3 Limitations concerning Sample size", "Another issue was the final sample size of 440 and distribution which was not large and balanced enough in order to compare certain groups or estimate some moderation effects .", "First, it was not possible to verify the differences based on the chosen brands by respondents since the sample did not present the minimum size necessary for each brand. Second, it was not possible to verify the differences based on respondent’s gender . The sample presented an unbalanced number of respondents towards the male gender (81%) and female gender (16%). Female respondents accounted for a total of 7 2 responses which was not enough to perform moderation tests. Third, an Endemic vs. Non-endemic test was not able to be performed. This i s due to the diffe rence in non-endemic and endemic brands sponsoring CBLOL which was not equal. Besides, the endemic brand (Dell) was the least recalled sponsor from the sample, so achieving a necessary minimum number for this test would have been very unl ikely.", "5.3.4 Limitations concerning respondents age over 18 years old Part of the established filter from the beginning of the study was to account only for respondents whose age was above 18 years old. This was mainly decided as a way to establish a base val ue for economically active individuals as one of the dependent variables utilized is purchase intention. One issue, however, was the fact that the demographics of eSports fans are generally of young adults , as the current study show s, and individuals under 18 years old who account for a considerable p ercentage from the total. By not considering their responses , the diversity of the study’s sample is reduced, making it unfeasible to test for group possible differences from this underage group.", "5.3.5 Limitations concerning the Scales issues", "Although two pre -tests were applied followed by a series of modifications to improve the questionnaire, it still presented some issues for the comprehension of respondents. The scales of Overall Brand Equity and Purchase Inten tion still endured challenges when the chosen brand was Mastercard . The characteristic of the brand as not being a product and also not being directly bought by consumers made the ph rases in both scales difficult for respondents to interpretate and provide their most accurate opinions.", "5.3.6 Limitations concerning the method", "The Maximum Likehood (ML) method is the generally used model for Structural Equation Modeling, however it heavily account s on the multi normality of the sample data utilized as a basis to pr ovide trustable results. In this research, from the very beginning of the analysis it was clear that the variables would not have a normal distribution which, most of the time, is the case for questionnaire -based research. So, the ADF technique was applied instead which is the most ideal method for not normally distributed sample data, but its results still suffer from precision issues when compared to the ML technique .", "5.3.7 Limitations concerning the questionnaire’s filters The questionnaire included an initi al section of questions that filtered out respondents depending on the given answers. The purpose of this tactic was to remove possible profile biases that could affect the study’s results. However, the amount of filtering questions added also caused some issues. First it affected the collection process as only 1/3 of obtained responses were valid . Besides , a heavy reliance on filter questions can create biases toward a very specific respondent profile which is not something desired.", "5.3.8 Limitations concerni ng the Sponsor brands", "The main purpose of the study was to measure the perception of value of the five sponsoring brands from the perspective of the audience. Even though the research focused on providing the perspectives of a filtered group of respondents , it still suffered from a limitation concerning the characteristics of the sponsors. They included brands from different industries (personal care, financial services, beverages, snacks, hard & software) who had sponsored the event for different periods o f time and applied stronger or weaker strategies to form bonds in the minds of fans. As such, while the sponsoring brands distinguish themselves from each other, the chosen model measured them from a global perspective. Additionally, there was not enough d ata available to measure the possible moderating effect between each of the brands, and, based on their characteristics, the possibility cannot be refuted.", "5.3.9 The usage of an Overall Brand Equity scale", "Brand Equity was one of the most important dependent v ariables of this study, however it was not utilized in its complete format. Originally, the Yoo & Donthu scale was a multidimensional scale with 10 items that can be segmented into 9 subdimensions. In contrast, this study only utilized 4 items to represen t the entirety of Brand Equity. This may have created a limitation to obtain a deeper understanding of the equity of the sponsoring brands, even though previous studies of sport sponsorship have utilized the 4 - item scale to represent it (Amorim & Almeida, 2015; Düsenberg, Almeida, & Amorim, 2016; Coelho, de Amorim, & de Almeida, 2019) .", "5.4 SUGGESTIONS", "5.4.1 Authenticity and Fit relationship", "An important matter to consider is the strong relationship between fit and authenticity. Previous literature has shown that ideas of brand fit are not so far off those of authenticity. For example, it has been evidenced their simultaneous effects towards explaining sponsor brand equity (Wang, Cheng, Purwanto , & Erimurti, 2011) . As such, having fit may be an important element to achieve authenticity which can be a struggle for many non -endemic eSport sponsors since many operate under an image that is yet to be more deeply connected with the eSports context (Rifon, Choi, Trimble, & Li, 2004) . So, it is strongly advised to further explore this relationship, specifically to assess if it is adequate to use simultaneously Fit and Authenticity to explain sponsors overall brand equity in eSports .", "5.4.2 Model validation in other eSports", "The current model was applied for fans of a specific eSports game: League of Legends. This was motivated by the fact that this game is the most important eSport in Brazil in terms of number of fans , streaming au dience, hours watched and so on (Belous, 2020; Borisov, 2021) . Still, this research has only examined one of various eSports played in Brazil whose audience s’ opinions about the sponsors still remain unstudied. Thus, it is suggest ed that future studies in the field of eSports sponsorship reapply th ese model s (Fit and/or Authenticity) to the context of other games.", "5.4.3 Model validation for team sponsoring and celebrity sponsor", "The proposed model is the study was used to estimate the perceived value of the sponsoring brands of an event by the fans of the game. The current research did not account as its object of study the sponsors of eSports teams or celebrities. These fields present considerable opportunities of study since eSports teams and celebrities are known to form stronger bonds with the audience in comparison to event sponsors (Cornwell T. B., 1995) . It is suggest ed that following studies validate if Fit or Authenticity present stronger explanatory power in the case of teams and/or celebrities.", "5.4.4 Validation of other moderating variables As discussed in the chapter of limitations, some moderation effects were not able to be estimate d such as the demographics of gender and the distinct ion of endemic vs. non-endemic brand s, alongside other equally important moderating variables like geographic region , level of schooling and socioeconomic class . This study suggests that future research attempt to collect more social and economic informati on from respondents to verify possible moderation effects .", "5.4.5 The role of marketing agencies for sponsorships and other projects As exemplified previously, the growth of the eSports industry has led to the emergence of marketing agencies whose purpose is to help companies develop sponsorship strategies for their brands focused on the videogame and eSports market. That said, these agencies have a major importance in influencing the success of marketing campaign within the eSports scenario which may also affec t the improvement of the sponsor’s overall brand equity and purchase intention. Thus, it is suggest ed that future research attempt s to examine the roles of these agencies and the effect that their presence may generate in the brand’s equity and purchase in tention.", "5.4.6 The role of marketing agencies for sponsorships and other projects As exemplified previously, the growth of the eSports industry has led to the emergence of marketing agencies whose purpose is to help companies develop sponsorship strategies for their brands focused on the videogame and eSports market.

C onsequently, this may help to form stronger bonds between fans, eSports and sponsor that is not a reality in the context of traditional sports. Thus, comparing fan’s level of engagement and the sponsoring brand strategies between traditional sports and eSports may be a relevant contribution to the literature .", "6 REFERENCES", "A Crítica.

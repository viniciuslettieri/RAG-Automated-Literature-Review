A ausência de IPs específicos à avaliação da s capacid ades legais (CL) referentes a responsabilidade penal favorece a elevada divergência entre peritos na avaliação de um mesmo caso , o que prejudica tecnicamente a execução da perícia . A presente pesquisa resultou em quatro artigos. O primeiro artigo pesquisou a incidência de comportamento violento em uma amostra de pacientes com o diagnóstico de esquizofrenia internados em um hospital psiquiátrico clínico através do HCR -20 e da Modified Overt Aggressive Scale (MOAS) . Os resultados indicaram uma performance satisfatória do HCR -20 para a identificação dos grupos violento e não violento, com destaque para os itens histórico prévio de violência (item H1), impulsividade (C4) e estresse (R5). Os itens do questionário sociodemográfico que apresentam maior relevância e statística foram o histórico prévio de internação por comportamento violento e concordância com o tratamento. O segundo artigo foi uma revisão sistemática da literatura, com o método PRISMA, para identificar possíveis fatores de vieses capazes de vii", "causar divergência entre examinadores na avaliação de um mesmo caso submetido a perícia crimina l. Os resultados apontaram para diferentes fatores capazes de gerar vieses nas avaliações periciais em matéria criminal , que foram agrupados em três categorias, de acordo com o tipo de viés identificado: fatores legais, instrumentos psicométricos e técnicas de avaliação forense. O terceiro artigo consistiu no desenvolvimento e validação do EIP em réus submetidos ao exame de responsabilidade penal em um instituto de períc ias criminais do Rio de Janeiro . O EIP apresentou índices estatísticos satisfatórios, com boa adequação à solução estatística de dois fatores , resultado em um ponto de corte de 30.50 (±2) e um índice de Youden de 0.509) O quarto artigo buscou ident ificar os grupos de conclusão pericial (imputável, semi -imputável e inimputável) através de traços de personalidade psicopática, através do PCL -R. Os resultados apontaram para diferenças estatisticamente significativas apenas para a faceta 4 (antissocial) do PCL -R (p= 0.028). A comparação grupo -a-grupo do indicou diferenças estatisticamente moderadas entre os grupos inimputável -imputável (p= 0.052) e inimputável -semi -imputável (p=0.058).

Secondarily, we compared clinical and forensi c psychiatric populations with psychometric tools (PT) developed for risk assessment of violence : the Historical, Clinical and Management 20 (HCR -20) e o Psychopathic Checklist Revised (PCL -R). Additionally, we search for bias factors that could explain th e high incidence of divergences between experts in forensic psychiatric exams. The Brazilian Penal Code , in the Article 26, authorizes the criminal responsibility (CR) forensic psychiatric exams . In these expertise, the four component of the biopsychological criteria are evaluated: 1) the diagnosis of a mental disorder, 2) the causality between the clinical symptoms of mental disorder and offense committed, 3) the capacity for understanding (CU) a nd the capacity for determination (CD, related to offense committed, and 4) chronological nexus about all these elements. Actually, there are two PTs structured in checklists developed to evaluate CR. However, there are not to date any PT structured in cli nical vignette to assess the legal capacities (LC), such as CU and CD, to complement CR forensic psychiatric exam. The inexistence of PTs for the assessment of LCs limits technically the forensic psychiatry expertise. This research resulted in four article s. The first article research the incidence of violent behavior in a sample of schizophrenic patients admitted in a clinical psychiatric hospital by the HCR - 20 and the Modified Overt Aggressive Behavior (MOAS). The results presented a satisfactory performa nce of the HCR -20 for the identification of the violent and non - violent groups, with emphasis on the previous historical items of violence (item H1), impulsivity ( item C4) and stress ( item R5). The items in the sociodemographic questionnaire that have the better statistical significance were the previous history of hospitalization for violent behavior and agreement with treatment . The second article was a systematic review of the literature, with the PRISMA method, to identify possible bias factors capable of causing disagreement among examiners in the evaluation of the same case submitted to criminal expertise . The results indicated multiple factors able of causing bias in forensic assessments in crimi nal matters, which were grouped into three categories, according to the type of bias identified: legal factors, psychometric tools and ix", "forensic assessment techniques . The third article was the development and validation of CRS in a sample of offenders submitted to criminal responsibilit y assessment in a forensic psychiatric institute in Rio de Janeiro . The EIP presented satisfactory statistical performance , the two -factor solution proved satisfactory , with a resulting cutoff point of 30.50 (±2) and a Youden index of 0.509 . The fourth art icle aimed to identify the expert conclusion groups (imputable, semi -imputable and non -imputable) through psychopathic personality traits with the PCL -R. The results pointed to statistically significant differences only for facet 4 (antisocial) of the PCL -R (p = 0.028) . The group -to-group comparison of indicated statistically moderate differences between the unimputable and imputable (p = 0.052) , and the unimputable and semi -imputable groups (p = 0.058) .", "Finally, the results and conclusions of the articles were compiled in order to gather the elements to respond to the objectives (mai n and secondary) of this survey.", "x", "LISTA DE SIGLAS AlaSATcom – Alabama Structured Assessment of Treatment Completion for Insanity Acquittees ALI – American Law Institute BPRS – Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale CD – Capacity for determination CRS – Criminal Resposi bility Scale CU – Capacity for undertanding CST – Competence to stand trial CR – Criminal responsibility DSM 5 – Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 5° edition FP – Forensic psychiatry GAF – Global assessment of functioning GCCT – Georgia Court Competence Test HCR -20 – Historial, Clinical, and Risck Management -20 ICD-10 – International Classification of disorders 10° edition KS – Teste de Kruskal Wallis LC – Legal capacity MacCAT -FP – MacArthur Competence Assessment Tool – Fitness to Plead MacCAT -CA – MacArthur Criminal Competence Assessment Tool – Criminal Adjudication MacCAT -T – MacArthur Competence Assessment Tool for Treatment MMSE – Mini Mental State Exam MOAS – Modified O vert Aggressive Scale MW – Mann Whitney test xi", "PAI – Personality Assessment Inventory PCL-R – Psychopathic Checklist Revised PT – Psychometric tool R-CRAS – Roger Criminal Responsibility Scale RSCRs – Rating scale of criminal responsibility for mentally disordered offenders VRAG – Violence Risk Appraisal Guide WAIS -IV – Escala Wechsler de Inteligência para Adultos 4ed", "xii", "LISTA TABELAS E FIGURAS", "number of questions, with division into subscales of comprehension and determination fatores separados por grupos de responsabilidade penal _______________________ _121 grupos imputáveis, semi -imputáveis e inimputáveis ___________________________1 22 xiii", "xiv", "SUMÁRIO 1.2.1- Avaliação psiquiátrico -forense de responsabilidade penal no Brasil _________ __15 1.2.2 - Avaliação de responsabilidade penal nas j urisprudências de outros países____ __18 1.2.3 - Capacidades legais na responsabilidade penal e psicopatologia forense ______ __19 1.2.4 - Instrumentos psicométricos na prática forense _________________________ __21 1.2.5 - Como expl icar a elevada divergência entre examinadores na avali ação de um 1.2.6 - É possível ao psiquiatra forense distinguir tecnicamente entre graus intermediários 2.1- Estudo 1: Schizophrenia and violence: a study in a general psychiatric hospital with 2.2- Estudo 2: How to explain forensic p sychiatric experts’ disagreement in the same criminal case?

A pergunta que me inquietou durante todo esse período foi: será possível que o projeto orig inal de Karl Jaspers em psicopatologia, desenvolvido na obra “Psicopatologia Geral” (JASPERS, 1968, 1997) , seja válido sob a perspectiva científica atual?", "Hoje, vejo que toda a minha jornada na psiquiatria como a busca por um “question amento” que pudesse abarcar a introdução da obra “Psicopatologia Geral”. Esse ganhou forma, nitidez e corporeidade durante a residência médica em psiquiatria clínica e, em especial, no quarto ano de residência médica em psiquiatria forense. Outro trabalho que trouxe inspiração ao tema da presente tese de doutorado, foi a tese de doutorado do professor Miguel Chalub, que se mostra presente e atual na prática da psiquiatria forense (CHALUB, 1981) . Sinceramente, espero ter conseguido dar contribuições a ambos os trabalhos com essa pesquisa de doutorado.", "1.2 - INTRODUÇÃO 1.2.1 – Avaliação psiquiátrico -forense de responsabilidade cr iminal no Brasil A psiquiatria forense (PF) é uma subárea de atuação da psiquiatria, cuja a tarefa primordial é o esclarecimento das autoridades legais e operadores do direito em elementos técnico -legais relacionados à psiquiatria (ABDALLA -FILHO, TELLES, et al. , 2016, ROSNER, SCOTT, 2017) . Esta interface ocorre através de e xames periciais, cujo o foco varia de acordo com o objetivo da avaliação e a esfera judicial de sua realização (Civil, Criminal, Trabalhista ou de Família) (ABDALLA -FILHO, 2017, ABDALLA -FILHO, TELLES, et al. , 2016) . O objetivo principal da avaliação pericial na PF é a produção de laudo pericial, q ue visa esclarecer a autoridade competente (judicial ou administrativa), de maneir a clara, objetiva e imparcial, com os elementos técnicos necessários ao esclarecimento da lide processual.", "A perícia em responsabilidade criminal (RC) é um dos principais ti pos de exame realizados na PF (HUNGRIA, FRAGOSO, 1983, PEIXOTO, 1935, TABORDA, 2001) . Ness as, o critério biopsicológico é o principal fundamento teórico norteador do psiquiatra", "perito nesse tipo de exame, através do qual são avaliados quatro elementos: 1) a presença de diagnóstico psiquiátrico; 2) o nexo de causalid ade entre os sintomas ativos do diagnóstico psiquiátrico e a prática do delito; 3) o grau de preservação das capacidades de entendimento e determinação, durante a prática do delito; e 4) o nexo cronológico (ABDALLA -FILHO, TELLES, et al. , 2016, HUNGRIA, FRAGOSO, 1983, PEIXOT O, 1935, TABORDA, 2001) . O critério biopsicológico se encontra no artigo 26 do Código Penal Brasileiro (HUNGRIA, FRAGOSO, 1983, TABORDA, 2001) , sendo destacado a seguir:", "“Art. 26 - É isento de pena o agente que, por doença mental ou desenvolvimento mental incompleto ou retardado, era, ao tempo da ação ou da omissão, inteiramente incapaz de entender o caráter ilícito do fato ou de determinar -se de acordo com esse entendimento.” “Parágrafo único - A pena pode ser reduzida de um a dois terços, se o agente, em virtude de perturbação de saú de mental ou por desenvolvimento mental incompleto ou retardado não era inteiramente capaz de entender o caráter ilícito do fato ou de determinar -se de acordo com esse entendimento.” O escrutínio dos elementos acima mencionados é fundamental à compreensã o precisa do critério biopsicológico. A verificação do diagnóstico psiquiátrico configura o elemento biológico do critério biopsicológico e pode ser classificado em quatro categorias, de acordo com a legislação : a) doença mental (transtornos mentais grave s, como transtornos psicóticos, transtornos orgânicos de personalidade e quadros neurodegenerativos); b) desenvolvimento mental retardado (quadros de retardo mental e transtornos invasivos do desenvolvimento); c) perturbação da saúde mental (transtornos mentais de menor gravidade, sem sintomas psicóticos, transtornos de personalidade e transtornos do impulso); e d) dependência (transtornos relacionados ao uso de substâncias graves como síndrome de dependência e transtornos psicóticos, agudos ou tardios, induzidos por substâncias psicoativas) (ABDALLA -FILHO, TELLES, et al. , 2016, TABORDA, 2001) . As três primeiras categorias (“a”, “b” e “c”) são previstas no Art. 26 do código penal, como mencionado acima. A última categoria “d” se encontra na Lei n° 11.343/06, em seu Art. 45, cuja redação segue os moldes do Art. 26 no seu Caput e Parágrafo único (ABDALLA -FILHO, TELLES, et al. , 2016) .", "O nexo de causalidade corresponde a correlação entre os determinantes clínicos (sintomas ativos) do transtorno mental diagnosticado e sua correlação com o delito praticado. Em outras palavras, na avaliação do nexo de causalidade o perito deve verificar se os sintomas ativos do diagnóstico psiquiátrico foram causa determinante do desfecho, ou seja, do delito praticado (ABDALLA -FILHO, TELLES, et al. , 2016, HUNGR IA, FRAGOSO, 1983, TABORDA, 2001) . É comum verificar correlação entre sintomas ativos de um diagnóstico psiquiátrico e a práti ca de um delito, entretanto, ess es devem ser suficientes para prejudicar as capacidades de entendimento e de determinação, como será exposto a seguir.", "As capacidades de entendimento e de determinação correspondem, respectivamente, aos elementos cognitivo e volitivo da ação delitiva e são o cerne da avaliação psiquiátrico -forense de RC (ABDALLA -FILHO, TELLES, et al. , 2016, TABORDA, 2001) . A principal pesquisa teórica em psicopatologia forense no tema traz uma análise detalhada, criteriosa, filosófica e fenomenológica, dos elementos psicopatológicos inerentes a esse tipo de avaliação (CHALUB, 1981) . Esse trabalho permanece sendo referência aos psiquiatras forense que trabalham perícias de RC e foi utilizado em na elaboração do modelo teórico adotado na Escala de Imputabilidade Penal (EIP), que foi desenvolvida e validada em noss a pesquisa (artigo 3) . Por fim, o critério cronológico avalia se todos os outros critérios mencionados acima estiveram presentes, de maneira concomitante, ao tempo da ação delitiva. Em outras palavras, o critério cronológico se refere à temporalidade na qual a ação delitiva se desenvolve u (ABDALLA -FILHO, TELLES, et al. , 2016, CHALUB, 1981, TABORDA, A conclusão da perícia de RC pode ser de três tipos, de acordo com a legislação brasileira: imputável, semi -imputável ou inimputável (ABDALLA -FILHO, TELLES, et al., 2016, TABORDA, 2001) . O indivíduo é considerado imputável (inteiramente responsável pela prática do delito) quando, ao tempo dos fatos praticados, apresentava suas capacidades de entendimento e de determinação inteiramente preservadas (TABORDA, 2001) . O indivíduo é considerado semi -imputável (parcialmente responsável pela prática do delito) quando, ao tempo dos fatos p raticados, apresentava suas capacidades de entendimento e/ou de determinação parcialmente prejudicadas (TABORDA, 2001) . Por fim, o indivíduo é conside rado inimputável (sem responsabilidade pela prática do delito) quando apresentava, ao tempo dos fatos", "praticados, suas capacidades de entendimento e/ou de determinação inteiramente prejudicadas (TABORDA, 2001) .", "1.2.2 – Avaliação de responsabilidade criminal nas jurisprudências de outros países A avaliação de reponsabilidade penal varia de acordo com as legislações vigentes em diferentes países e jurisdições. Nos Estados Unidos da América (EUA) existem duas jurisdições para a perícia de responsabilidade criminal: o M'Naghten Rule e o American Law Institute Model Penal Rule (ALI) (AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PSYCHIATRY AND THE LAW (AAPL), JANOFSKY, et al. , 2014, FELTHOUS, 2010, MEYNEN, 2020, NIVEAU, SOZONETS, 2001, ROSNER, SCOTT, 2017) . Na primeira, é avaliada apenas a capacidade de entendimento do indivíduo infrator em relação à prática delituosa (ROSNER , SCOTT, 2017) . Na segunda, são avaliadas as capacidades de entendimento e de determinação do indivíduo infrator, em relação à prátic a delituosa (AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PSYCHIATRY AND THE LAW (AAPL), JANOF SKY, et al. , 2014) . Em ambas, a conclusão pericial pode ser de dois tipos: o infrator pode ser considerado totalmente responsável (imputabilidade) ou ter sua reponsabilidade criminal anulada (inimputabilidade ). Nessas jurisdições não são previstos graus intermediários de responsabilidade criminal (semi -imputabil idade). P aíses como a Argentina, o Chile, o El Salvador e o Uruguai também não preveem a possibilidade de semi -imputabilidade em suas jurisdições (ABDALLA -FILHO, TELLES, et al. , 2016) .", "Existem países que adotam em suas jurisdições graus intermediários de responsabilidade criminal na conclusão pericial. Entre os países latino -americanos, a Bolívia, a Colômbia, a Costa Rica, a República de Cuba, o México, a Nicarágua, o Panamá, o Peru e o Porto Rico, prevee m a possibilidade de graus intermediários de responsabilidade criminal (semi -imputabilidade) em suas jurisdições (ABDA LLA - FILHO, TELLES, et al. , 2016) . Vale destacar a existência de países com mais de um grau intermediário de responsabilidade criminal , como a Espanha (dois graus intermediários de semi -imputabilidade) e a Alemanha (com três graus intermediários de semi - imputabilidade) (MOHÍNO, PUJOL, et al. , 2011, SPAANS, BARENDREGT, et al. ,", "Há grande variabilidade nas possíveis conclusões quanto a RC e das terminologias legais entre as diferentes jurisdições. Tal fato evidencia a complexidade do tema, assim como a dificuldade de interlocução e correspondência precisa entre a PF e o direito criminal (CROCKER, CÔTÉ, 2009, MAOZ, YAFFE, 2015, MEYNEN, 2012, TOR RY, BILLICK, 2010) . Esses temas serão explorados nos artigos 3 e 4 da presente tese. 1.2.3 – Capacidades legais na responsabilidade criminal e psicopatologia forense As capacidades legais (CL) podem ser definidas como construtos psicopatológicos específicos previstos em lei que demandam a avaliação técnica por expert na matéria (psiquiatra forense) à sua verificação (ABDALLA -FILHO, TELLES, et al. , 2016, CHALUB, 1981, ROSNER, SCOTT, 2017) . A demanda jurídica por CL no âmbito criminal emerge a necessidade angariar, em seu saber doutrinário, definições relativas às capacidades psíquicas de entendimento ético -jurídico e d e autogoverno de um agente, frente ao cometimento de um ato ilícito (BUCHANAN, 201 5, HUNGRIA, FRAGOSO, 1983) . Nesse sentido, condiciona (indeclinavelmente) a combinação de fatores biológicos e psíquicos na sua definição. Isto se dá por arbítrio próprio do saber jurídico, dado que – seja por de limitação do seu horizonte científico ou por diletante ecletismo – não costuma , previamente, buscar o entendimento de outras áreas do conhecimento para elaborar as definições conceituais que necessita, mesmo sem dominá - las por completo, como se dá com a definição das CL (PEIXOTO, 1935) . Ao revés, define as CL a priori conforme suas próprias noções e, a posteriori , demanda ao expert na matéria (o psiquiatra) sua verificação e a resolução de eventuais dificuldades técnicas inerentes às suas próprias definições (PEIXOTO, 1935) . Esses elementos foram determinantes para a realização da pesquisa dessa tese.", "Os postulados que definem e justificam o entendimento jurídico de RC e CL se originam de conceitos filosóficos que constituíram as bases do direito cr iminal ocidental contemporâneo (HUNGRIA, FRAGOSO, 1983, PEIXOTO, 1935) . A composição prática desses conceitos partiram de noções extremadas e, por conseguinte, inconciliáveis, relativas à noção de devir do ser -humano: o l ivre-arbítrio e o determi nismo (HUNGRIA, FRAGOSO, 1983, PEIXOTO, 1935) . Estas noções podem ser compreendidas através de perspectivas filosóficas: o primeiro por uma interpretação tipicamen te agostiniana e o segundo por uma in terpretação spenceriana (HUNGRIA, FRAGOSO, 1983, PEIXOTO, 1935) . Ambas as perspectivas são também equidistantes do pensamento científico atual,", "que deve prevalecer para a compreensão das CL e pratica pericial. Entretanto, a influência (não conciliadora) de ambas as correntes é atual na psiquiatria clínica e forense, d ada a existência de linhas de pesquisa também extremadas: ora tendenciosas ao puro determinismo neurobiológico (MISKOVICH, ANDE RSON, et al. , 2018) , ora à relativização (ou moralização) dos aspectos relacionados à psicopatologia forense (SINNOTT -ARMSTRONG, 2008) . Em ambos os casos, são negligenciados os aspectos fundamentais da psicopatologia clássi ca e do método fenomenológico (JASPERS, 1968, MEYER, TABORDA, et al. , 2015, PARNAS, SASS, et al. , 2013) .", "Como um breve adendo introdutório dessa tese de doutorado, é oportuno frisar que a PF permanece como o principal representante da psicopatologia clássica na psiquiatria (CHALUB, 1981) . O argumento se justifica dado que, nessa subárea de atuação , a psicopatologia é utilizada de maneira pura e aplicada nos seus moldes clássicos, com o uso do mét odo fenomenológico à análise de cada caso singular. Na PF, não há uma busca incessante por marcadores biológicos ou de neurotransmissão, como se dá na psiquiatra clínica contemporânea. Reduzir a psicopato logia a esses elementos seria o equivalente a reduzir o fenômeno psíquico à aspectos neuroanatômicos e /ou neurofisiológicos, sem considerar elementos próprios de sua natureza objetual (JASPERS, 1968) . Esse argumento não diminui a relevância a evidência neurobiológica na psiquiatria clínica ou PF , que sempre deve ser considerad a quando identificável. Na PF, argumentos exclusivamente neurobiológicos têm caracte rísticas semelhantes a linhas de pensamento behavioristas ao pretenderem eliminar aspectos elementos inerentes aos rendimentos psicopatológicos subjetivos (JASPERS, 1968) . Esses, juntamente com os rendimentos psicopatológicos objetivos, são conceituados, reunidos , organizados e hierarquizados através do “Todo momentâneo psíquico ” descrito por Jaspers (JASPERS, No Brasil, o principal estudo em psicopa tologia forense buscou reunir noções filosóficas, filológicas, se mânticas e de direito comparado relativas às CL, a fim de organizar sua compreensão através de conceitos psicopatológicos, nos moldes daqueles classicamente adotados no exame psiquiátrico clínico (CHALUB, 1981) . O trabalho desenvolveu, nos moldes da psicopatologia clássica, a descrição e conceituação de 64 rendimentos psicopatológicos específicos à definição das CL de entendimento e determinação, conforme p revistas no Código Penal (CHALUB, 1981) . Esse trabalho permanece como o principal modelo teórico aplicado por psiquiatras f orenses nas", "avaliações responsabilidade criminal (ABDALLA -FILHO, TELLES, et al. , 2016, É fundamental reconhecer a importância do trabalho de Chalub na psicopatologia forense (CHALUB, 1981 ). Tal fato se verifica pela sua agudeza, exatidão e rigor técnico ao realizar o escrutínio fenomenológico dos construtos psicopatológicos que compõem as CL previstas no Código Penal (CHALUB, 1981) . Um ponto de destaque nesse trabalho, são os comentários semânticos e linguísticos referentes à definição das CL do autor na obra, que foram determinantes para o desenvolviment o da metodologia adotada na EIP.", "1.2.4 – Instrumentos psicométricos na prática forense O us o de instrumentos psicométricos trouxe avanços significativos à prática da PF. Os IPs aplicados na PF podem se r divididos em três grupos: a) instrumentos psicométrico s aplicados na prática clínica, b) instrumentos psicométricos aplicados na prática clínica com relevância forense, e c) instrumentos psicométricos especificamente desenvolvidos à prática forense (EL-SHENAWY, 2019, ROSNER, SCO TT, 2017, No primeiro grupo (a) estão instrumentos psicométricos especificamente desenvolvidos à prática clínica e que apresentam aplicabilidade forense, por abordarem elementos clínicos fundamentais ao raciocínio pericial, em casos específicos. O mini exame do estado mental (MEEM), a Escala Wechsler de Inteligência pa ra Adultos 4ed (WAIS -IV) e o Inventário de Avaliação de Perso nalidade (PAI), são exemplos desse grupo (ROSNER, SCOTT, 2017) .", "No segundo grupo (b) estão instrumentos psicométricos desenvolvidos à prática forense que abordam elementos clínicos de maior relevância ou intere sse pericial. O Psychopathic Checklist Revised (PCL -R) e o Historical, Clinical and Management 20 (HCR -20) são exemplos desse grupos e estão entre os mais utilizados na prática forense (MORANA, ARBOLEDA -FLÓREZ, et al. , 2005, TELLES, DAY, et al. , 2009) . O HCR - 20 e o PCL -R foram utilizados no presente trabalho e são mais detalhados nos art igos 1 e 4, respectivamente .", "Em especial, o HCR -20 é validado para aplicação em populações psiquiátricas clínicas e pode ser utilizado em ambientes ambulatoriais, hospitalares e de emergência . Sua aplicação em pacientes mais propensos a manifestarem comportamento violento possibilita a identificação de fatores risco específicos ( clínicos e ambientais ) relacionados ao risco de violência, proteção de possíveis vítimas de desfechos violentos , no delineamento de planos terapêuticos com o foco no risco de violência e evitação de desfechos de maior gravidade e de repercussão forense, como por exemplo, criminal (comportamento violento que configure um ato delitivo) (GARCIA -MANSILLA, PH, et al., 2011, MCDERMOTT, EDENS, et al. , 2008, TENGSTRÖM, 2001) . O HCR -20 é utilizado em populações forenses na maioria dos estudos , sendo pouco pesquisado em populações clínicas, como realizamos no estudo 1 (GARCIA -MANSILLA, PH, et al. , No terceiro grupo (c) estão instrumentos psicométricos especificamente desenvolvidos à avaliação forense de CL. Em outras palavras, nesse grupo estão incluídos os instrumentos psicométricos que buscam por avaliar competências legais específicas. Por exemplo, o Roger Criminal Responsibility Scale (R -CRAS), o MacArthur Competence Assessment Tool - Criminal Adjudication (MacCAT -CA) e o MacArthur Competence Assessment Tool –Treatment (MacCAT -T), foram desenvolvidos para a avaliação de CL (AKINKUNMI, 2002, CAIRNS, MADDO CK, et al. , 2005, HOGE, BONNIE, et al. , 1997, JACOBS, RYBA, et al. , 2008, LAN, WU, et al. , 2013, MARTIN, HICKERSON, 2013, MCDERMOTT, GERBASI, et al. , 2005, OTTO, POYTHRESS, et al., 1998, RAYMONT, BUCHANAN, et al. , 2007, ROGERS, Richard, JOHANSSON - LOVE, 200 9, ROGERS, Richard, SEMAN, et al. , 1986, RUTLEDGE, KENNEDY, et al., 2008, SANTOS, SOUSA, et al. , 2017, ZAPF, GOLDING, et al. , 2005) .

Nesse sentido, no ssa pesquisa buscou esclarecer as possibilidades e os limites técnicos da psicopatologia forense e de instrumentos psicométricos na identificação dos graus intermediários de responsabilidade criminal previstos no Código Penal (artigo 3 e 4) (ABDALLA -FILHO, 2017, MOHÍNO, PUJOL, et al. , 2011, SPAANS, BARENDREGT, et al. , 2011, ST.DENIS, SEPÚLVEDA, A verificação de graus intermediários de responsabilidade criminal é um elemento limítrofe da técnica pericial.

A ausência de graus intermediários de responsabilidade criminal em determinadas jurisdiç ões (como por exemplo na M’Nagthen rule) elimina essa dificuldade de avaliação, resumindo a duas as possíveis conclusões periciais: imputável e inimputável. Entretanto, a aparente simplificação da avali ação de RP pode negligenciar aspectos psiquiátrico -forenses relevantes à justiça, capazes de contribuir ao melhor encaminhamento jurídico de casos que envolvam indivíduos infratores com o diagnóstico de transtorno mental (ABDALLA -FILHO, TELLES, et al. , 2016) . 1.3 – Objetivos Este trabalho tem como objetivo buscar esclarecimentos ao seguinte questionamento: quais os critérios de cientificidade mais apropriados aos rendimentos psicopatológicos subjetivos?", "1.3.1 – Objetivos específicos 1 – Pesquisar as características de comportamento violento em uma amostra de pacientes com esquizofrenia internados em uma enfermaria de emergência em um hospital clínico da cidade do Rio de Janeiro.", "2 – Realizar uma revisão sistemática para buscar fatores que justifiquem a elevada divergência entre peritos na avaliação de um mesmo caso de perícia criminal. 3 – Desenvolver e validar um IP para a verificação das capacidades de entendimento e de determinação no exame de responsabilidade criminal.", "4 – Realizar um estudo do perfil criminal, clínico e do grau de psicopatia em uma amostra de réus submetidos ao exame de RC no Rio de Janeiro.", "2 - Desenvolvimento Artigo 1: Schizophrenia and violence: a study in a general psychiatric hospital with HCR - 20 and MOAS", "Artigo 2: How to explain forensic psychiatric experts’ disagreement in the same criminal case?

Method: Based on the PRISMA guidelines, we searched the following keywords with Boolean operators: (criminal responsibility OR legal responsibility OR neurolaw OR insanity defense) AND (forensic psychiatry OR assessment OR evaluation OR bias OR decision - making OR capacity OR psychometric). The search included publications from January 1998 to December 2019 in the English language, published in PubMed, Web of Science, Taylor & Francis, and Scopus databases. Results: The final sample consisted of 30 articles separat ed into three groups: (1) legal elements and the wording of expert reports, (2) psychometric tools applied to criminal inquiries, and (3) expert forensic technique and inter -examiner agreement. Discussion: Multiple factors for biases were identified: diffi culties in equivalence between legal and psychiatric terminologies, elements of countertransference between the expert and the examinee, absence of standardization of expert evaluations, low quality of expert reports, differences in the training of profess ionals involved in the evaluations, use of psychometric tools, number of professionals working on the same case, and the methodology adopted. Psychometric tools developed specifically for forensic psychiatric evaluations allowed the introduction of objecti ve parameters in expert evaluations. Special attention was found in psychometric tools structured as vignettes that allowed the detailed evaluation of legal capacities, present in the legal texts. Psychometric tools in checklist format appeared to be more susceptible to interviewer biases. Conclusion: The control of inherent biases in forensic psychiatry on criminal matters remains a current challenge, difficult to control in forensic practice. The identification of elements to orient forensic psychiatric e valuations and psychometric tools developed specifically for the evaluation of legal capacities can contribute to the control of biases in forensic psychiatric reports.", "Key words: criminal responsibility, legal capacities, assessment, bias, decision -makin g, opinion.", "1- Introduction Forensic psychiatry (FP) is a specific area of psychiatry’s intersection with legal sciences (Rosner & Scott, 2017) . The production of forensic medical documents (reports and expert opinions) is one of the principal tasks of FP (Resnick & Soliman, 2012; Rosner, Scott, 2017) . However, recent studies have highlighted the poor quality of psychiatric reports submitted to criminal courts and the lack of agreement between examiners when evaluating the same c ase (Fuger, Acklin, Nguyen, Ignacio, & Gowensmith, 2014; Kacperska, Heitzman, Bak, Leśko, & Opio, 2016; Robinson & Acklin, 2010) . These findings underscore the vulnerability of the technical characteristics and scientific standards of forensic psychiatric reports, indicating a crisis of credibility in contemporary FP (Guivarch et al., 2017) .", "This scenario illustrates the complexity of adapting FP assessments to other medical specialties’ scientific standards (Meyer et al., 2015; Rosn er & Scott, 2017) . The development of diagnostic tests with high sensitivity and specificity, such as laboratory and imaging tests, allows diagnostic confirmation in non -psychiatric medical specialties (Meyer et al., 2015; Rosner & Scott, 2017) . The lack of these gold standard tests in psychiatry shows the limits of categorical and objective diagnosis in this specialty, in which scientific c riteria are still essentially clinical (Fuchs, 2013; Jaspers, 1968; Meyer The explanation for the high disagreement between experts on the same case under analysis is complex and involves consideration of var ious simultaneous factors in forensic psychiatric practice (Buchanan, 2015) . The way forensic psychiatric data were obtained by the expert, the report’s wording, performance of structured evalu ations, use of psychometric tools (PT), the expert’s experience and professional background, the demand for reports, and countertransference elements in the forensic setting are possible causes of such biases (Buchanan , 2015; Freedman & Woods, 2018; Guivarch et al., 2017; Mossière & Maeder, 2015) . However, it is still not known how these variables correlate. The biases’ interference in expert evaluations poses a relevant and current technical and scientific challenge for FP (Freedman & Woods, 2018; Guivarch et al., 2017) . The high rate of inter -examiner di sagreement challenges the scientific basis of the criteria applied to forensic psychiatric reasoning and conclusions in this setting and tends (mistakenly) to equate such criteria with the expert’s personal opinion or argument of authority (Fuger et al., 2014; Kacperska et al., 2016; Robinson & Acklin, 2010) . This tends to equate the scientific standard of forensic psychiatry to the reasoning in the", "underlying legal criteria applied by judges and lawyers, whose modus operandi (alth ough factual and probatory) operates by persuasion or established jurisprudence (Freedman & Woods, 2018) . The judges’ goal of impartiality when drafting legal rulings and sentences has been studied scientifically and remains a persistently elusive ideal, given the observation of biases that reveal elements of influenceability in the criteria adopted by the lega l field (Angermeyer & Dietrich, 2006; Angermeyer & Matschinger, 2005; Mossière & Maeder, 2015) . However, such biases should not be confused with the inherent biases of forensic psychiatric evaluations per se , which are the current article’s focus.", "The article’s main objectives are to verify the principal factors associated with disagreement between examiners in forensic psychiatric evaluations of the same individual criminal case and alternatives for avoiding such biases. 2- Method This systemat ic review was carried out according to PRISMA guidelines and was registered in Prospero with the number CRD42020192777 . Four electronic databases were searched PubMed, Web of Science, Taylor & Francis, and Scopus databases , over the past 20 years . The following Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) terms were searched with Booleans operators: (criminal responsibility OR legal responsibility OR neurolaw OR insanity defense) AND (forensic psychiatry OR assessment OR evaluation OR bias OR decision making OR capacity OR psychometric) . The search was completed by 31 December 2019. The two authors conducted the search .", "2.1- Eligibility criteria Studies that assessed the relationship between divergences in psychiatric or psychological expertise in the same ca se analyzed and possible bias factors were included in the review. The inclusion criteria were the following: (1) articles that mentioned in the abstract, as the main objective, of possible bias factors in forensic assessments conducted by psychiatric and/or psychologist experts ; (2) articles that mentioned in the abstract divergent conclusion in forensic assessmen ts based on psychometric tools; (3) articles that mentioned in the abstract factors regarding forensic techniques to explain divergences betw een experts in the same case analyzed.", "The following types of articles were included: editorials, systematic reviews, meta -analyses, original studies, and book reviews. The final sample excluded articles not related to this review’s objectives and that addressed aspects pertaining to the jury t rial", "or that exclusively biased the reasoning of judges, jurors, and lawyers. We excluded case reports and duplicate articles and only included publications in English. 2.2- Study selection and data extraction The initial sample included 7,224 articles i n English. All the titles and abstracts were read, selecting those that included themes related to disagreement in evaluations performed by psychiatrists or psychologists or that used psychometric parameters. The full texts of the selected articles (n=65) were read, selecting those in which the methodology and results addressed the systematic review’s objectives. The final sample consisted of 30 articles. The data extraction was performed by the first author, and after rechecked by the second author. The fl owchart summarizes the article selection resulting in the final sample (Figure 1) .", "3- Results The results pointed to different factors potentially interfering as biases in forensic expertise conclusions . The final sample consisted of 30 articles , and was divided into 3 groups according to e ach article’s content , in order to better organize the sample (Table 1). The groups were divided according to the principal themes addressed in the articles: legal factors, psychometric indicators in the expert evaluation, and forensic technique. 3.1- Legal factors", "Group 1 included the articles that addressed legal aspects (n=13) (Table 1). The main themes in this group were: difficulty in establishing equivalence between legal and psychiatric terminologies, disagreements between expert reports, possible contributions by neurosciences to expert evaluations, and quality of the reports’ wording. The concept of “capacity” was mentioned as central to forensic psychiatric evaluations (Buchanan, 2015) . More than one article cited the lack of consensus in the definition of this concept (Buchanan, 2 015; Lacroix et al. 2017; Meynen, 2012) . This group also included legislations specifically developed to clarify FP and experts’ demands (Lacroix et al., 2017; Meynen, 2012) . For example, an article from Canada suggested the incorporation of specific legislation (called “Bill C -14”) for criminal responsibility (CR) according to psychiatric evalua tions (Table 1) (Lacroix et al., 2017) . The application of other ethically -based theoretical constructs was suggested as an alternative for elucidating the legal concept of “capacity”, in order to improve the technical assessment of criminal responsibility (Table 1) (Meynen, 2012) . The lack of precise equivalence between legal texts and psychia tric terminology was identified as a possible source of bias in CR evaluations (Joubert & van Staden, 2016; McSherry, 2004; Meynen, 2013; O’Sullivan, 2018) . Clinical presentations with psychopathologic al characteristics not contemplated in legal texts, such as autism, motor automatisms (chorea -like conditions), parasomnias, and transient states of consciousness (sleep -wake cycle), were cited as challenging situations for forensic practice (Joubert & van Staden, 2016; McSherry, 2004; Meynen, 2013) . These clinical presentations were described as “borderline”, given th e limitations in establishing equivalences between the clinical condition (or diagnosis) and legal terminologies (McSherry, 2004; Meynen, The forensic psychiatric (or psychological) evaluation complemented with neuroscientific evidence (e.g., neuroimaging tests) was suggested as a possible technical improvement to the evaluation of legal capacity (Penney, 2012; Schleim, 2012) . The lack of clear correspondence between the clinical diagnosis (the biological element) and legal terminology, indispensable for verifying legal capacitie s such as capacity for understanding and capacity for self -determination, could be resolved through neuroscientific evidence (the neuroanatomical element) (Penney, 2012; Schleim, 2012) . The identification of neuroanatomical elements and the precise correspond ence with legal capacities (when possible) would allow adding objective parameters to forensic psychiatric evaluations in this context (Penney, 2012; Schleim, 2012) .", "Updating traditional concepts in FP, such as psychopathy, was cited as a factor that could he lp decrease countertransference biases and theoretical prejudices in forensic psychiatric evaluations (Felthous, 2010) . Contemporary psychiatry acknowledges the presence of psychopathological characteristics in different clinical presentations, but without relevant repercussions for judges and lawyers or in forensic practice (Felthous, 2010) . This clinical variations w as incorporated by the alternative model for diagnosis of personality disorders in the 5th edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM 5) (Hopwood, Thomas, Markon, Wright, & Krueger, 2012) .", "The low technical quality and high disagreement between expert reports submitted to criminal justice on individual cases are limitations to forensic ps ychiatric practice (Fuger et al., 2014; Kacperska et al., 2016) . Reports on CR submitted to the courts in Hawaii (150 expert reports pertaining to 50 cases) produced by three examiners, who were psychologists and ps ychiatrists , from 2006 to 2010, were anal yzed with a 43 -item quality -coding instrument to verify the documents’ quality standards. Each item in this instrument scores “0” when incomplete, “1” if it contains partial information, and “2” if it contains complete information (Fuger et al., 2014) . Thirty -three items from the quality - coding instrument were used to compare cases of criminal insanity, in which the total score varied from 0 to 66 (Fuger et al., 2014) . Cases of criminal insanity considered 37 items (four additional items referring to danger to others), with the score varying from 0 to 74. The instrument’s seven other items were not useful for the comparison of expert reports (Fuger et al., 2014) .", "In the final sample (n=50) in this sa me study, consensus among the three examiners was reached in 46% of the cases (n=23) (Fuger et al., 2014) .6 In 52% of the cases (n=26), representing 78 reports, two examiners agreed on the conclusions (Fuger et al., 2014) . Only one case (2% of the sample) showed disagreement among all three examiners (Fuger et al., 2014) . Inter -examiner agreement was considered “weak” (ICC<0.6), independently of professional background (psychiatrist or psychologist) (Fuger et al., 2014) . Consensus among the examiners and the court occurred in 40.8% of cases (n=20) (Fuger et al., 2014) . Lack of standardization of the documents, variation in forensic reasoning, and poor quality of the documents’ wording favored high disagreement between the reports submitted to the courts (Fuger et al., 2014) . A Polish study analyzed agreement between expert reports (n=381) pertaining to 117 cases submitted to forensic psychia tric evaluation (Kacperska et al., 2016) . Of these,", "68 cases were evaluated by more than one professi onal (forensic psychiatrists or psychologists) (Kacperska et al., 2016) . Two evaluations were perform ed in 41 cases, three evaluations in 17 cases, four evaluations in eight cases, and five evaluations in two cases (Kacperska et al., 2016) . A proportional correlation was found between the number of evaluations and the number of divergent expert reports (r=0.51) (Kacperska et al., 2016) . In only 36 cases (among the 68 that were evaluated more than once), the expert conclusion was not altered by subsequent evaluations (Kacperska et al., 2016) . Meanwhile, among the 32 cases in whic h there was disagreement, in 22 cases from the total sample (18.8%) the expert conclusion was altered once, in eight cases (6.8%) the expert conclusion was altered twice, and in two cases (1.7%) the expert conclusion was altered three times (Kacperska et al., 2016) . Lack of access to the content of the previous reports was identified as the main determina nt of this outcome (Kacperska et al., 2016) . The use of hyperbolic clinical wording and lack of stand ardization of the expert reports and of equivalence between clinical and legal terminology were identified as factors for inter -examiner disagreement on the same cases, as well as between the court ruling and the forensic psychiatric conclusion (Slovenko, 1999) . The use of non -scientific expressions or those denoting clinical severity (e.g., “mental defect” versus “mental disorder”) tended to fav or court rulings of compulsory treatment and disagreement between examiners (Slovenko, 1999) .", "3.2- Psychometric tools in forensic evaluation This group included studies that used PTs in forensic psychiatric evaluations (Table 1). The PTs in this group can be subdivided into three subgroups: PTs specifically developed for forensic psychiatry (called “forensic assessment techniques”), PTs based on clinical psychiatric elements with high relevance for FP (“forensically relevant assessment techniques”), and PTs largely applied in clinical psychiatric assessments useful in FP (“clinical assessment techniques”) (Advokat, Guidry, Burnett, Manguno - Mire, & Thompson, 2012; Cai et al., 2014; Hilton, Simpson, & Ham, 2016; Murrie, Boccaccini, Johnson, & Janke, 2008; Rogers, Seman, & Clark, 1986; Rogers & Sewell, In our review, the subgroup “forensic assessment techniques” included PTs applied to the assessment of psychopathological legal capacities (Rosner & Scott, 2017) . PTs to evaluate competence to stand trial (CST) and CR were included in this subgroup (Akinkunmi, 2002; Cai et al., 2014; Rogers et al., 1986; Rogers & Sewell, 1999) . CST", "assesses whether the defendant displays discernment concerning his or her legal status and the trial’s conseq uences at that moment (cross -sectional evaluation) (Akinkunmi, 2002) . When clinical elements for discernment are impaired, the defendant is submitted to compulsory psychiatric treatment until obtaining satisfactory clinical improvement in order to be prosecuted (Advokat et al., 2012; Akinkunmi, 2002) . Criminal responsibility assesses whether the individual, at the ti me the offense was committed, was able to comprehend the act’s illegality and to practice self -determination based on this comprehension (retrospective evaluation) (Cai et al., 2014; Rogers et al., 1986; Rogers & CST assessments are typically employed in Anglo -Saxon jurisdictions (Akinkunmi, 2002) . An ex ample of a PT developed for this purpose and widely applied in the United States is the MacArthur Competence Assessment Tool -Criminal Adjudication, which is structured in clinical vignettes with questions and answers focused on legal competencies (Akinkunmi, 2002) . This PT was also validated in the United Kingdom, where it was called MacArthur Fitness to Plead (Akinkunmi, 2002) . This cross - cultural validation did not find statistical significance in the comparison of the instrument’s score with the expert conclusion (Akinkunmi, 2002) . However, the study highlighted the inherent difficulty in psychometric evaluation of psychopathological constructs pertaining to legal competencies without considering clinical elements (e.g., presence of delusions and hallucinations) or criminal dynamics (use of weapons in the crime, type of crime), as with PTs structured in checklists. An example of this kind of PT is the Georgia Court Competence Test ( GCCT) , which is structured as a 21 -item checklist divided into sections (Advokat et al., 2012) . The sections evaluate the defendant’s capacity to visually perceive the representation of a hearing room, receive the defense attorney’s assistance, and answer questions aimed at verifying potential malingering or consciou s simulation (Table 1) (Advokat et al., 2012) .", "Our revie w included two studies with PTs developed for the evaluation of CR: the Rogers Criminal Responsibility Assessment Scales (R -CRAS) and the rating scale of criminal responsibility for mentally disordered offenders (Cai et al., 2014; Rogers et al., 1986; Rogers & Sewell, 1999) . Both are structured on checklists completed by the examiner with clinical impressions of the forensic examination and prior data, such as official records of the crime or medical documents. The Rogers Criminal Responsibility Assessment Scales feature a 25 -item inventory (clinical data related to the examiner’s opinion), subdivided into six cardinal domains: malingering, organicity, major mental", "illness, cognitive control, behavior control and causal nexus (Rogers et al., 1986; Rogers & Sewell, 1999) . The item scores vary from 0 to 5 or 6. A score of 0 is assigned when there is no available information to complete the item. A score of 1 means absence of the characteristic. Scores of 2 or more indicate presence of the characteristic with increasing and directly proportional severity (Rogers et al., 1986; Rogers & Sewell, 1999) . Validation studies on the Rogers Criminal Responsibility Assessment Scale found that the six cardinal domains of the instrument share some clinical items (Rogers & Sewell, 1999) . The main clinical items with statistical significance share d by the majority of the domains was: observable bizarre behavior, awareness of criminality , level of verbal coherence, examiner’s assessment of patient’s self -control, and relationship of loss of control to psychosis . These results point to similarities between the domains and limitations in their individualization (Rogers & Sewell, 1999) . Some items were more significant for the forensic conclusion (Rogers & Sewell, 1999) . Comparison of the R - CRAS result to the expert’s opinion showed statistical significance (p<0.01) (Table 1). The rating scale of criminal responsibility for mentally disordered offenders includes various non -psychopathological items (Cai et al., 2014) . This PT consists of 18 items: criminal motivation; aura before the crime; inducement to crime; time, space, object, and tool selected for the crime; emotion during the crime; shirking after the crime; concealing the truth during the interview; malingering; understanding the nature of the crime; understanding the consequence of the crime; impairment of life skills; impairment to learning at work; impaired insight; impaired judgment of reality; and impaired self - control (Cai et al., 2014) . Each item’s score varies from 0 to 4, according to absence (score 0) o r presence of the characteristic (score of 4 for the highest degree) (Cai et al., 2014) . The rating scale of criminal responsibility for mentally disordered offenders was validated retrospectively through expert reports and showed statistically significant results (p<0.01) (Table 1 ).", "In our review, the subgroup of forensically relevant assessment techniques includes psychometric instruments to evaluate the risk of violence. These tools assess the probabilistic risk of violent behavior in an individual (with or without mental disorder) who has previously committed an offense (prospective evaluation) (Hilton et al., 2016; Murrie et al., 2008) . Studies to assess the risk of violence have applied different PTs, such as: Historical Clinical Risk Management -20 (HCR -20), Violence Risk Appraisal Guide (VRAG), Psychopathic Checklist Revised (PCL -R), and Alabama S tructured Assessment of Treatment Completion (AlaSATcom) (Table 1) (Hilton et al., 2016; Hooper,", "McLearen, & Barnett, 2005; Murrie et al., 2008) . In common, all these PTs assess the risk of violent behavior in individuals with diagnosis of mental disorder or psychopathic personality traits.", "Specifically, the PCL -R was mentioned as a source of disagreement among examiners in the same case (Murrie et al., 2008 ). The comparison of the PCL -R scores by two independent examiners representing opposing parties in a court case (prosecution versus defense) revealed high disagreement (Murrie et al., 2008) . Most of the results showed large disc repancies, with disagreement greater than 6.0 points in more than 60% of the cases (total 23). There was agreement between the examiners’ total scores in two cases (Murrie et al., 2008) . The PCL -R scores in studies on inter -examiner disagreement in violence risk assessment differed from those in a validation study on this PT (Table 1). Finally, the group of clinical assessment techniques featured PTs widely used in clinical practice, such as the DSM 5 (BPRS), Mini Mental State Exam ( MMSE), and Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) (Advokat e t al., 2012) . The PTs in the subgroups “forensically relevant assessment techniques”, and “clinical assessment techniques” were mainly used to support clinical decisions to discharge patients from psychiatric hospitals or for verification of defendants’ competence to stand trial. The use of these PTs in the expert reports varied from simply citing them to performing a complete application of the PT with a total score (Table 1).", "3.3- Forensic technique This group included the articles that addressed topic s on forensic technique, such as: disagreement between examiners on the same case, factors capable of introducing biases in forensic techniques, and the adaptation of theoretical models from clinical psychiatry to forensic psychiatry. Violence risk assessm ent was the most common type of study in this group (Table 1).", "Agreement between three examiners on discharging patients from compulsory psychiatric hospitalization showed varied results, generally with insufficient levels of agreement (Neil Gowensmith, Murrie, Boccaccini, & McNichols, 2017) . In one study, the three examiners were unanimous on 53 .2% of the cases (r=0.35) (Neil Gowensmith et al., 2017) . In a three -year period, patients that underwent violence risk assessment showed lower rates of hospital readmissi on (29.6%) when the examiners were unanimous, compared to hospital readmission when there was disagreement (70.4%) (Table 1) (Neil Gowensmith et al., 2017) .", "The opinions of psychiatrists and psychologists in releasing mentally ill offenders from temporary custodial treatment was compared in another study (Stredny, Parker, & Dibble, 2012 ). Psychiatrists and psychologists frequently recommend hospitalization of patients in the following situations: history of suicide attempts or self -inflicted injury; family or other psychosocial issues; lack of structured activities in the community; a nd individuals admitted to hospital directly from prison (Stredny et al., 2012) . Psychiatrists were more likely to recommend hospitalization of patients with substance use disorders. Meanwhile, psyc hologists were more likely to recommend hospitalization of patients that used weapons when committing the offense (Stredny et al., 2012) .", "In our sample, the reliability of PTs developed for violenc e risk assessment (like PCL-R) had lower rates than in their validation studies (Table 1) (Murrie et al., 2008) . Disparate scores on the application of PCL -R by different examiners in the same case indicate the effect of biases on t he scores with these PTs, for example, in relation to the type of crime committed (Murrie et al., 2008) .", "The decade in which the forensic evaluation was performed determined the variation in the criteria applied to violence risk as sessment for patients under compulsory hospitalization (McDermott et al., 2008) . The most prevalent factors in all the decades studied were: adherence and response to the proposed treatment, history of psychoactive substance use, and risk of violence (McDermott et al., 2008) . These factors were also found in a meta -analysis on the topic, together with: type of crime committed by the defendant and cons ent to the forensic examination, presence of psychiatric diagnosis, the expert’s experience and professional background (psychiatrist or psychologist), availability of alternative sources of information, prevailing jurisdiction, methodology, and conditions of the evaluation (use of PTs, simultaneous or sequential examiners) (Guarnera & Murrie, 2017) . The biases pertaining to the examiner’s professional background (field attendants, nurses, psychiatrists, and psychologists), tested with clinical vignettes in the context of CR, showed significant differences in the methodology adopted by each professional ca tegory and in the evaluation of the clinical elements in the capacity for self -determination (Högl und, Levander, Anckarsäter, & Radovic, 2009) . The type of forensic psychiatric or psychological evaluation performed (CST, CR, and violence risk assessment) was identified as an additional factor for inter -examiner disagreement (Guarnera & Murrie, 2017; Höglund et al., 2009; Kois, Wellbeloved -Stone, Chauhan, & Warren, 2017; Large, Nielssen, & Elliott, 200 9). In jurisdictions where CST and CR coexist, the simultaneous performance of both exams resulted in different", "conclusions from those when the two tests were performed at different moments (Höglund et al., 2009) . Inherent elements in each type of evaluation (CST and CR) can affect each examination’s methodology and objectives, generating biases for both conclusions (Höglund et al., 2009) . In CST examinations, experts acting for different sides (defense versus prosecution) showed low agreement (r=0.293) when compared to experts working for the same party (r=0.41) (Kois et al., 2017) . Moderate levels of agreement (r=0.51) were seen in CR examinations and in those with diagnosis of schizophre nia in the examinee (Kois et al., 2017) . There was higher agreement between examiners in homic ide cases (CST) and with the presence of diagnosis of schizophrenia (CR) (Kois et al., 2017) . A meta -analysis compared the agreement between the conclusions of expert reports on CST and CR on the same cases and obtained similar results. The study showed weak levels of inter -examiner agreement on the same forensic case (Table 1) (Large et al., 2009) .", "The mental disorder’s diagnostic group was identified as a source of bias in the forensic expert's conclusion (Golonka, 2016; Höglund et al., 2009) . Diagnoses of organic and psychotic mental disorders were more frequent in indi viduals considered incompetent in CST evaluations (Höglund et al., 2009) . Defendants who had committed their offense under the influence of psychoactive substances were more li kely to be considered competent in CST evaluations and to be convicted (Höglund et al., 2009) . The presence of a diagnosis of alcohol use disorder or alcohol intoxication at th e time of the offense contributed to the defendant’s being considered fit to stand to trial according to expert assessments performed by psychiatrists and psychologists in Poland (Golonka, 2016) . However, these variables in the presence of serious psychiatric comorbidity (psychotic disorder and mental retardation) did not interfere in the expert conclusion concerning CST CR reports produced in Switzerland in the 1970s and 1990s were analyzed to verify determinant factors for experts’ conclusions (Niveau & Sozonets, 2001) . Conclusions that reported a diagnosis of substance use disorder in forensic psychiatric asses sment were more prevalent than those reporting diagnoses of other mental disorders in both decades (Niveau & Sozonets, 2001) . The increase in conclusions using clinical and forensic psychometric tools was greater in the 1990s, alongside an increase in t he incidence of diagnoses of psychotic and mood disorders (depressive episode and recurrent depressive disorder) in expert reports (Niveau & Sozonets, 2001) . In the 1970s, diagnoses of personality disorders were more prevalent. Socioeconomic differences limited the", "scope of comparison of these results (Niveau & Sozonets, 2001) . Offenders with substance use disorders were more likely to be considered competent to stand trial, when compared to those with depressive and psychotic disorders (Niveau & Sozo nets, 2001) . The adoption of theoretical models applied to clinical psychiatry (such as decision -making) has been suggested as an alternative for forensic psychiatry in order to facilitate equivalence between legal and clinical terminologies (Guarnera & Murrie, 2017; Kalis & Meynen, 2014) . The adoption of clinical models has been suggested as a possible technical improvement in forensic psychiatric practice (Guarnera & Murrie, 4- Discussion We Our results show that disagreement is common between experts in the evaluation of the same criminal case and possibly involves multiple causal factors. Inter - examiner disagreement in criminal evaluations is actually the rule, which justifies a critical analysis of scientific and technical criteria adopted by forensic psychiatry. Grouping the biases according to their characteristics is useful for verifying the kind type of interference they generate and th e ways to avoid them (Table 1).", "The majority of literature reviews of our sample discussed aspects of current legislation and of theoretical models related t o legal capacities assessments in criminal matters . The case -control studies looked for agreement between experts in decisions for releasing individuals admitted in security hospitals for outpatients treatment , validation of psychometric tools for criminal responsibility and risk of violence assessments, quality of forensic reports submitted to criminal and agreement of forensic reports in a same case analyzed. There was only one meta -analysis in our sample, wh ich looked for agreement between experts in CST and CR assessments.", "Legal elements were chosen as the starting point to answer the questions that were raised, given the ultimate purpose of forensic psychiatry: to assist judges, jurors, and lawyers on p sychiatric matters (Rosner & Scott, 2017) . More than one article in our sample discussed the development of specific l egal texts to address the needs of FP as a way of avoiding biases and elucidating the case (Buchanan, 2015; Felthous, 2010; Joubert & van Staden, 2016; Lacroix et al., 2017; McSherry, 2004; Meynen, 2 012). Improvement of the legal definition of “competence” applied to FP, updating the legal terminologies with greater interface with this matter, and discussion between judges, lawyers, and forensic psychiatrists are possibilities for decreasing the in terference of legal biases in forensic psychiatric reports on criminal cases (Buchanan, 2015; Felthous, 2010; Joubert", "& van Staden, 2016; Lacroix et al., 2017; McSherry, 2004; Meynen, 2012) . Howev er, such modifications should primarily serve the legal sciences, given the existence of other factors (not pertaining to forensic psychiatry) involved in legal reasoning, and that should be independent from other areas of knowledge (Rosner & Scott, 2017) .", "Our review highlighted the existence of clinical presentations (with less evident psychiatric symptoms ) that are pertinent to forensic psychiatry and are not addressed by legal terminology (Joubert & van Staden, 2016; McSherry, 2004; O’Sullivan, 2018; Penney, 2012; Schleim, 2012) . In this sense, clinical presentation without classical and severe symptoms, like delusion and hallucinations, are not appreciated in legal texts and may generate confusion in the expert report (Joubert & van Staden, 2016; McSherry, 2004; O’Sullivan, 2018; Penney, 2012; Schleim, 2012) . The law requires the presence of a positive psychiatric diagnosis, the pathological element of the biopsychological criterion, as the prerequisite for considering the defendant not guilty by reason of insanity (Rosner & Scott, 2017) . However, certain clinical conditions lack an identifiable neurobiological component and/or do not fit the diagnosis of a psychiatric illness (Joubert & van Staden, 2016; O’Sullivan, 2018; Penney, 2012; Rosner & Scott, 2017; Schleim, The psychopath ologic specificities of automatisms (verbal tics, Tourette syndrome, and ballistic or chorea -like movements), parasomnias (somnambulism and sleep -wake cycle), and autism spectrum disorders are examples of clinical presentations not addressed by most crimin al legislations (McSherry, 2004) . In autism spectrum disorders, the impairments to inte rpersonal and environmental interaction are symptoms potentially capable of jeopardizing the performance of legal capacities, especially in more complex daily situations (Joubert & van Staden, 2016) . States of somnambulism or involuntary movements during sleep do not represent mental disorders and may not meet legal requirements (biolog ical element) for being considered mentally ill (McSherry, 2004; Rosner & Scott, 2017) . The difficulty in the classification and identification of these clinical conditions, determined by specific neurobiologic al and psychogenic elements, illustrates the complexity of expert evaluations in these cases.", "We contend that complementing the prevailing legal texts with clinical elements not contemplated by the law serves FP’s principal purpose. Specific legal texts prioritizing FP elements at the expense of legal aspects may raise difficulties for judges when drafting sentences and creating jurisprudence. The prioritization of forensic", "psychiatric concepts to the detriment of those originating in the legal sciences may compromise the development of legal reasoning, which has its own methodology. In addition, th e constant updating of legal texts may be counterproductive to the modus operandi of legal sciences, which require stability in the development of jurisprudence and rulings, essential for legal case flow.", "The production of legal reports is a key point in the interface between FP and the legal sciences, given the reports’ essential role in legal proceedings (evidence) in an area of knowledge outside the judge’s expertise. The low quality of these legal documents and high disagreement between documents on t he same case illustrate the difficulty of FP in defining its standard scientific criteria, and thus of establishing itself as a science (Fuger et al., 2014; Kacperska et al., 2016; Robinson & Acklin, 2010) .", "Our results point to t he lack of standardization, and of a common theoretical direction for FP in the development of precise expert reasoning, and the elaboration of legal reports (Fuger et al., 2014; Kacperska et al., 2016; Slovenko, 1999) . Expert’s countertransference issues and difficulty in accessing clinical and official records are additional elements that contributed to disagreements between expert reports on the sam e case.7 Another factor was the use of colloquial expressions or unnecessarily overstating mental disorders’ severity (Slovenko, 1999) .", "The pr ogressive distancing between the concepts of psychopathy applied to criminal justice and in contemporary psychiatry appeared in our results as a potential source of examiner bias on the same case submitted to forensic examination (Felthous, 2010; Murrie et al., 2008) . Recent advances in the diagnosis of personality disorders (alternative model of DSM 5), including antisocial personality disorder, represent important scientific strides that have still not been inc orporated into FP and legal sciences (Hopwood et al., 2012) .", "We found a similar situation with PCL -R in forens ic practice. One of the main contributions by this PT has been to provide an accurate definition of psychopathy, currently applied in FP, and to its psychometric evaluation (PCL -R) (Felthous, 2010; Murrie et al., 2008) . However, our results point to the limitation of PCL -R in forensic practice, given the interference from the examiner’s countertransference biases related to the type of offense committed or to the type of psychiatric diagnosis (Murrie et al., 2008) . Lack of training, limited practical experience with this PT, and sampling bias in other studies may explain the difference between the results with this PT in the validation study and in studies of forensic expert settings.", "The development of specific PTs (forensic assessment techniques) for verifying LCs was a significant achievement in forensic psychiatric evaluations of CST and CR (Advokat et al., 2012; Akinkunmi, 2002; Cai et al., 2014; Rogers et al., 1986; Rogers & Sewell, 1 999; Rosner & Scott, 2017) . The adoption of a psychometric indicator tends to decrease interferences from biases and to standardize the expert conclusion, attenuating the subjectivity of the evaluation. The principal difference between the PTs developed for the evaluation of LCs in our results involves their structuring, although both are norm - based tests (Advokat et al., 2012; Akinkunmi, 2002; Cai et al., 2014; Rogers et al., 1986; Rogers & Sewell, 1999; Rosner & Scott, 2017) . R-CRAS and RSCR are structured on psychometric invent ories (checklists), while MacArthur Criminal Adjudication and MacArthur Fitness to Plead are structured as clinical vignettes. These PTs appear to be methodologically more adequate for the evaluation of LCs than violence risk assessment tools, since they e xclusively consider the individual’s psychopathological constructs (Akinkunmi, 2002) . In our opinion, LCs are analyzed mainly through the evaluation of specific psychopathological constructs, while other variables (clinical characteristics and criminal dynamics) are complementary to the forensic psychiatric reasoning. The prioritization of the latter (rather than the former) may potentially bias the forens ic reasoning through idiosyncratic elements of the examiner, clinical prejudices, or biases related to the specific offense.", "The absence of a theoretical model providing a scrutinized basis for the psychopathological constructs of legal capacities assesse d by PTs such as R -CRAS and RSCR may be a methodological limitation. The inclusion of varied items, although related to clinical factors and the criminal dynamics and pertinent to the forensic examination, limit the examiner in scrutinizing the necessary p sychopathological constructs for examination of CST and CR (determined by law) and can generate countertransference bias (Cai et al., 2014; Rogers et al., 1986; Rogers & Sewell, 1999) . PTs structured in checklist format can be methodologically more adequate for screening severe cases that require a more focused expert evaluation, besides standardizing relevant elements of FP pertaining to the examination. MacCAT -CA and MacCAT -FP are PTs in vignette format whose methodology focuses on the individual’s psychopathological performance related to LCs (Hoge et al., 1997; Otto et al., 1998) .", "Another limitation to PTs structured as checklists is the possibility of direct interference from interviewer biases in their completion. In these cases, the score is more dependent on the interviewer’s evaluation than on the examinee’s psychopathological", "performance (Cai et al., 2014; Rogers et al., 1986; Rogers & Sewell, 1999) . Data on disagreement in the application of PCL -R support this statement (Murrie et al., 2008) . Additionally, the possibility of scoring a psychometric tool retrospectively, without a direct examinee’s evaluation, can be another factor of potential bias (as RSCR validation study). Meanwhile, PTs like the GCCT can display limited applicability to the extent that they were designed to meet the needs of specific legal texts in specific jurisdictions (Advokat et al., 2012) . However, similar jurisdictions in this matter can also benefit from these psychometric tools.", "In our opinion, ideally, specific PTs for the evaluation of lega l capacities (forensic assessment techniques) should focus on the single assessment of pertinent psychopathological constructs in order to preserve the nature of the object under investigation. The inclusion of variables extraneous to psychopathology, such as clinical elements or criminal dynamics, can bias the forensic evaluation. Importantly, the legal capacities appearing in legal texts correspond to psychopathological constructs, which are conceptualized by classical psychopathology (phenomenological me thod). That is, they are of a conceptual and immaterial (phenomenological) nature, and it is essential to distinguish them from characteristically factual or objective variables (clinical and criminal dynamics). These should complement the examination of L Cs, allowing an exact, impartial, and direct equivalence with the legal texts.", "The most frequent use of PTs in our sample was in reports on violence risk assessment, such as with PCL -R, HCR -20, VRAG, and AlaSATcom. These were used mainly to back the decision by experts to release patients from compulsory inpatient psychiatric treatment. The PTs developed for clinical psychiatry (BPRS, MEEM, and GAF) appeared in the final sample, but only in one articl e (Advokat et al., 2012) .35 The use of these PTs (clinica l assessment techniques) can add objective parameters to the expert evaluation, but given their clinical purpose, they may include elements that are not pertinent to FP and thus introduce unintended biases.", "A similar reasoning can be applied to the incorpo ration of theoretical models from clinical psychiatry for forensic purposes (Kalis & Meynen, 2014) . For example, decision - making models are useful in evaluating impulsive behaviors, but should not be confused with the inherent concepts of legal capacity (such as the capacity for self -determination), which have thei r own foundations in forensic psychopathology (Kalis & Meynen, 2014) . Rather, the incorporation of theoretical models developed specifically for FP should prevail in order to avoid clinical biases in the expert evaluations.", "The presence of preconceived theoretical elements involving experts’ countertransference wa s frequent in the articles comprising group 3 in our sample (Golonka, 2016; Guarnera & Murrie, 2017; Höglund et al., 2009; Kois et al., 2017 ; Large et al., 2009; McDermott, Gerbasi, Quanbeck, & Scott, 2005; Niveau & Sozonets, 2001) . The diagnosis of substance use disorders and states of acute intoxication (regardless of the presence of psychiatric diagnosis) while the offense was being comm itted were clinical conditions that favored the conclusion of criminal responsibility (Niveau & Sozonets, 2001) . Meanwhile, individuals that were assessed as having decreased criminal responsibility were more common in cases of diagnoses that are classi cally considered severe (schizophrenia and depression). Substance use disorders also favored the conclusion of CST in CR evaluations reported in our sample (Golonka, 2016; Niveau & Sozonets, 2001) . This variable may indicate that contexts related to psychoactive substances were present in most of the crimes studied (Golonka, 2016; Niveau & Sozonets, 2001) . Our results suggest that substa nce use disorders may be a potential source of bias in the expert’s conclusion, because they appear frequently in forensic settings and can negatively impact the examiner’s countertransference against the examinee, especially in the presence of a comorbid mental disorder without clear -cut symptoms.", "Factors related to the historical moment of the expert evaluation and new scientific knowledge in psychiatry (such as the development of PTs and diagnostic classification manuals) modified and improved forensic psychiatric technique (Golonka, 2016) . Modifications of the diagnostic models for personality disorders (alternative model of DSM 5) are recent and will require further studies to verify their effect on forensic psychiatry (Hopwood et al., 2012) .", "Studies with high agreement between examiners were infrequent and displayed limitations in their methods and practical execution (i.e., simultaneous intervie w) (Murrie et al., 2008) . Those with medium to low agreement had independent interviewers, used multiple and non -standardized data sources, and took place in diverse evaluation settings. The high number of expert evaluations of insa nity defense in the same case contributed to the increase in disagreement between examiners (Kacperska e t al., 2016) . The presence of experts with different professional backgrounds contributed to the disagreement between examiners on the same case (Fuger et al., 2014; Murrie et al., 2008) . Investigations that performed independent sequential evaluations with more than one expert showed higher rates of disagreement, when compared to those performing", "simultaneous evaluations (Fuger et al., 2014; Kacperska et al., 2016; Murrie et al., 2008) . The multiplicity of factors related to the investigation’s setting limited the comparison of results in our sample. Importantly, reports performed by more than one examiner with the same professional background may represent a relevant criterion for the scientific standards of psychiatric examinations in criminal cases, since both can (simultaneously and mutually) help decrease biases and elements of countertransference.", "The final sa mple in our review only included articles pertaining to criminal offenses. The generalization of our results to other areas of FP, such as civil and workplace assessments , in not possible, given the difference between the factors addressed in these setting s and in criminal law. The different keywords used in studies on this topic may have limited the scope of our results, although we searched a total of 11 search terms (method item). The exclusion of articles in languages other than English may also have li mited the final sample.", "5. Conclusion", "The variety of sources of biases in forensic psychiatric reports reveals the theme’s complexity and the difficulty in decreasing their interference. Our results provide guidance for this undertaking. The key points a re detailed knowledge of inherent psychopathological concepts for legal capacities, standardization of the examination, the use of psychometric indicators developed specifically for FP (particularly those that exclusively assess legal capacities), and conc ise drafting of the expert report. Other key points are preferential use of well -established scientific terms, avoidance of jargon and buzzwords in the expert report, and simultaneous evaluations by professionals with the same background and with experienc e in the area. All of these in combination may help decrease the disagreement between examiners on the same case, making it possible to assist judges in producing adequate rulings and sentences, through expert reports that portray the presence or absence o f clear psychopathy and its role in crimes committed by individuals with or without mental disorders.", "REFERENCES", "Advokat, C.

Abstract Criminal responsibility assessment is undertaken by psychologists or psychiatrists to assess offenders’ legal capacities, which vary among countries or regional legislations. There are two psychometric tools (i.e., checklists) validated for criminal responsibility assessment: the Roger Criminal Responsibility Scale, and the rating scale of criminal responsibility for mentally disordered offenders. Despite the existence of psychometric tools structured in clinical vignettes for evaluating legal capacities, none serve the purpose of assessing criminal responsibility. This stud y aims to validate a novel psychometric tool structured in vignettes for the assessment of criminal responsibility called the “Criminal Responsibility Scale.” We applied the tool to 88 defendants referred for criminal responsibility assessment in a forensi c medical institute in the city of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, from December 2017 to December 2018. The validity of the Criminal Responsibility Scale and subscales were evaluated using confirmatory factor analysis. The two -factor solution proved satisfactory a nd met the needs for practical application of the tool (Kaiser –Meyer –Oklin= 0.82; p< .001). Moreover, the inter -rater reliability was evaluated by comparing the tool’s final score with that of the expert’s conclusion in each case and was found to be satisf actory (k= .667 -1.0), with a resulting cutoff point of 30.50 (±2) and a Youden index of 0.509. Hence, the Criminal Responsibility Scale is an effective psychometric", "tool for assessments of criminal responsibility that may encourage future research in asses sments of legal capacity with clinical vignette -based psychometric instruments.", "1 Introduction", "Criminal responsibility (CR) is the degree of legal liability attributed to a defendant accused of committing an illegal act (1,2) . Ruled out or diminished CR is possible in very specific situations when the defendant is considered not guilty due to an insanity plea (3,4) . In this case, it is claimed that the defendant’s mental status at the time of the offense was impaired (1,2) .", "CR is a retrospective forensic psychiatric assessment that is based on the individual offender’s mental status, interviews with collaterals, analysis of court pro ceedings, and medical briefs (1,2) . Offenders’ CR is determined by their legal capacities (LCs), which correspon d to specific psychopathological constructs (1-4). An offender’s “legal capacity” refers to his/her ability to act within the framework of the legal system, and this ability is based on whether the offender suffers from psychopathologies as determined by a psychia trist or psychiatrist. (1). The relationship between LCs and clinical symptoms are discussed in the literature, and address the relevant challenges of the forensic technique (4-7). Article 26 of the Brazilian Penal Code (8) establishes the criteria for determining whether an offender can be considered with ruled out or diminished responsibility, as in the following: “It is exempt from punishment the agent who, on account of mental illness or incomplete or delayed mental development, was at the time of the action or omission completely incapable of understanding the illicit nature of the fact or of self -determine accordin g to this understanding. Single paragraph. The sentence may be reduced by one - to two -thirds, if the agent, in virtue of mental disorder or incomplete or delayed mental development, was not completely capable of understanding the illicit nature of the fact or of self -determine according to this understanding.” Article 26 is based upon the biopsychological criterion, which is applied by the forensic psychiatrist to evaluate the examinee for the presence of psychiatric disorder and clinical impairments at the time of the offense (2). The biopsychological criterion is composed of four components: i) pathological element (i.e., mental illness or disorder), ii) causality between the pathologic al element and the offense, iii) cognitive and volitional elements, and iv) the presence of chronological nexus. All four elements must be considered in CR assessments.", "The pathological elements have strong compatibility with the nosology for mental disord ers present in the International Classification of Mental Disorders (ICD -10) (9). The p athological elements are present in four categories of the ICD -10, namely a) mental illness (comprising serious psychiatric disorders such as psychotic syndromes, dementia, delirium , and psychosis induced by psychoactive substances that may fully prejudice cognitive or volitional abilities at the time of the offense), b) mental disorder (comprising psychiatric disorders which partially affect cognitive and volitional elements of imputability, such as personality disorders, paraphilias, mood disorders withou t psychotic symptoms, and mild intellectual disability), c) incomplete or delayed mental development (comprising moderate to severe intellectual disability or developmental disorder diagnosis), and d) addiction (comprising severe substance use disorders) (2).", "The causality component of the biopsychological criterion requires a determination of whether the offense is necessarily an expression of a mental disorder (2). The cognitive and volitional elements are referred to as “capacity for understanding” (CU) and “capacity for self -determination” (CD), respectively (2). CU is defined as the capability to fully acknowledge an act's illicit nature, and CD is the aptitude toward self-determination according to this understanding (2).", "In Brazil, forensic psychiatrists have three possible conclusions in a defendant’s CR assessment (2). The defendant can be considered criminally res ponsible (i.e., entirely capable of understanding and self-determining according to the act's illicit nature), partially responsible (i.e., partially incapable of understanding and/or self -determining according to the act's illicit nature), and not crimina lly responsible (i.e., considered entirely incapable of understanding and/or self -determination according to the act's illicit nature) (2). Other countries’ legislations also include CU and CD in the assessment of CR, such as the jurisdictions covered by the American Law Institute (ALI) (1,10) . In other jurisdictions, such as those covered by the M'Naghten Rule, only CU i s considered accordingly (1,7) . Notably, the theoretical models defining the psychopathological constructs of CU and CD have been sufficiently developed (1-4,11,12) . The main study on this topic listed 64 elements that describe in detail the psychopathological constructs of CU and CD that are included in article 26 of the Brazilian Penal Code (13). Despite being sufficiently developed, the traditional theoretical models of forensic psychiatry that are applied to CR assessment draw on original legal terminologies that may be outdated. (1,2,10,13) . Currently, the pertinence of these theoretical models, in tandem with the need for changes in the wording of legal texts in light of contemporary psychiatric and psychological knowledge, is", "being deliberated (1,5,13,14) . In Canada, the rece nt discussions to amend the wording of the legislation regarding CR highlight these controversies (15).", "Furthermore, theoretical models used in clinical psychiatry have been considered as alternatives to the traditional theoretical models for CR to address biases (6-9,16,17). The low quality of forensic psychiatric reports submitted to the criminal courts and the high rate of inter -examiner disagreement reveal the necessity of improving the CR assessment techniques (18-20). The lack of objective parameters f or verifying CU and CD are additional issues that need to be considered (19,20) . The development of specific psy chometric tools for examining CR has yielded scientific progress in contemporary forensic psychiatry (21,22) . The Roger Criminal Responsibility Assessment Scale (R - CRAS ) and the rating scale of criminal responsibility for mentally disordered offenders (RSCRs) are Psychometric tools developed to complement CR assessments (23-25). Both are structured as norm - based inventories with relevant items for CR forensic psychiatric assessment. The R -CRAS consists of 30 items that are typi cally rated on a six -point scale, and their relevance to psycho -legal issues concerning the insanity plea are represented through 6 cardinal groups: behavioral control, cognitive control, causal relationship, major mental disorder, malingering, and organic ity (24,25) . Meanwhile, the RSCRs comprises 18 items regarding criminal motivation: aura before the offense; inducement to the crime; time, place, and object/tool used in the offense; emotion during the offense; shirking responsi bility for the offense; concealment of facts during the interview; camouflage; comprehension of the nature of the offense; estimating the consequences; functional impairment; learning or work impairment; impairment of insight; impairment of reality; and im pairment of self -control (25). Psychometric tools developed specifi cally to assess LCs represent the holistic progression of forensic practice (21-24,26 -28). Better characterized Psychometric tools are structured in vignettes, such as the MacArthur Competence Assessment Tool for Consent to Research (MacCAT -CR), MacArthur Competence Assessment Tool for Treatment (MacCAT -T), MacArthu r Criminal Adjudication (MacCAT -CA), and MacArthur Competence Assessment Tool -Fitness to Plead (MacCAT -FP) (26- 31). The last tool is commonly used by criminal forensic psychiatrists in Anglo -Saxon countries in suppo rt of the experts evaluating a defendant's competency to stand trial (26-30). Clinical vignettes are frequently used in research on the legal theory of competence (26-30) and seem more suitable for LC assessments than psychometric tools that utilize checklists and inventories (i.e., R -CRAS and RSCRs)", "Clinical vignettes may be frequently used for research on LCs, but their use remains unexplored for CR assessment. There are no psychometric tools to date structured in vignettes to assess CR. Hence, the main objective of this study was to develop and validate a personal interview structured in vignettes to complement the CR assessment, called the “Criminal Responsibility Scale” (CRS).", "2 Material and Methods", "The CRS is based on the MacArthur -CA clinical vignette structure (26,28 -30) and the main psychopathologi cal theoretical model concerning the assessment of CR in Brazil (13). The main hypothesis tested in our study is that the assessment of the psychopatholo gical constructs of CU and CD can be performed with a structured interview based on clinical vignettes, with questions and answers unrelated to the respective offender or criminal setting. We now describe the elaboration stages of the CRS.", "2.1 Theoretical mode l for CU and CD", "A meticulous review of the forensic psychopathology literature on CU and CD resulted in the identification of 64 related psychopathological constructs (2,13) . According to the literature, LCs can only be assessed through a direct assessment of the examinee (2,13) . Moreover, criminal dynamics, collateral reports, depositions, health treatments, and forensic psychiatric documents provide complementary data for forensic evaluation but they cannot be used to directly assess LCs (2,13) . CU refers to psychologi cal cognitive elements regarding the perception, grasp, and understanding of reality and natural phenomena (2,13) . In Latin, to understand means to grasp with the mind, to perceive. It also includes a sense of extension, intention, pretension, selection, and a combination of cognitive elements originating from reality (2,13) . Ultimately, to comprehend something means to possess it or grasp it. Classical psychological processes relat ed to comprehending something, such as memory, intelligence, and thinking, are commonly investigated during psychiatric assessments (2,13) . Conversely, CD refers to self -determination, which entails a sense of delineating, demarcating, regulating, and fixing one’s own life. In other words, it involves the notion of a termination, end, or limit to one’s involvement in an act (2,13) . Classical psychological processes related to self - determination, such as will, mood, and affect, are commonly investigated during psychiatric assessments. Furthermore, in forensic psychopathology and judicial proceedings, consideration of an individual’s actions (or omissions) includes an assessment of the offender’s cognitive elements, or CU,", "followed by an assessment of their self -determination, or CD. (2,13) . However, there are legal exceptions to this rule, i.e., factors that attenuate or rule out the illegality of the acts or omissions, such as claims of passion or self -defense (2). Such cases purportedly involve an instinctive, reactive, or impulsive reaction by the offender, regardless of the cognitive elements present before the act or omission (2).", "2.2 Structuring of the CRS: Clinical vignettes", "Psychometric tools structured in clinical vignettes are methodologically appropriate for the assessment of LCs (21,22) . The elicitation of histories encompassing themes not correlated to the offender and questions focused on specific psychopathological constructs allow a direct assessment of the examinee’s psychopathology (28–31)..", "Clinical vignettes were prepared for this study that focused on specific psychopathological constructs and the criteria for rating the responses. The MacCAT -CA was used as the main source of ideas for the development of CRS clinical vignettes and the score criteria (26 -29). Before using the CRS for the pilot group and final sample, the content for the vignettes was discussed by three forensic psychiatri sts who are members of the research team and have considerable experience in CR assessments. The first version of the vignettes included a more detailed scene narrative. During the revision process, we focused on simplifying the text until the description achieved a neutral context, with the ambiance of a common entertainment situation (e.g., a card game). The final clinical vignette portrays the brief history of an offense, as in the following text.", "“I’m going to read a short history for you. Then I’m goin g to ask your opinion on some points.” “Two people, John and Paul, are playing cards in a room. They are sitting facing each other. Suddenly they begin to argue, and John pushes Paul. Paul falls off the chair, hits his head on the floor, and dies.” The ps ychopathological constructs assessed by the CRS were selected from the previously discussed study on forensic psychopathology in Brazil (13). Among the 64 elements (i.e., psychopathological constructs), a majority were defined as CU and only a few were defined as CD (13), and the distribution of CRS items for the CU and CD subscales were distributed with the same relative proportions.", "The CRS included two subscales, titled understanding and self -determination. The purpose of the two subscales was to affirm the statistical validity of the original theoretical model for CU and CD, approved by the Brazilian Penal Code (i.e., biopsychologic al criteria), and to preserve their original legal and psychopathological meaning in this study (2,13) .", "2.3 Composition of the CRS and scoring criteria", "The psychopathological elements chosen for inclusion in the CRS to represent the CU and CD constructs were debated extensively among the researchers. A few elements were grouped in a single item, gi ven their conceptual similarity. We opted to follow the ordering of the psychopathological elements in the original theoretical model (13).", "Based on the vignettes, we drafted at least one question per element. Each question was intended to test a psychopathological construct based on the offender’s response, which was recorded verbatim by the examiner and scored based on the scoring criteria referencing s pecific psychopathological elements (Appendix A).", "Additional information or excerpts were added to the vignettes during the interview. The purpose of the excerpts was to modify the individual’s initial impression of the vignette by introducing alterations in the psychopathological elements of the respective items. For example, two excerpts were included for item VIII, which consists of three questions. The first two questions (“a” and “b”) pertain to the first excerpt and measure the individual’s ability to assimilate or forego values and the coherence of the component elements in the volitional act . The last question (“c”) pertains to the second vignette and assesses the act’s legitimacy (Appendix A). A total of four additional excerpts were added to the The vignettes’ narrative content portrays situations that are easily identified in daily contexts of betting games, disputes, and interpersonal crises, and have a criminal act as the outcome. The researchers discussed various options for the vignettes and ultimately chose to develop more simplified versions representing nominal identification of the active and passive agents of assault to facilitate the examinee’s comprehension. Elements of a social, political, regional, religious, economic, or sexual nature were not included in the vignettes or the questions to avoid elements that were not pertinent to the LCs and that could potentially induce assessment bias.", "2.4 Final version of the CRS", "The final version of the CRS is summarized in Table 1. Each ite m explores a specific psychopathological construct, sometimes with more than one question. For didactic reasons, each question should be understood as a subitem of the CRS. The items’ order, questions’ wording, and subitem scores’ criteria were discussed a nd approved by the research team during the elaboration and testing of the CRS until the tool was finalized.", "The final version of the CRS contains 12 items with 19 questions, and the total score varies from 0 to 38. The CU subscale includes 9 items, with a total of 15 questions and a score range of 0 to 30. The CD subscale includes 3 items, with a total of 4 questions (i.e., with a score range of 0 to 8). The score assigned by the interviewer to each question was “0” (i.e., no acknowledgment of the cited", "psychopathological elements, or answered with pathological elements), “1” (i.e., partial acknowledgment of at least one of the cited psychopathological elements), or “2” (i.e., assertive acknowledgment of at least one of the cited psychopathological elemen ts).", "The final version of the CRS was pilot tested in two different population samples (total n= 20). The first group (n=10) consisted of inpatients diagnosed with psychiatric disorders at a clinical psychiatric hospital in Rio de Janeiro city. The second group (n=10) involved controls, i.e., individuals who were not diagnosed with any psychiatric disorder after undergoing a forensic assessment of CR at the same site where this study was being conducted. Only the individuals from the second group (n=10) we re included in the final study sample since they met the inclusion criteria.", "2.5 Sample", "The final sample consisted of 88 participants, who were selected from the individuals referred for a forensic assessment of CR at the Heitor Carrilho Forensic Psychiatry In stitute, the only forensic psychiatric institute in the city of Rio de Janeiro. This institution is responsible for all CR exams in Rio de Janeiro State. Participants were selected from among the individuals scheduled for CR assessment from December 2017 t o December 2018.", "The inclusion criteria were as follows: age 18 years or older, the existence of formal criminal charges brought against the individual by the Public Prosecutor’s Office, a court order for forensic assessment of CR, and informed consent fo r participation. The sample excluded individuals who were unable to communicate verbally, not fluent in Portuguese, represented by insufficient sociodemographic data, or unable to sign informed consent.", "2.6 Application of the CRS and comparison with forensic e xpert’s conclusion Validation of the CRS included a comparison of its final score with the forensic expert’s conclusion, which was considered the gold standard for CR assessment. Our study used three researchers with experience in forensic psychiatric a ssessment of CR who worked in alternating pairs to select and assess the participants, and oversee the completion of the CRS and sociodemographic questionnaire. First, participants were selected and assessed, and then they underwent the forensic assessment of CR. The subitem scores of the CRS were rated individually by each pair of researchers. Subitems with divergent scores were discussed by the research pairs on a case -by-case basis to determine the best", "score in each situation. Subsequently, divergences were examined to verify the agreement between researchers in the application of the CRS.", "Finally, the expert’s conclusion was compared to the total CRS score (Fig. 1). The forensic assessments of CR at Heitor Carrilho Forensic Psychiatry Institute were c onducted by a single expert, and there was no communication between the researchers and the expert. Inconclusive cases (n=4) according to the experts were excluded from the final sample, which only included cases accompanied by the conclusion of an asserti ve forensic expert.", "3 Results", "The participants were defendants, either in custody, or awaiting trial, and were referred for the assessment of CR. A convenience sample was selected from a total of 92 participants, and 4 were excluded due to insufficient data. The final sample consisted of 88 participants, all of whom freely signed the informed consent form to participate in this study. As shown in Table 2, we analyzed the frequency of psychiatric dia gnostic groups (ICD -10), the respective mean values on the CRS, the legal terms applied to participants, and the respective mean", "values on the CRS. Concerning sociodemographic characteristics, the majority of the sample consisted of males (84.1%), with a m ean age of 37.07 years (± 12.65) at the time of the study and a mean age of 34.74 years (± 12.36) at the time of the offense. As for their legal characteristics, 69.8% were awaiting trial and 54.1% had a prior criminal record, with larceny as the most freq uent crime. Most of the participants were single (66.3%), lived with their nuclear family and did not have children (53.5%), and were not receiving social security benefits (79.1%). Half (50%) had formal jobs, and the self - reported skin color was black (40 .7%), white (34.7%), brown (22%), and yellow (2.3%) according to the Brazilian National Institute of Geography and Statistic (IBGE) classification. Many had not received professional training (68%), and 30.9% had a family income of one monthly minimum wage (approximately 250 USD/month).", "3.1 Completion of the total CRS", "The CRS was completed by recording the participant’s responses verbatim, which were always individualized for each subitem, immediately after each question was asked by the interviewer. The interviewer was permitted to repeat the question with an explanation in case the partic ipant has any doubt about the content. The interviewer could use synonyms, but without including personal impressions or inferences when explaining or rewording the question. Each question (subitem) could be repeated up to three consecutive times. Also, th e annotated answers were not reworded after being recorded by the interviewer and the score was inspired by the MacCAT -CA (27-30). There are qualitative specificities in the scoring criteria adopted for each subitem (Appendix A). Similarly, positive reinforcement was given to the participant after answering each item to boost their performance on the CRS. The interviewer could use a bracketed alternative version for each subitem. For example, when reading item I(B) “Do you think John’s behavior (the person who pushed Paul) is illegal (or criminal)?” the interviewer can reword the question using the options provided in the brackets. In item I(B), the option is [ Do you think what John (the person who pushed Paul) did is illegal (criminal)? ]. For item IV(A), “ Do you think John is responsible for Paul's death (the pushed person)? Why? ” the option is [ Do you think John’s push caused Paul's death? Why?].", "Answers that provided little or no clarity deserve special attention when completing the CRS. Some of these answers represented active symptoms, in which case they received a score of “0.” Symptomatic participants recurrently answered question s with the same phrasal structure and/or content, sometimes with little language variations. These repeated answer patterns were also verified in participants with thinking or intellectual disabilities. However, such situations also occurred when the indiv idual showed little willingness or interest in providing objective responses. In such cases, patterns of responses were obtained that demonstrated the individual’s comprehension of the question, despite the lack of objectivity. The speech patterns we ident ified were: 1) reflexive (or rhetorical), 2) personal, and 3) ideological.", "First, the reflexive (or rhetorical) pattern was seen in responses that addressed the questions’ contents tangentially but not objectively. In this pattern, the individual intentio nally reversed the burden of the response onto the interviewer through the employment of rhetoric. For example, one answer to item IV(A) illustrates this pattern: “But what does being guilty denote in this story? Guilt is relative and subjective. There’s s omething more to explain John’s reaction.” The degree of complexity in this", "response pattern demonstrates satisfactory comprehension of the question’s content, does not suggest pathological alterations, and received a score of “2.” Second, the personal pattern occurred when the individuals used themselves as part of the answer. These cases displayed a victimized attitude, with a predisposition to empathize with or show solidarity toward the clinical vignette’s content or characters. For example, one ind ividual responded as follows to item IV(A): “This story sounds like mine. Maybe John is being framed. The story doesn’t say whether he was provoked first. It may have been a reaction by John.” Or, “Nobody would push the chair to kill. You’d have to see whe ther he really intended to kill his friend. It could have been an accident, as in my case.” In such cases, the score assigned to the item was “2,” since it demonstrated the capacity to comprehend the question’s content.", "Third, the ideological pattern tend ed to use responses that rival or downplay the content of the vignettes and questions in the CRS. For example, one individual answered I(B) as follows: “It’s only illegal in Brazil if you can’t afford a lawyer. Jail is only for poor blacks.” Further, in th e answer to item IV(A): “The guilty party is always the little guy. We’re never going to know what really happened because the story [vignette] is incomplete. Sometimes there are two victims of society.” Thus, the individual tends to use such questions to justify or downplay illegal acts, in the sense of seeking the interviewer’s solidarity with the vignette’s criminal act, and consequently with their case. In such cases, the score All of these response patterns highlight the complexity of the semantic elements addressed and the ordering of the themes expressed in the responses. Such elements preserve the individual’s cognition in deciphering the question’s meaning.", "3.2 Inter -rater reliability", "When a psychometric test is applied by two or more exam iners, it is imperative to verify whether consensus has been achieved with experts’ assessments, i.e., whether they interpret and similarly assess the test. One of the most common statistics used in this analysis is Cohen’s kappa reliability index. Kappa v alues from 0.60 to 0.79 reflect moderate levels of agreement, 0.80 to 0.90 indicate a strong level of agreement, and over 0.90 denotes a nearly perfect level agreement. Indices greater than 0.60 are considered satisfactory.", "The researchers signified sat isfactory inter-rater agreement, with a Cohen’s kappa index ranging from 0.677 to 1.0 ( Table 1). The mean kappa value was 0.85. We used three interviewers who took turns in pairs to complete the CRS and to avoid biases, which was done jointly by both membe rs of the pair.", "3.3 Exploratory factor analysis", "Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) is a practice that summarizes the similarities between variables in a dataset, thereby reducing the dimensions of the data when there are many variables. Some assumptions regar ding the dataset need to be stated to use this technique: the relationship between the variables must be linear; the samples must be adequate, that is, with sufficient sample size, a condition verified by the Kaiser -Meyer -Olkin (KMO) test; and the data mus t be adequate to reduce the dimensions, a condition verified with Barlett’s test of sphericity.", "The CRS displayed adequate internal consistency, with a KMO value of 0.82, higher than the required minimum of 0.6, proving the sample’s adequacy. Barlett’s tes t obtained satisfactory significance (p< 0.001), rejecting the null hypothesis that the correlation matrix is an identity matrix meant to utilize the data. Moreover, the KMO and Barlett’s test results obtained with the independent analysis of the subitems were identical to those mentioned above.", "Similarly, the CRS consists of items and subitems that allow the implementation of two types of EFA. Hence, we first analyzed models that considered the subdivisions (i.e., subitem IA, IB, IIA, etc.) of the data’s s tructure. Then we analyzed models that only considered the entire items (i.e., item I, item II, etc.). The reason for this approach is that selecting entire items ensures greater adequacy in terms of the original theoretical model and between the variables and the factors in the analysis of the results. The two -factor solution denoted satisfactory values for the adequacy test. The reliability analysis (i.e., Cronbach’s alpha) obtained values of 0.72 for factor 1 and 0.72 for factor 2, compared to a required minimum of 0.6. The total variance in the results explained by the model was equal to 36%. The internal reliability values for factors 1 and 2 were acceptable. The CRS showed a Cronbach’s alpha of 0.86, and the exclusion of any item from factors 1 and 2 d id not improve the performance of this index (Table", "The exploratory factor model, without a subdivision of the items, resulted in a satisfactory fit of the original model (Fig. 2). A statistically satisfactory correlation was determined between F1 (CD) and F2 (CU) (r=0.59). Among the three items from the or iginal model for CD, two comprised factor 1, namely items X (i.e., perception of social and legal disapproval) and XI (i.e., intent and animus ), and both presented significant indices (0.73 and 0.69, respectively). The other components of factor 1, items I (i.e., notion of legal good) and IX (i.e., notion of censure, consequences of the act) were not originally part of the CD, but they also obtained satisfactory indices (0.55 and 0.65, respectively) (Fig.", "For factor 2 (CU), three items presented sati sfactory correlation indices, namely items II (0.57), III (0.77), and IV (0.76). All of tese were part of the original model for CU. A correlation was seen between items X (factor 1) and IV (factor 2) (r= 0.51). The inclusion of this correlation between it ems X (factor 1) and IV (factor 2) was essential for developing the model’s validation. Despite the weak correlation, the inclusion of this association augmented the final model (Fig. 2).", "3.4 CRS, diagnostic groups, and legal terminology", "We analyzed correlati ons between the total CRS and psychiatric diagnostic groups and the legal terminology in the Brazilian Penal Code (Table 4). There were differences in the mean CRS scores between the groups, with the lowest CRS scores reported for the psychotic disorders g roup (i.e., schizophrenia -like and bipolar mood disorder) and the group with mental illness. The mean score for the group “without mental illness” was lower than for the group with “substance use disorders” (table 4). This finding may be explained by the p resence of conscious simulation (i.e., malingering) in the first group of individuals (Table 4). In the group “without mental disorder related to legal terminology,” the effect of false -negative participants (i.e., individuals with a diagnosis of malingeri ng or conscious simulation) is less evident in the total CRS score (Table 4).", "We attempted to test the differences in correlations between the diagnostic groups (ICD -10), legal terminology, and total CRS score. Using the Kruskal -Wallis non -parametric te st, a statistically significant difference was found between the groups by psychiatric diagnosis (ICD -10) (p< 0.012) and legal terminology (p< 0.002).", "We found significant differences in the total CRS score among the following psychiatric diagnostic group s: intellectual disability and without mental illness (p≤ 0.039), intellectual disability and personality disorder (p≤ 0.009), intellectual disability and substance use disorder (p≤ 0.001), and substance disorder and schizophrenia -like disorders and a bipo lar mood disorder (p≤ 0.032). We also found the following differences in the total CRS score by legal terminology: delayed mental development and mental health disturbance (p≤ 0.011), delayed mental development and without a corresponding legal term (p≤ 0.003), mental illness and mental health disturbance (p≤ 0.019), and mental illness and without a corresponding legal term (p≤ 0.005).", "3.5 ROC curve and cutoff point", "ROC curve is used to define a test’s cutoff point, such as in a psychometric test. We opted to use the AUC and the statistics for the maximization of sensitivity and specificity (Youden index) to define the ideal cutoff point. Values greater than 0.5 in the Youden index were considered satisfactory for a psychometric test like the CRS.", "The total CR S score was compared to the forensic expert’s conclusion of criminally responsible, partially responsible, or not criminally responsible. This analysis revealed satisfactory indices for distinguishing between criminally responsible and not responsible indi viduals, with a cutoff point of 30.50 (±2) (Youden= 0.509). The ROC curve for the other groups (i.e., criminally responsible and partially responsible; not criminally responsible and partially responsible) di d not show satisfactory indices.", "4 Discussion", "We describe the statistical validation of the CRS, the first psychometric test structured in vignettes, to complement the assessment of CR. The psychometric properties of the CRS showed satisfactory statistical validity, despite the need for partial adapta tion of the original theoretical model. The psychopathological constructs of CU and CD jointly contributed to the original model’s validation. A satisfactory correlation between item IV (i.e., the notion of culpability, competence to stand trial, and respo nsibility) and item X (i.e., perception of legal and social disapproval) reinforces the validity of the alternative hypothesis (Fig. 2). This result suggests a correlation between these two psychopathological processes and also how ideological notions of c ulpability and responsibility (item IV) bridge the recognition of practical notions of legal goods and social benefits (item X). In other words, these two items show, in a direct way, how the interchange of psychopathological performances operate between C U and CD.", "The Cronbach’s alpha for the CRS was satisfactory and demonstrated consistency between the items, but still lower than the Cronbach’s alpha for the validation of the RSCR s (0.93) and higher than for the R-CRAS (0.63) (24,25) . Differences in the structural design of the Psychometric tools and the type of score items adopted explain the difference between the coefficients. The lack of strictly psychopathological variables precluded a detailed comparison of the R -CRAS, RSCR s, and CRS", "The ROC curve analysis showed satisfactory indices for distinguishing between the criminally responsible versus not responsible groups, w ith a cutoff point of 30.50 (±2). The cutoff may have been influenced by the time between the offense and the CR assessment, exemplified by a mean of two years in our sample. This evidence may have modified the psychopathological characteristics of the participants, especially those that presented clinical improvement in the period. A surprising result was the lack of validity of the CRS for the identification of the group with partial responsibility compared to the criminally responsible and not criminally responsible groups. This fact may suggest the technical vulnerability of the partially responsible category in CR assessment, reducing the forensic expert’s ability to be assertive about the assessment of CU and CD at the time of the offense (2,13) . Also, R -CRAS and RSCR s do not directly assess psychopathological constructs, as demanded by law for the assessment of LCs (24,25) . Meanwhile, CRS scrutinizes the inherent psychopathological constructs in CU and CD according to the examinees’ performance. Hence, the adoption of objective parameters for scoring answers in CRS enabled the statistical validation of these psychopathologica l constructs, according to the traditional theoretical model of CR (2,13) . This model pres ents phenomenological (i.e., subjective) characteristics identical to those adopted by classical psychopathology (13,32-35).", "The inter -examiner agreement of the CRS resulted in a relatively high average value (table 1) . Nevertheless, the characteristics of scientificity inherent in the psychopathological constructs of LCs can be observed in the structure of the CRS and the order of its items and subitems. Moreover, the structure of the clinical vignettes requires rigorous ordering of the psychopathological constructs assessed by the interviewer (21,22). Other validated psychometric tests in the vignette format for the assessm ent of LCs reinforce these arguments (27-31).", "The nature of the retrospective assessment of CR can introduce differences in the scoring of psychometric tests structured in vignettes, compared to the competence to st and trial via cross -sectional assessment (27-31). This characteristic was seen in the scores obtained with the CRS in each diagnostic group according to the ICD -10 (Table 4). Psychiatric diagnoses with well -defined psychopathological alterations (i.e., schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and intellectual disability) presented lower CRS scores compared to the other diagnoses (i.e., mood disorder and anxiety disorders related to substance use, personality disorders, a nd without mental illness) (Table 4). The period between the offense and the forensic assessment (i.e., 2 years on average) may have contributed to this result and the cutoff point", "obtained in the CRS validation may indicate a potential compromise in the f orensic assessment when there are long intervals between the offense and the assessment.", "Individuals with a diagnosis of malingering or conscious simulation (Z76.5 , by the ICD -10) had the lowest scores on the CRS among the diagnostic groups. This result co ntributed to the lower score on the CRS in the group without mental illness, compared to the total mean CRS score (table1) . These individuals (n=8) had the lowest mean CRS scores (i.e., less than 10) among all the diagnoses studied. This finding is consist ent with the performance of malingerers in clinical and forensic psychometric The comparison of the group with diagnoses according to the ICD -10 and the group with legal terms showed the best performance for the CRS in the latter group. In light of contemporary psychiatry, our study does not support arguments that defend updating psychopathological constructs and current terminologies for diagnostic clas sification in legal studies (3,14,15). The introduction of parameters specifically developed for clinical practice (i.e., the decision -making process) to assess LCs can introduce bias in experts’ conclusions, rather than maintaining the tec hnical assumptions of impartiality as preconized (1). Hence, it is crucial to explore concepts of LC in light of their original theoretical models and with Psychometric tools specifically developed for this purpose (1,21,22) . The CRS contributed to the forensic expert’s distinction between criminally responsible versus not responsible individuals despite the time that transpired between the offense and the CR assessment. Special attention should be paid to the group with partial CR in some jurisdictions, as in the Brazil ian Penal Code, which did not show statistical reaffirmation in our study (2). Therefore, the forensic expert’s conclusion of partial responsibility would appear to be more prone to potential biases when compared to the criminally responsible and not responsible groups. The RSCR s presented satisfactory indices in the identification of criminally responsible, partially criminally responsible, and not criminally responsible individuals, but its structure is not based exclusively on psychopathological elements, as in the forensic assessments of CR (25). Therefore, the identification of partial responsibility in forensic assessments still lacks objective psychopathological criteria.", "Our results help answer current questions in forensic psychiatry. The purp ose of forensic psychiatry is to support judges and lawyers in developing the necessary legal reasoning for rulings on offenses (1,2) . It is essential to focus on the specificities of concepts used in this area of knowledge, originally from the human sciences, and technically preserve their limits and practical objectives (13,32-35). To", "overstep such limits may compromise a judge’s performance and the technical quality of forensic evidence used by the parties in the case, and thus irreversibly jeopardize the defendant’s trial (1,2) . The use of clinical models not adapted to forensic demands may raise issues that are not pertinent to forensic practice and lead to biases on the part of judges and lawyers (6,9-11,13,15) . These characteristics also show h ow psychopathology, as a specific area of knowledge, is not limited to psychiatric assessment and is useful in other areas of knowledge, such as law (13,32-35). Additionally, it is the forensic psychiatrist’s responsib ility to precisely determine the correspondence between psychopathological elements of law and those applied in psychiatry (13,32-35).", "4.1 Limitations", "Our study was based on a sample of defendants in criminal cases (in cust ody or awaiting trial in liberty) in the state of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Similar studies in other states of Brazil are needed for this purpose. Furthermore, regional and cultural factors can affect the validity of the CRS. In this study, the CRS was appli ed by two researchers taking turns in a three -person team. The results were compared to the reports by two official forensic experts at the Heitor Carrilho Forensic Psychiatry Institute. The application of the CRS in other forensic institutes, both in Braz il and in other countries, is essential for improving CRS applicability and the research in this field.", "The research on the CRS by other forensic institutes in Brazil and other jurisdictions is crucial for its refinement. The translation and validation of the CRS in other languages for application in other jurisdictions will also be important for continuing the research in this field.", "4.2 Conclusion", "The CRS revealed objective criteria for determining CU and CD in the assessment of CR. The phenomenological natur e of these LCs precludes an immediately objective determination and requires elements from psychopathology for its objective determination (2,13,32 -35). Our study helps answer the following key question: What are the appropriate criteria of scientificity for subjective psychopathological constructs? Our results point to the analysis of semantic elements that proved to be safe parameters with required sta ndards of scientificity for subjective psychopathological constructs. The analysis of semantic elements may be expanded by future research in this area. Additionally, the CRS proved to be a useful complementary method in forensic assessments of CR, without ruling out an analysis by a forensic expert.", "5 Ethics Statement", "Our research was previously approved by the Institutional Ethical and Research Committee of the Institute of Psychiatry of the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro under protocol no. 68995617. 7.0000.5263.

Method: The present study included 86 defendants undergoing criminal liability evaluation at a criminal investigation institute in Rio de Janeiro between December 2017 and December 2018. Initially, two examiners applied the Psychopathy Checklist -Revised (PCL -R) and collected clinical and sociodemographic data. In the second step, the PCL - R data were compared with the conclusions of an expert.", "Results : The total PCL -R, Factor 1 (interpersonal and affective scale), Factor 2 (antisocial scale), facet 1 (interpersonal ), facet 2 (affective), and facet 4 (antisocial) exhibited satisfactory internal reliability indices. Facet 3 (lifestyle) showed insufficient internal reliability. Facet 4 (antisocial) was the only variable that exhibited statistical significance (p<0.05) when compared with the expert conclusion groups. Paired analysis between the groups exhibited satisfactory indices in the distinction between the non -imputable and the imputable groups and between the non -imputable and the semi -imputable groups. Conclusio n: PCL-R facet 4 (antisocial) exhibited statistical significance for the differentiation between the criminal liability groups according to the conclusions of an expert. These results corroborate with the previous literature, which suggests an increased risk of delinquent conduct and violent behavior in people with antisocial psychopathic traits.", "Keywords : PCL -R, criminal liability, violent behavior, forensic psychiatry, evaluation", "1. INTRODUCTION", "Criminal liability (imputability) can be defined as the degree of culpability to be attributed to a person who has committed an illicit act (Rosner & Scott, 2017; Taborda, 2001). Cancellation or reduction of criminal liability for an offending person is an exception and o ccurs under specific circumstances depending on the legislation in force (Rosner & Scott, 2017). For example, the prac tice of a criminal act by a person whose ability to make a decision (free will) is impaired due to mental illness constitutes a situation of possible decrease in criminal liability or cancellation of criminal liability (Juth & Lorentzon, 2010; Meynen, 2010).", "The criminal laws of diffe rent jurisdictions vary in the degree to which criminal liability is reduced or annulled in cases of crimes committed due to mental illness (American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law [AAPL] et al., 2014; Rosner & Scott, 2017; Taborda, 2001). For example, jurisdictions covered by the M’Naghten Rule provide two possibilities for expert inferences in such cas es: the offending individual is considered wholly responsible (imputable) or wholly irresponsible (non -imputable) for committing an offense ( American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law [AAPL] et al., 2014; Ros ner & Scott, 2017). Other jurisdictions provide for intermediate degrees of criminal imputability (semi -imputability). In Brazil, the current penal code includes three possibilities of expert conclusions with respects to penal liability: imputability, s emi- imputability, and non -imputability.", "The concept of psychopathy is one of the most frequently applied concept in forensic psychiatry in the criminal field (Hare & Neumann, 2008; Roberts & Coid, 2007; Walters, 2004). The Psychopathy Checklist -Revised (PCL -R) is a psychometric instrument that evaluates the degree of psychopathy in individual cases (Hare & Neumann, 2008; Lindberg et al., 2009). The instrument has been extensively researched in the literature , particularly in the investigation of violent behavior and criminal activity (Gray et al., 2003; Harris, Boccaccini, & Rice, 2017; Laurell & Dåderman, 2007). Most of the research on this subj ect includes investigations involving forensic populations undergoing compulsory treatment (violence risk assessment) and investigations regarding criminal recidivism (Burt, Olver, & Wong, 2016; Dolan & Davies, 2006; Flores - Mendoza, Alvarenga, Herrero, & Abad, 2008; Gray, Fitzgerald, Taylor, Macculloch, & Snowden, 2007; Hodgins, Hiscoke, & Freese, 2003; Singh, Grann, & Fazel, 2011; Telles,", "Folino, & Taborda, 2 009, 2012) . Populations undergoing criminal liability testing remain under -researched (Spaans, Barendregt, Haan, Nijman, & de Beurs, 2011). The relevance of investigating the psychopathic construct in the context of criminal liability investigations can be justified by two factors: (a) the possibility of identifying traits of psychopathy in imputable, semi -imputable, and non -imputable defendants (Spaans et al., 2011) and (b) the proximity between the concepts of psychopathy and antisocial personality disorder, with the possibility of concomitant existence of these personality traits in different types of personality disorders according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (fifth edition) alternative model (Hopwood, Thomas, Markon, Wright, & Krueger, 2012).", "The objectives of the present study were: i) to verify the presence of psychopathic traits through the PCL -R in defendants undergoing criminal liability evaluation by comparing the results with the conclusions of an expert (imputable, semi -imputable, and non-imputable) and ii) to stud y the clinical and criminal profiles of this population.", "2. MATERIAL AND METHODS", "Initially, the participants were selected and evaluated by two researchers. Subsequently, they underwent criminal liability evaluation by an expert (Fig. 1). The researchers a nd the experts responsible for the examination acted independently, without exchanging information about the selected participants. The present study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Psychiatry Institute of the Federal University of Rio de Janei ro.", "2.1 Participants", "We selected 86 participants from offenders referred to a criminal liability investigation center (Heitor Carrilho Institute of Forensic Science) in the city of Rio de Janeiro. The participants were selected by convenience between December 2017 and December 2018. Four participants were excluded due to insufficient data to fill out the PCL-R and the sociodemographic questionnaire. The final sample consisted of 82 participants.", "The inclusion criteria were subj ects aged above 18 years; subjects having the ability to read, understand, and sign the informed consent form for participation in the research; and subjects fluent in Portuguese. The exclusion criteria were subjects clinically", "unable to be examined by the experts; subjects unable to read, understand, and sign the informed consent form for participation in the research; and subjects refusing to participate.", "The psychiatric diagnoses of the participants were obtained from the experts’ reports, classified acc ording to the tenth edition of International Classification of Diseases (ICD -10) (Bramer, 1988) . The experts’ diagnoses were used to maintain consistency between the psychiatric diagnoses and the conclusions of the expert responsible for criminal liability investigation. The experts used a semi -structured int erview called “Composite International Diagnostic Interview” for the psychiatric diagnoses (Kessler, Andrews, Mroczek, Ustun, & Wittchen, 1998).", "2.2 Measures", "Initially, the PCL -R was applied by two researchers trained and experienced in the evaluation of psychiatric criminal liability. The researchers jointly interviewed the participants and then researched health files and official records to complet e the PCL -R and the sociodemographic questionnaire. Subsequently, the participants underwent criminal investigation without any exchange of information between the researchers and the responsible expert. Three out of eight official experts from the Heitor Carrilho Institute of Expertise agreed to participate in the study and to allow the use of their expert reports in the research. The criminal liability investigations in this study were conducted by a single expert.", "PCL-R is a psychometric too l for verifying the degree of psychopathy in a specific case (Hare & Neuman n, 2008; Morana, Arboleda -Flórez, & Câmara, 2005). It is originally considered an indirect measure of violent behavior, since many individuals diagnosed with psychopathy commit crimes with characteristics of violence (Hare & Neumann, 2008). PCL-R consists of 20 items. A score of 0 indicates that a particular characteristic is absent, a score of 1 indicates that the characteristic is partially present, and a score of 2 indicates that the characteristic is present (Forth, Brown, Hart, & Hare, 1996; Mor ana et al., 2005). The total score ranges from 0 to 40. PCL -R is subdivided into factors. Factor 1 measures the classical components of psychopathic personality (egocentrism, superficial charm, lack of remorse). Factor 2 measures antisocial factors and unstable lifestyle (impulsiveness, irresponsible behavior, general deviation from the", "norm) (Roberts & Coid, 2007; Telles et al., 2012). Each factor is subdivided into two additional facets. Factor 1 is subdivided into facet 1 and facet 2. Facet 1 is composed of the following items: 1 (loquacity or superficial charm), 2 (overestimation, manipulation), 4 (pathological lie), and 5 (manipulation). Facet 2 (affective) is composed of the following items: 6 (inability to feel remorse or guilt), 7 (emotional insensitivity), 8 (inability to empathize), and 16 (failure to accept liability for their own actions) (Roberts & Coid, 2007; Sohn & Lee, 2014). Factor 2 is subdivided into facet 3 and facet 4. Facet 3 (lifestyle) includes the following items: 3 (eagerness for stimulation/tendency for boredom), 14 (impulsiveness), and 15 (lack of responsibility for their own actions). Facet 4 (antisocial) includes the following items: 10 (disrespect for norms), 12 (conduct disorders in childhood), 13 (absence of realistic long -term goals), 18 (juvenile delinquency), 19 (revocation of prob ation), and 20 (criminal versatility) (Roberts & Coid, 2007; Sohn &", "2.3 Statistical analysis", "PCL-R data (facets, factors, and total score) were compared with the expert’s conclusions using the Kruskal -Wallis test. This test was selected for i ) dealing with ordinal variables and ii) due to the impossibility to accept the normality of the data, which was tested by the Kolmogorov -Smirnov (KS) test. If statistically significant differences were observed in the KS test, Mann -Whitney (MW) test with Bonferroni adjustment was performed for multiple comparisons. Statistically significant results were subjected to the Hedges’ g test to verify the effect size of the sample, since the sample size differed among the three groups. Statistical significance wa s set as p<0.05 and p -values below 0.1 were considered moderately significant. IBM SPSS Statistics version 25 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA) was used for the analyses.", "The following values were considered for the interpretation of the effect size of >1.30 (very large) (Conboy , 2012; Espirito Santo & Daniel, 2015). Only the g -values above 0.50 were considered to obtain results with greater statistical significance.", "3. RESULTS", "Most of the sample was composed of men (82.6%), with a mean age of 37.35± 12.65 years at the time of evaluation and a mean age of 35.00±12.19 years at the time of the crime. Among the participants, 69.8% were released defendants and 50.0% had criminal records. Theft/robbery was the most common crime.", "The mean values of the total PCL-R scores, facets (1, 2, 3, and 4), and factors (1 and 2) in the groups (imputable, semi -imputable, and non -imputable) are summarized in Table 1. The results of the comparison of these groups in terms of the total PCL -R, items, facets, and factors are s ummarized in Table 2. The Hedge’s g test was used to calculate the effect size of the sample for the variables that were significant in the KS test (p<0.05) (Table 2). Subsequently, the findings were detailed for the paired comparison between the expert co nclusion groups and the PCL -R results.", "The only PCL -R variable that contributed to the differentiation among the groups was facet 4 (antisocial). The KS Test indicated at least one significant difference (χ2=7,124; p=0.028) and the MW Test with Bonferroni adjustment revealed that that these differences were present between the non -imputable group and the imputable group (χ2=16,253; p=0.052) and between the non -imputable group and the semi -imputable group (χ2=−22,433; p=0.058). The effect size for these comp arisons was medium (g=0.66) and large (g=1.00), respectively.", "The criminal and clinical profiles of the total sample according to the expert conclusion groups are shown in Tables 3 and 4, respectively. The categories of psychiatric diagnoses according to I CD-10 in the expert conclusion groups are summarized in Table", "4. DISCUSSION", "The results from the present study were relevant for identifying differences between the expert’s conclusions and the PCL -R results in this sample. The scarcity of research inv olving populations undergoing criminal liability evaluation limited the comparison of these results (Spaans et al., 2011) . However, it was possible to compare the results of this study with the results of other researches that used the PCL -R and also with clinical, sociodemographic, and criminological variables (Burt et al., 2016; Gray et al., 2003; Hodgin s et al., 2003; Laajasalo, Salenius, Lindberg, Repo -Tiihonen, & Häkkänen -Nyholm, 2011; Morana et al., 2005; Telles et al., 2009, 2012).", "The mean values of the total PCL -R scores in the sample (Table 1) were lower than those verified in the validation research of this psychometric instrument for the Portuguese language (Morana et al., 2005) . In the present study, all participants were cla ssified according to Hare’s criteria for psychopathy and were subsequently subdivided into two subgroups: global personality disorder (GPD) and partial personality disorder (PPD) (Morana et al., 2005) . Hare’s classification of psychopathy showed that all defendants who were con sidered psychopaths met the diagnostic criteria for antisocial personality disorder (ASPD). However, not all defendants diagnosed with ASPD met the criteria for psychopathy (Hare & Neumann, 2008). In general, the GPD and PPD groups differed in terms of severity of psychopathy. The GPD subgroup exhibited greater severity of psychopathy than the PPD group.", "In the PCL -R validation study for the Portuguese language, the mean value of the total PCL -R score was 28.63, the mean score for Factor 1 was 13.12 (± 2.26), and the mean score for Factor 2 was 12.32 (±4.17) (Morana et al., 2005) . The relatively lower scores of these variables in the present study can be justified by the absence of participants diagnosed with antisocial personality. However, the proximity of the mean total PCL -R score ( 13.30±7.48 ) in the present study with the lower limit of the standard deviation of the mean total PCL-R score in the PPD subgroup ( 18.09±2.68 ) from the validation study may indicate the presence of participants with traits of psychopathy without the diagnosis of ASPD (Morana et al., 2005) .", "The PCL -R results in the present sample corroborate the results in the literature. A meta -analysis reported the greater importance of PCL-R Factor 2 in the occurrence of violent behavior in individuals diagnosed with a mental disorder (Yang, Wong, & Coid, 2010). The results of the present study showed higher Factor 2 scores compared to Factor 1 scores in participants with and without the diagnosis of mental disorder (Table 1). These findings reinforce Hare ’s construct of psychopathy and the possibility of verifying traits of psychopathy in different mental disorder groups (Hare & Neumann, 2008; Hopwood A Brazilian study researched the prevalence of violent behavior relapses in a sample of inmates undergoing compulsory psychiatric treatment (Telles et al., 2012) . The PCL-R scores obtained in this population were similar to those observed in the present sample. The aforementioned study reported a total PCL -R score of 13.54 (±9.99 ), Fac tor 1 score of 5.78 (±5.15 ), and Factor 2 score of 6.73 (±4.26 ). In the present study, the total", "PCL-R score was 13.30 (±7.48 ), Factor 1 score was 3.88 (±3.84 ), and Factor 2 score was 7.80 (±4.23 ). The timing of the PCL -R application (cessation of dangerousness assessment in the aforementioned study and cessation of the criminal liability test in the present study) may explain the small variations in Factor 1 and Factor 2 scores. Moreover, participants from the aforementioned study received correcti ve psychiatric treatment, while participants in the present research did not receive such treatment (Telles et al., A Dutch study compa red PCL -R results with expert conclusions regarding criminal liability (Spaans et al., 2011) . This study had a bigger sample than the present study (n=108 vs. n=82). The Dutch jurisdiction provides five types of expert conclusions for penal liability (PL) with three intermediaries (total imputability, slightly reduc ed imputability, severely reduced imputability, and non -liability) (Spaans et al., 2011) . In the present study, the mean total PCL -R score for the imputable group (13.81±7.88) (Table 1) was similar to the that observed by Spaans et al. (13.98±8.4) in the total imputability group (Spaans et al., 2011) . These data suggest that the characteristics of psychopathy are common betwe en totally imputable (imputable by the Brazilian penal code) offenders with psychiatric diagnosis and totally imputable offenders without psychiatric diagnosis. In the non -imputable group (which was not included in the present study), the mean PCL -R score (12.80±5.2) was lower than that observed by Spaans et al. (15.63±6.4). However, the mean values of both the scores were covered by their respective standard deviations (Spaans et al., 2011) .", "Facet 1 (interpersonal) exhibited lower mean scores in the non -imputable group (1.40±2.3) and in the imputable group (1.95±2. 50) compared to the non -imputable (1.85±1.7) and the totally imputable (2.23±2.50) groups, respectively from the study by Spaans et al. (Spaans et al., 2011) . Similar results were observed for facet 2 (affective), which also exhibited lower mean scores in the non -imputable group (3.00±2.17) and in the imputable grou p (2.15±2.22) compared to the non -imputable (4.62±1.9) and the totally imputable (4.62±2.7) groups, respectively from the study by Spaans et al. (Spaans et al., 2011) . Facet 4 (antisocial) showed higher mean scores in the non -imputable group (4.20±2.33) and in the imputable group (4.17±2.51) compared to the non -impu table (3.04±2.0) and the totally imputable (2.40±2.7) groups, respectively from the study by Spaans et al. (Spaans et al., 2011) . It was not possible to compare facet 3 (lifestyle), since this variable did not exhibit satisfactory indices in the present study. Characteristics", "related to the surveyed population or th e sample size possibly resulted in the absence of internal reliability for this variable (Table 2).", "Comparison of the results between the intermediate expert conclusion group and the five intermediate expert conclusion groups from the Dutch jurisdiction (s lightly reduced liability, reduced liability, and severely reduced liability) was limited by the impossibility of accurately matching these terminologies (Spaans et al., 2011) . However, it is worth noting that the total PCL -R scores in the three intermediate criminal liability groups in the Dutch study were higher t han those observed in the the semi -imputable group from the present study (11.42±7.68) (Table 1). This result can be justified by the low number of participants in the non -imputable group in the present study (n=10) and the absence of participants with the diagnosis of ASPD. In the study by Spaans et al., the higher number of participants with the diagnosis of ASPD may explain the higher mean value of the total PCL -R score in the intermediate groups of PL compared to the groups with total imputability (impu table group) and non -imputability (non -imputable group) (Spaans et al., 2011) . In the present study, only 12 participants were considered semi - imputable and no participant was diagnosed with ASPD.", "Facet 4 (antisocial) exhibited moderate significance (p<0.1) in the distinction between the non -imputable and the imput able groups (mean effect size) and in the distinction among the non -imputable, the semi -imputable, and the imputable groups (large effect size) (Table 2). Interestingly, this variable was more relevant in distinguishing the expert conclusion groups with de creased criminal liability (non - imputable and semi -imputable groups). These data may indicate the importance of the presence of clinical characteristics of psychopathic traits in the distinction of these expert conclusion groups. In the study by Spaans et al., no statistically significant difference was observed between the total PCL -R score and its facets in the distinction of the criminal liability groups (Spaans et al., 2011) . The existence of five expert conclusion groups for PL (three intermediate groups) interfered with these results (Spaans et al., 2011) . In this context, it is appropriate for forensic psychiatrists to question the technical feasibility of verifying different intermediate degrees of PL (Mohíno, Pujol, & Idiaquez, 2011; Spaans et al., 2011). The legal provision for different intermediate degrees of PL might hind er its technical identification by the expert.", "Reportedly, facet 4 (antisocial) of the PCL -R is strongly associated with violent outcomes (Yang et al., 2010) . Items included in this facet (uncontrolled conduct, conduct", "problems in childhood, juvenile delinquency, loss of probation, and criminal versatility) may represent clinical characteristic s associated with increased risk of violence in patients with psychiatric diagnoses other than ASPD (Abushua'leh & Abu -Akel, 2006; Laajasalo et al., 2011). The present study confirms these findings, since 68.8% of the participants exhibited violent behavior during the practice of the crime (Table 5) and only 23.1% were not diagnosed with psychiatric disorders at the time of the crime (Table 6). The present study has some limitations. It included a small sample of defendants subjected to criminal liability evaluation. The data showed no characteristics of statistical normality. Hence, parametric tests could not be performed. No inter -examiner reli ability test was performed for PCL -R application.", "5. CONCLUSION", "The PCL -R exhibited variables with statistical significance in the comparison of criminal liability groups according to the expert’s conclusions. Particularly, the items in facet 4 (antisocia l) contributed to the distinction among the expert conclusion groups of PL. The results of this study showed a lower incidence of psychopathic characteristics in individuals classified into the intermediate criminal liability groups . These findings may encourage future research to verify specific clinical and personality characteristics related to intermediate degrees of criminal liability.", "REFERENCES Abushua’leh, K., & Abu -Akel, A.

A identificação de elementos clínicos que sejam de maior propensão à ocorrência de comportamento violento, em um settin g clínico, pode contribuir ao planejamento terapêutico com a adoção de medidas clínicas que visem diminuir este risco específico, para proteger potenciais vítimas (familiares, outros pacientes, profissionais da equipe terapêutica). A prevenção de comportam ento violento em uma população psiquiátrica em tratamento hospitalar pode evitar a ocorrência de desfechos negativos , potencialmente capazes de configurar atos delitivos . No segundo artigo foram abordados potenciais vieses capazes de justificar a elevada discordância entre examinadores na avaliação de um mesmo caso em perícias criminais. A identificação de vieses relacionados às avaliações psiquiátricas em perícias criminais contribui para a melhoria do padrão técnico -pericial e beneficia os elementos probatórios incluídos em um processo judicial.", "No terceiro artigo, foi verificada a validade do modelo teórico referente às CLs de entendimento e de determinação, autorizadas no código penal brasileiro, através da validação do EIP. Esse fato agrega elementos de cientificidade à avaliação pericial de responsabilidade penal e à psicopatologia forense, colocando -a em um patamar técnico aos tradicionalmente aplicados nas perícias criminais. O modelo fatorial validado no EIP pode contribuir ao esclarecimento de cas os limítrofes, assim como trazer elementos de imparcialidade à conclusão pericial.", "No quarto artigo, buscou -se por elementos de tecnicidade à identificação dos diferentes grupos de conclusão pericial (imputável, semi -imputável e inimputável) através do PC L-R. Nossa pesquisa verificou possíveis elementos de psicopatia capazes de individualizar os grupos de conclusão pericial. Entretanto, a confirmação dos nossos resultados demanda a realização de pesquisas futuras e com uma amostra mais abrangente.", "Todos os trabalhos incluídos nessa tese trazem resultados que, em conjunto, contribuem ao aprimoramento técnico e científico da psiquiatria forense , marcadamente através de instrumentos psicométricos . O aprimoramento dos parâmetros técnicos adotados na psiqui atria forense, em especial nas perícias de responsabilidade penal com a utilização de IP especificamente desenvolvidos à avaliação de CL, agrega elementos de cientificidade à técnica de avaliação pericial.

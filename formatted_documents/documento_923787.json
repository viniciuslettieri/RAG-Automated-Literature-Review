This research was organized through the format of three papers , the first being theoretical and the other two empirical. While in the first article a of non -traditional literature review of 170 scientific papers was carried out using mixed methods of analysis such as bibliometrics and qualitative content a nalysis, in the 2nd and 3rd papers were used qualitative methodologies such as the case study, which included a total of 38 in -depth interviews with companies and entities affected by the phenomenon being studied , which together formed the cases of Rio 201 6 and Tokyo 2020. As a result, three theoretical frameworks emerged in a better way to understand (1) the logic behind investment flows in the context of mega -events; (2) new competitive pressures from specific industry sectors most affected by the Olympic Games; and (3) threats and trends that are likely to affect the future of the Olympic movement . As a conclusion of the study, we verified that the gigantism assumed by past editions has put a lot of pressure over organizers and companies for new managemen t practices and better planning over its investments , in a way to ensure not only a minor impact of the event on the environment, but also an economic sustainability of the Olympics and other international mega sporting events.", "Keywords : Olympic Games ; Olympic Investments ; Rio 2016 ; Tokyo 2020 ; Investment sustainability.", "LIST OF IMAGES", "Page Section 2 Figure 1 – Number of articles per year 50 Figure 2 – Frequent terms 51 Figure 3 – Word dendrogram 52 Figure 4 – The direct investment flows in big events context 63", "Section 3 Graph 1 – Rio de Janeiro numbers of rooms during the years 86 Figure 1 – Olympic clusters Rio 2016 87 Figure 2 – Model of competitive pressures in traditional hospitality 94", "Section 4 Image 1 – Treats and trends of the Olympic Movement 117", "Section 5 Figure 1 – The direct investment flows in big events context 130 Figure 2 – Model of competitive pressures in traditional hospitality 134 Figure 3 – Treats and trends of the Olympic Movement 136 Figure 1 – The direct investment flows in big events context 140", "LIST OF TABLES", "Page Section 1 Table 1 – Guiding concepts 34", "Section 2 Table 1 – Theoretical propositions 61 Table 2 – Summary of the literature explored 68", "Section 3 Table 1 – Key theoretical concepts 80 Table 2 – Interviews 82", "Section 4 Table 1 – IOC 2020 Agenda 104 Table 2 – IOC 2020+5 Agenda 105 Table 3 – Interviews 105 Table 4 – Trends correlations 109 Table 5 – Interaction of the variables 123", "Section 5 Table 1 – Theoretical propositions 131", "LIST OF ACRONYMS", "ABIH – Brazilian Association of the Hotel Industry BBC – British Broadcasting Corporation BRL – Brazilian Reais CBS – Columbia Broadcasting System COVID -19 – Coronavirus Disease 2019 DOI – Digital Object Identifier EMBRATUR – Brazilian Agency for International Tourism Promotion ESG – Environmental, Sustainability and Governance EXL – Exel FDI – Foreign Direct Investments FIFA – International Federation of Football Association FIRJAN – Federation of Industries of the State of Rio de Janeiro GDP – Gross Domestic Product ICMS – Tax on the Circulation of Goods and Services IIF – Institute of I nternational Finance IOC – International Olympic Committee IPTU – Urban Building and Land Tax ISS – Tax on Services ISSN – International Standard Serial Number IT – Information Technology JETRO – Japan External Trade Organization JLL – Jones Lang LaSalle Incorporated JNTO – Japan National Tourism Organization LGBT – Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender MS – Microsoft OECD – Organization for Economic Co -operation and Development OGGI – Olympic Games Global Impact PDF – Portable Document Format SMEs – Small and Medium Enterprises UN – United Nations UNCTAD - United Nations Conference on Trade and Development US – United States", "USBC – United States -China Business Council USD – United States Dollar WHO – World Health Organization WSL – Wall Str eet Journal", "SUMMARY", "Page Section 1 – Thesis introduction 17 4.3 Olympic Games growing complexity and the necessity for a more sustainable model 29", "Section 2 – Foreign Direct Investment and Olympic Games: A Systematic Literature Review 41", "Section 3 – The Mega Events Paradox: Analyzing the Behavior of the Hospitality Industry in the City of Rio de Janeiro During and After the Olympics 71", "Section 4 – COVID -19, Sustainability and Olympic Games: Which Lessons we can Take from Tokyo 2020*? 99", "Section 5 – Thesis final considerations 129", "References 146", "SECTION 1 – Thesis introduction", "1. Research context", "Assuming that over the years the cost of hosting the Olympic Games has considerably increased creating a growing disinterest of potential hosting cities, this research aims to investigate the logic behind the investments of companies and governments in meg a events contexts, especially regarding how has the business environment operating under the logic of the Olympic Games had been mobilizing and attracting long -term equity investments over the years . To this end, the last two Summer Olympic Games were anal yzed: Rio in 2016 and more recently Tokyo in 2021, a singular edition that ended up taking place just in the middle of one of the biggest pandemics in recent human history. As a timeframe for analysis, the focus was to observe the pre -event moment, so that we could monitor the cities preparation from the BID1 as well their legacy expectations. In the case of Rio specifically, were also possible to evaluate the post -event situation, that certainly brought additional challenges to the region especially due to the retraction of the investments commonly presented after the ending of a mega -event cycle. As a result, most of the episodes presented here took place between the years of 2009 and Although Rio de Janeiro and Tokyo, Brazil and Japan are very dis tant examples of a possible comparison in terms of culture and institutions , both cities had clear problems in hosting their Olympics. While Tokyo had to deal with an Olympic postponement and a Games behind closed doors just in the middle of social isolati on period, in Rio de Janeiro most of the problems seems to have occurred after the event had finished. Whether due to political -institutional instability or the health crisis, the issue is that the two cases brought additional complications for companies a nd organizations that invested in both events . As the most affected, we can highlight companies in the area of tourism, hospitality and services. As those businesses have been historically impacted by mega -events due to the increase in the flow of tourists , many organizations end up committing large amounts of resources during these cycles (Pires et al., 2012 ). But if well planned , mega -events can present several benefits for the hosting regions. Milan (2016) presented the successful examples of past host cities like Barcelona in Spain (1992), Atlanta in the United States (1996) and Sidney in Australia (2000).", "years to be concluded, and happens 9 years before the Olympic edition.", "According to the Author (Milan , 2016) , all those Cities had experienced that a large contribution of investments was able to bring accelerated econom ic growth to the locations most affected by the Games, and also exponentially reduce the unemployment rates and positively transform the lifestyle of the local population. Considered one of the Olympic cases of most success in history, Barcelona in the yea rs leading up to the Games saw your employed population grow in 72%, with the peak being one year before the event (Milan , 2016) .", "The ability of the Olympic Games in creating jobs were also highlighted by Proni et al., (2008). According to the authors, in the period between October 1986 and July 1992 the general unemployment rate in Barcelona fell from 18.4% to 9.6% (against 15.5% in the rest of Spain). The curve for the number of registered unemployed had an inflection point in 1986, when went from 127,774 people unemployed in November 1986 (the month following the Olympic nomination) to 60,885 in July 1992 (during the Olympic Games). The main part of these positions was created for projects of infrastructure responsible for promoting significant changes in the City’s urban spaces, with an increase of 15% in road projects, 17% in sewage treatment systems, in addition to a 78% increase in green areas and beaches, and 268% in lakes and fountains only between 1989 and 1992. During this same period, the sectors that presented the greatest growth were parking lots, housing, retail outlets, offices and hotels, which demonstrates a presence not only of public but also private investments responsible for operates an entire supporting event infrastructure as the ones mentioned above. As an example, only considering the years before 1992 the City saw an increasing of 58,5% on its hosting capacity. But the investment brought by the Games were not only restricted to the City area, once only 38.5% of Olympic investments w ere made in Barcelona, while 61.5% of the projects were carried out outside the City, whether in the metropolitan region (29%), in the rest of Catalonia Province (16%), or elsewhere in Spain (20%). Among the infrastructure sectors that received the biggest investments in the country we could highlight the urban mobility with 56 million dollars, offices and commerce (20 million), communication services (18 million), hospitality (17 million), sports (13 million) and environment (9 million) in values of that t ime (Proni et al., 2008).", "In terms of the socioeconomic transformation of a host city, Barcelona would have been the first to use the Olympic Games as a strategy for accomplish major urban projects and interventions. Part of this success are based in the c ity's ability to coordinate actions and resources between public and private initiatives. With an unprecedented ratio of 65%", "of public money versus 35% private (where 1/3 of that percentage came from foreign capital), Barcelona managed to overcome the prob lem of fundraising that such a large project may have. But far beyond the positive impacts and legacies left to the city, they were able to transform the region into a tourist and economic center of great relevance in a short period, making Barcelona a Wor ld-class City, and a model that has served as a reference for the other Olympic Cities that have followed since then (Mendes, 2017). Examples of the past like Barcelona have shown the capacity of a mega event to promote the hosting regions, increasing its international representativeness, valuing the local culture, in addition to a greater attraction of foreign investment to the region (Carvalho., & Tang, 2014). In the other hand, not always the socioeconomic benefits and legacy left by an Olympic Game can be positive. In contrast we have the case of the Athens Games in 2004, that despite being important to bring a cultural rescue to the nation where the Olympic spirit had begun, the Greek government announced a final cost of the project with a budget almos t the double of the initially estimated, in addition of having experienced a pre - and post -Olympic period of debt increase and shrinking GDP. The 2004 Games would also be marked as the presage of the Greek crisis, where in 2010 the State's debt reached 144 .9% of GDP, compared to the observed 77% in the 2000s (Karatassou, 2015). In the occasion, the country had to be rescued by other members of the European Union, in order to avoid the break of the local monetary standard and the decree of a moratorium.", "2. Relevance of the study", "Even with positive and negative aspects of hosting an Olympics, it is common to have a great expectation right after the Olympic nomination. The possibility of socioeconomical legacies allowed by the investments that mega -events co uld bring to the hosting regions would directly affect the lives of citizens, with the transformation of the urban mobility, tourism, cultural infrastructure and sports of the city. But for this being possible, first of all is necessary that companies and governments be willing to afford with large amounts (billions of dollars ) of long -term equity investments in the local market (Wolffenbüttel, 2006), numbers that among the years had been considerably increasing. If in the Barcelona Games (1992) were possib le to observe investments of USD 7 billion, in the Winter Games of Nagano (1992) this numbers were already USD 15.2 billion, reaching up to US$ 16 billion in Athens (2004), US$ 45 billion in Beijing", "(2008), and US$ 51 billion in Sochi (2014), where were re gistered the most expensive Olympics in history (C ouncil of Foreign Relations , 2019).", "In this context, between 2009 and 2013 the Olympic journey of Rio and Tokyo respectively began, a period of 7 years of preparation where the eyes of investors around the world are usually focused on the Olympic cities (Athayde et al. 2013). Despite the great challenges involved in hosting an Olympics, several business opportunities would be possible and were conditioned, at that time, to the planning that the country and the city would do to create a business environment favorable to investments. But mainly because the attention of the international media that the hosting regions use to receive, sensitive issues that have always been part of local life like public security , institutional instability, rights of minorities, and many others, could be both optimized and hurt the destination image of the country, even putting in risk the success of the Games and their long-term intangible legacy (Garcia and Pereira, 2018).", "Due to the context of political, economic and sanitary crisis that has intensified in the world in the last two years, this work, although it focuses on specific cases now already in the past, has practical implications since this event is recurrent, and is re peated every two years if we consider the Olympic summer and winter editions. With this, the results of this study, in addition to contributing to the business area that deals with business investments in mega events contexts, also will give us a better un derstanding of the importance of governments and institutions in moments of crisis as in Tokyo . This reflection will allow that new correlated research themes emerge to guide future studies, but also contributes to the decision -making process of companies and institutions who are willing to make investments in the next Olympic cities or regions affected by mega events – being they in emerging locations (like was the case of Brazil), or also in developed ones (Japan).", "Some other authors such as Brunet (1995) , Owen (2005), and Preuss (2008) have studied over the years the impacts of mega events, especially the Olympics, on the economy of the host locations. Even so, not all studies were conclusive in order to observe the real impacts of the Olympic Games on na tional economies, thus exposing a substantial research horizon to be explored. However, there isn’t so many studies that are concerned with behavior of specific sectors of the market within this context of mega events. Especially before 2008, when the Beij ing Olympic Games took place, there was practically no literature discussing mega events in contexts in emerging countries, as pointed out by Tien, Lo and Li (2011). With that, although we have advanced a lot in the", "discussion of the topic in the last deca de, there is still a gap to be covered by the literature, mainly regarding to the incentive policies that local governments living under mega events contexts, implement in order to attract new investments to regions and sectors of strategic interest. Now w ith the COVID -19, understand the changes that mega events will have to promote in their model becomes even more relevant in a reality of investment restriction due to the deterioration of the political and economic situation in several countries around the world.", "Even though monitoring the transformations that happens in the economy due to mega sporting events may be an interesting phenomenon to observe by itself, the present work had for objective promote a more complete analysis from a micro (Case 1) and macro (Case 2) perspective, which take into account not only specific industries, but also the actions of governments and international organizations responsible for influencing the direction of mega events around the world. Thus, Rio and Tokyo should be understood here not as comparative examples, but as complementary cases. This can be said since in periods of crisis and growing disinterest in what was once one of the most desired events in the world, it is necessary that each time more companies, organi zations and governments plan well their investments, considering that the availability of resources for such long -term projects as required by the Olympic infrastructure, are each time shorter.", "3. Research questions", "Assuming that over the years the cost of hosting the Olympic Games has considerably increased (CFR, 2019), creating a growing disinterest of potential hosting cities, considering the current risks of investing in an Olympic agenda (Flyvbjerg et al., 2020) , the present study has as main and sec ondary research objectives the questions below:", " How has the business environment in the context of the Olympic Games had been mobilizing and attracting long -term equity investments?", " How has the literature been discussing over the years the themes of dire ct investment and Olympic Games in different realities?  How did specific sectors of the industry as tourism and hospitality behave, in terms of organic growth and investments, during Olympic cycles?", " How the financial sustainability theme has been incorporated into the new Olympic agenda, especially since the impact of the pandemic on the Tokyo 2020 Games?", "4. Theoretical references", "4.1 Economic aspects of the decision over investments", "Several aspects can be taken into consideration during the dec ision -making process about choosing the type and location of investments. If, on the one hand, behavioral issues inherent to the investor's background and profile can be decisive, many times the opportunity for economic return of a given project or context may even overcome situations of high risk observed by companies. The first works concerned with evaluating these issues are almost contemporary to those that defend behavioral issues, and appeared in the late 1970s and 1980s with authors such as Hymer (19 76), Buckley, Buckley and Casson, in their book of 1985 and later in 1998 talk about the concept that firms are able to evaluate the costs involved at each stage of the production chain, and thus choose a series of locations where the total average cost of production is minimized. This production cost would be influenced by several market factors that affect gains of scale, available technology, standardization rates, better raw material prices, lower labor costs, taxes, among others. In addition to these external variables, it is important that the decisions over the investment is also lined up with the firm's internal characteristics such as production, marketing and research and development are w ell integrated. Furthermore, it is important to remember that there are still unpredictable external factors, such as sudden government interventions, natural disasters, economic crises, among others, that can affect strategic planning, considering that we occupy markets with different characteristics.", "Another important concept is the markets internalization (Rugman, 1985) , where companies, motivated by the risks and delays generated by the imperfections of the markets, would make a comparative analysis bet ween the effects of internalization and the costs involved. With that, in situations where the benefits were greater there would be the internalization of operations beyond their domestic borders, which would result in the creation of a multinational. In o ther words, corporations would start to carry out the operations that the market performs inefficiently internally, thus taking advantage of the", "opportunities generated by imperfections of the markets. Companies would also have a set of differentiated comp etencies called specific factors2, which would guarantee them a competitive advantage over competitors. Thus, the authors also explains that a lower location cost in the foreign market, combined with price differentials and market barriers, would lead corp orations to abandon, for example, direct exports in order to internalize a specific market, and thereby improve their local understanding about the same.", "In 1983, Kogut inspired on the studies of Hymer (1976), presented the perspective of direct investment to the discussion by saying that there would be a sequential investment process after the entry of a company in a certain market. In the case of multinationals, there would be greater flexibility when transferring large amounts between different subsidiar ies and this would bring a competitive advantage to corporations with these characteristics. The author also calls the attention for the difference between the motivations generated in the first movement and the subsequent ones, being the quantity of movem ents an advantage for those already in the system. Furthermore, there would be three basic indicators capable of influencing the decision for expansion of multinationals. We can mention: (1) the possibility of avoid institutional restrictions such as embar goes and antitrust policies; (2) competitive advantage generated by the possibility of gaining economies of scale and pioneering spirit; (3) and the option to strategically chose the location for the company's operations of marketing, production and resear ch and development.", "In 1989, Buckley published a study that for the first time discuss the performance of small and medium -sized enterprises (SMEs) in direct investments, and indicates some concepts that would help to understand the behavior of these grou ps, which often act together with other groups of smaller companies or end up following the movement of large corporations. In this specific group of SMEs, in the most of the time there would be a limitation of people and available resources, and this dyna mic would lead most of the times to a limited market planning and analysis. These characteristics would make the decisions over the entry mode and intended market most of the time conditioned to the managers' personal perceptions and experiences, and this situation could lead to difficulties in the process of fixation and expansion of the companies.", "2 Below we list the specific factors together with some examples: factors specifi c to the industry (product, market structure, suppliers, competitors); to the region (availability of raw materials, social and geographical distance); to the nation (fiscal and political structure of each country); and the firm (the company's ability to c ommunicate abroad and deal with complexities inherent to intellectual property).", "Based on this concept, the author further suggests that this possibility of imperfect analysis would tend to generate limited opportunities, and with this, the companies would initially seek small investments, and would only be willing to increase their levels of resource commitment as they were getting return from the initial investment. Presented by Dunning in 1980, what became known as the Eclectic Paradigm pr oposes a model to explain the production, shape and pattern of business across borders, even helping to identify and evaluate factors that influence the decision -making process and the production growth of the companies. At this point is important to say t hat Dunning insisted that it was not a theory or a model, but a framework where theories and models could be built.", "Associating several economic questions such as the limited amount of resources, transaction costs and market imperfections, the Eclectic Par adigm also conditions the pattern of production to three perceived advantages. At this moment, the model presents the advantages of ownership, which can be reduced to exclusivity in ownership a group of assets or the ability to coordinate them more efficie ntly than the competitor. The second key-concept would be the advantages of internalizing processes, which aim to mitigate problems arising from the use of intermediaries, and the greater gain on the production chain and proximity to the customer. By the e nd would also have the location advantages, which aim to gain competitive advantage by using cheaper labor or raw material, tax incentives, geographic proximity, among others.", "In this view, the product negotiated should have some comparative advantage in relation to those already in the receiving market, among which we can mention as an example, the preferential access to raw material, patents, economies of scale, diversification, among others. Secondly, the direct investment should only occur in situations where the perceived risk and uncertainty is lower than the benefits, because from the perspective of an imperfect market, the integration of different stages of the value chain, diversification of the product line or capturing economies of scale in comple mentary products, could justify the movement. Finally, the decision on where to invest should always take into account locations where there is an opportunity for leverage, reduction of perceived risk, gains through cost optimization and increase in the product transfer price.", "Dunning (1988) reaffirm the correlation between the advantages of ownership, internalization and location, and its ability to explain companies expansions. There was also at this moment, a subdivision of the advantages of ownership in two new categories,", "these being the structural advantages that refer to the ownership of assets or tacit knowledge by the corporation, and the transaction advantages related to the arrangements between the different links in the value chain that the compa ny owns. Although they vary according to the region, segment of industry or activity in which the firm operates, companies that better exploit these properties would have a greater capacity to be successful in their operation and expansion strategies.", "4.2 Institutions, markets and incentives", "In 2001 and 2003 (Dunning), and more recently in 2010 (Dunning., & Lundan) revisits his theory since the original model did not fully covered the emerging localities, regions that were gaining more and more internation al representativeness, even becoming the destination of the main international sporting mega -events. Because of this, the author points out the changes in the characteristics of the corporation's performance in the middle of the international context that has changed a lot since the 1970s and 1980s due to globalization. With these changes, starts to verify the importance of institutional issues, as in the case of the actions of governments and institutions of the hosting country, which would be increasingly decisive for the decision -making process about the business. This new model, which now takes institutional aspects of both the country of origin and the hosting location, offered an advance in the understanding of how companies behave in the international scenario, with regard to their investment options, choice of region, use of local partners, among others (Peng; Wang and Jiang, 2008).", "Stoian (2013) already called attention to the increase on the investment flow to emerging markets, and brings as an exam ple the countries of the south hemisphere and the post -Soviet economies, which those last ones, despite having converted to capitalism in the early 1990s, they still brought with them an entire institutional structure from the times of the Soviet Union. St ill in this context, Silva -Rêgo and Figueira (2019) analyzed the Brazilian institutional structure and privileged access to the federal government by a range of national companies in the civil construction segment. Over the years, the “close” relationship that this group of companies maintained with the local authorities gave them access to technical, diplomatic support and preferential credit lines, which were able to guarantee the performance and expansion of their activities on projects across the countr y and internationally. In some cases, the government used the international presence of these companies to fortify political and commercial relations with other foreign governments.", "One of the references of the New Institutional Economy, North (1990), who despite recognizing the importance of market forces in economic development, argues that institutions play a central role in the interaction with the firm and its behavior in the market. According to the author, institutions can be interpreted as the rules of a certain game, which determine what players can or cannot do. These institutions would also be subdivided into two groups, the first being composed of written laws, generally imposed by a government, and the second by norms or codes of conduct, create d by the informal rules of coexistence that can be found on the societies.", "The institutional theory proposed by North (1990) also assumes the existence of an economic and social environment surrounded by uncertainties, being the transaction costs the main consequence of those uncertainties, which may be higher or lower when operating in certain markets. In order to reduce these costs and coordinate human and market activities, societies would have developed a set of rules, or institutions. These institution s could interact with present characteristics of different natures, such as economic, political or social, which would be responsible for interacting with each other to reduce the transaction costs of a given society. It is also interesting to note from th e theory that this order would not be static, and there would be the possibility of observing an evolution of institutions and a decrease in transaction costs over time.", "Other authors of this current such as Willianson (1975), Hoskisson; et al., (2000) and Dumludag, Saridogan and Kurt (2007) also use concepts from previous theories such as the already mentioned transaction costs, in addition to market imperfections and limited rationality, to explain the dynamics of the economic / institutional environment and the internal functioning of organizations. On the other hand, Kostova (1999), will say that the greater the differences between the institutions in the country of origin and the destination, the greater the difficulties encountered by the firm in fixin g theirselves locally, managing its operations and transferring knowledge. This concept also supports the general idea that lower observed institutional distances would favor the adoption of models with greater commitments of resources, such as the presenc e of direct investments. While in situations of a higher institutional distance, the firm would choose for entry modes with a less resource commitment, as in licensing and franchising situations (Meyer et al., 2008). In this sense, international mega sport ing events could be understood here as one of these market anomalies (Cui, Kolokolova, & Wang, 2019), responsible for influencing the institutional environment of the hosting regions", "It is worth calling attention at this point to the fact that institutiona l distance is something perceived, and tends to vary according to the characteristics of the manager and company that evaluate it. Below we highlight some factors of the hosting country identified by Rocha and Ávila (2015), which should be considered when assessing institutional distance in an expansion plan. In the regulatory pillar, we would have the level of government intervention, degree of protectionism, restrictions on foreign investment, and the quality of the legal outline. On the other hand, for t he normative pillar, we could highlight the values, relationships of trust, corruption and the bureaucratic mentality, as for the cultural -cognitive pillar, some relevant factors would be the stereotypes, manager’s practices and the sociocultural identity of the host location. Some empirical studies already have identified the influence of the institutional variable on decisions over direct investment decisions, which is usually more prominent in regions known as emerging, as Mshelia and Anchor (2018) prese nted when studying the disposition of foreign multinationals on the African continent. The authors identified that political -institutional issues are being even more taken into consideration by companies; however, there is a specific inflection point for e ach of the projects, where the economic attractiveness can overcome the institutional distance observed and make the investment worth. Stevens, Xie and Peng (2015) studied the case of multinational information technology companies in China and the influenc es of political risk in their expansion and fixation process. This study proposes the creation of a model that helps other companies to plan internal policies capable of mitigating political risk in scenarios of institutional uncertainty. The authors also highlight that even though this phenomenon has been transformed over the last few years and acquired new formats, will be one of the real challenges for the multinational corporation of the contemporary world. With this, the events brought by COVID -19 from 2020, and the way in which governments reacted to the crisis, can also be understood as determinants of institutional uncertainty across countries.", "In the other hand, Adams, Régibeaue and Rockett (2014), have already drawn attention to the various incenti ves that governments have been making to create an institutional environment favorable to direct investment and job creation. According to the authors, these incentives can be both for regions and specific industry sectors considered strategic. The creatio n of an institutional environment favorable to certain sectors or groups of companies, despite violating some free market rules, has been widely practiced over the years by governments around the world. The most common incentive", "is on taxation, with the re duction of taxes or tariffs for certain segments. However, in some other cases it is possible to verify other normative subsidies, as in the case of changing laws to make the activities of some industries more fluid or less bureaucratic. Incentives were al so very important in times of crisis, in order to prevent an abrupt reduction in the investments level due to the drop in demand and business uncertainty. With regard to the Olympic Games, it has been observed a predominance of these incentive policies, es pecially in emerging countries, in order to make the region more attractive for investors (Weiss, 2012). In general, in order to mitigate the weakness of the institutional environment, many countries have been used on economic and fiscal incentives so that they become part of a location advantage, allowing a better adaptation of firms, especially foreign ones (Silva -Rêgo, & Figueira, 2019). The most observed incentives to attract investment from private firms have been, for local capital, the privatization of state -owned companies, and for international capital, lines of credit and financing, insurance, in addition to tax and regulatory incentives (Gorynia et al., 2015). However, Tavares -Lehmann (2016), discuss about the risk of living in an economy of incen tives. According to the author, in some markets this practice, which should had been an exception, ended up becoming a rule. The big problem would be the fact that many times these incentives are indiscriminate, that is, they do not select companies that w ould be able to better contribute to the local socioeconomic development, eventually attracting several bad investments when taking into account the interests of local society. Another problem identified in the permanence of these policies is that in most cases they are not able to support economic crises or help companies to recover, since in times of low economic activity, it is common to observe tax deficits on the public agencies and the need to increase revenue, entering with that on a negative spiral of deficits.", "In a world that lives under a logic of limited availability of resources, it would be common to see competition between different regions in terms of attracting new investments. In emerging regions, which usually present greater risks for inve stors, especially institutional ones, it is possible to widely observe the use of incentives, as pointed out by Anderson and Sutherland (2015). In the case of Brazil, it is possible to identify even a competition between the different provinces, which beca me known as “Tax War”, which consists of bringing down the value of the main province tax (ICMS) for some sectors in order to attract new companies to the region. A recent example presented by the Reuters (2019) was that with the reduction of the ICMS over the aviation", "fuel from 25% to 12%, the province of São Paulo (Brazil) would now receive extra 490 weekly flights, since the airlines would be migrating their routes to be able to refuel in the airports of the province. In turn, in developed countries such as Japan, despite not being so aggressive or decisive, the incentives came to be widely used in times of crisis such as in the case of COVID -19, the 2008 financial crisis, among others.", "4.3 Olympic Games growing complexity and the necessity for a more sustainable model To talk about Olympic investment, first must be a reflection about how the governance of an Olympics takes place, that is, who they are and how the institutions responsible for defining not only the investment rules, but also other polici es, actions and processes of all phases of the event are structured (Bogason & Musso, 2006). In this sense, the decision over investment of a mega sporting event takes into consideration not only an agent, but an entire network, where the level of control, stability and coordination of the leaders will be decisive for the achievement of objectives and the consequent success of the event (Considine., & Afzal, 2011). However, the author explains once again that due to the complexity and extension of the netwo rk, the most common is to observe a decentralization of power and decision over investments, where most decisions are taken in a participatory manner. Thus, it would be common to observe tensions between different actors in complex situations where there w ill not always be a convergence of interests, especially if we consider local and international entities.", "Due to the increasing complexity of the Games since the 1990s, driven mainly by the professionalization of the sport and the growth in the number of s takeholders, thinking about the governance over investments has made more and more sense (Chappelet & Kübler -Mabbott, 2008). The authors, in order to portray the complexity of this network, mapped the main actors that besides the International Olympic Comm ittee, may have interference in decisions about the event, being they: the local organizing committee, national Olympic committees, governments, sponsors, regulatory agencies, international and national sports federations, the media, athletes and delegatio ns, in addition to spectators. Although the last ones do not have much influence over the event's investments, they end up being capable to prospect great pressure on the main entities responsible for it. Among so many actors, Sorensen (2006) argues that t he only way to achieve a positive articulation would be through the implementation of meta -governance mechanisms where formal procedures have been established, besides the creation of", "goals, quality and control standards, in addition to a strong and partic ipative decision mechanism.", "As a way to guide these decisions, Considine & Afzal (2011) draws attention to the fact that despite the challenges presented by many Olympic projects, the IOC shares some principles to be followed by those responsible for deliv ering the event, being they: transparency (clear rules and communication, in addition to the publication of results), democracy (decisions in a participatory manner), responsibility (clear and well -defined tasks for each of the actors), autonomy (of the ho st city) and social responsibility (ensuring the legacy for the environment and society). As a way to operationalize these guidelines, Parent (2008) highlights the importance of the figure of the local organizing committee, which acts in the coordination o f efforts from the planning phase since the BID, during the event itself, and even some period after the end of the Games, in the intention of demobilizing the structure and deliver the legacy plan.", "Although the organizing committees have had different con figurations through the Games editions, sometimes more independent and sometimes more subordinate to the local government, their mission has become increasingly complex precisely due to the gigantism assumed by the last Olympic editions (Chappelet, 2013), which since its first edition in 1896, it has gone from 14 events, 250 athletes and 14 countries, to 306 events, 11,238 athletes and 206 countries in 2016. A movement that still seems to continue with the inclusion of 5 new sports modalities in the Tokyo G ames, increasing the number of events to 339 (IOC, 2016). For Paris (2024), new modalities have already been announced, reaching a total of 38, a number considerably higher than the 21 practiced in the Games of the 1970s and 1980s. With this, the proportio ns taken by the Olympic Games ended up increasing the network level of complexity and consequent investment cost of the project, going against the of sustainability and social responsibility pillars defended by the Agenda 2020.", "The increasing complexity of the Olympic Games has become a great challenge specially for one of the highest standards defended by the international Olympic Committee during the planning phase, the sustainability of the project. This requirement assumed by the host cities at the time of their candidacy is one of the three pillars that must guide the future of the Olympic movement, and are highlighted in the already mentioned Agenda 2020, as well as in its update, Agenda 2020+5 (IOC, 2021). Despite this speech had emerged in the 1990s amid the increased representation of the sustainable development agenda at the UN, after about 3 decades it is still a topic that divides", "opinions, since in practice it has been difficult to see measures that make the mega sporting events on the planet tru ly sustainable in its broadest sense, which takes into account not only ecological aspects, but also considers social and economic impacts (Vanwynsberghe, 2015).", "Perhaps one of the biggest challenges in achieving the defended sustainable model may lie prec isely in the economic variable that involves the projects. Despite all the difficulty of quantifying tangible, intangible, direct and indirect costs of hosting an Olympics, over the last century it was already possible to observe an increase in expenses (Zarnowski, 1993). According to the author, if at the Athens Games (1986) there was an expenditure per athlete of 17 thousand dollars in regressive values, at the Berlin Games (1936) this amount was already 53 thousand dollars, reaching the mark of USD 1 mil lion in the first Asian Games in Tokyo in 1964. Barcelona itself (1992), considered a general success case, was also the most expensive edition of the 20th century at a cost of USD 7 billion, almost the double of the USD 3,6 billion spent by Atlanta in 199 6 (Brunet, 1995). The escalation of expenditures would only increase in subsequent editions such as in Nagano (1998) USD 15.2 billion, up to USD 45 billion in Beijing (2008), and USD 51 billion in Sochi (2014), which became known as the most expensive Olym pics in history (CFR, 2019). These high values, each time more common in events of this size, may in fact open discussion about the real sustainability of the Olympic projects. While what should be a rule, in practice what can be observed in the last 30 ye ars has been isolated sustainability initiatives such as in the Albertville Games (1992), Salt Lake City (2002) and Vancouver (2010), being this last one, one of the only editions to have completed its Olympic impact study, whose ended up being abandoned y ears later in 2017 due to the cost involved (Müller et al ., 2021). This lack of recent examples capable of proving to other cities around the world that a good Olympic planning can, in fact, materialize the sustainable Games model that has been widely disc ussed in the IOC sphere, has driven away the interest of cities around the world. This becomes clear with the withdrawal of the candidacies of Krakow and Stockholm from the 2022 Winter Games, and Budapest, Hamburg and Rome from the 2024 Summer Games. With only Los Angeles and Paris in dispute, the alternative ended up being to distribute the Games of 2024 and 2028 between the remaining interested parties. Model that followed with Brisbane's sole application for 2032 Olympics.", "Another problem presents in alm ost all Olympic projects, once again having a negative impact on the sustainability of the model, has been the expenditure much higher", "than planned (Flyvbjerg et al. 2016). The authors pointed out that during the 1960s and 2016, there was an average expend iture 156% over budget with a negative contrast for the Olympic Games as a high -risk investment. In this sense, many authors have questioned the real advantages of hosting mega sporting events (Pappa & Brückner, 2015), which in some cases, instead of contributing to the sustainable development of the host cities, ended up generating an increase in public debt and negative economic impacts in the medium term. Although much is sai d about the legacy left by the Olympic Games, between the years 1970 and 2009, it has been common to observe impacts that are more negative than positive, as in the case of Athens in 2004, which left the Games of that year in a deep economic crisis due to the high public spent (Jakobsen et al., 2012). In view of this, is important to reflect about the logic of companies and governments in investing in an Olympic agenda. Past Olympic editions had showed us that despite the economic logic do not make clear th e advantages of hosting the event, the possibilities of long -term intangible legacies may be one of the main motivators that still lead to the search for locations to host mega events in general. In this sense, it is necessary to first conceptualize this t erm which is often used in contexts that involve the Olympics. Cashman (2002) understands the Olympic legacy in a large sense, caring issues beyond economic ones but also affecting urban spaces, environment, education, politics, culture, sport and memory o f the hosting regions. Preuss (2007), on the other hand, goes further by visualizing the legacy in three distinct dimensions which can be planned or unplanned, positive or negative, tangible and intangible. In this logic, the same event can leave positive legacies for some sectors such as the tourism industry and negative for others such as the impacts on the environment.", "Although the legacy is currently an important part of the Olympic bid, the way it is later managed by the organizing committee still can be seen with criticism (Agha et al., 2012). According to the authors, in the years of preparation, the greatest concern seems to be with the delivery of the event and not with the impacts that it can generate in the medium or long term. This is reflected i n the fact that the local organizing committee is usually dissolved within 2 years after the Games while its positive or negative impacts may remain for decades. The Global Olympics Impact Report (OGGI) like the one implemented by Vancouver in 2010 also fo llows that logic. Despite gathering information and generating relevant statistics that serve as base material for future editions, it does not have practical implications for incomplete legacy promises.", "Regarding the assessment of the Olympic legacy from a tangible point of view, this is a topic that has proved to be even more problematic to the winter editions (Könecke & de Nooij, 2017). This has occurred since the structures developed for this type of event are even more difficult to be converted for the benefit of the local population when compared to the Summer Olympic Games. In order to contribute to this panorama, Scheu et al., (2018) pointed out that although the legacy theme has gained more relevance in recent years, the efforts of the cities are st ill very concentrated in the legacies that only contemplate urban transformations as they are visible to the population and provide better justifications for the high expenses involved. In this sense, Li & McCabe (2013) indicate that measurement of the int angible legacies of the Olympic Games becomes even more difficult due to the lack of indicators or studies. Thus, assessing the positive and negative consequences of the mega sporting events have left the image, culture and local memory; becoming a challen ge for the hosting locations.", "Tangible and intangible legacies have been investigated by different researches over the past few years, even so their results have presented limitations precisely because of the difficulty in determining the appropriate time frame - where does the Olympic legacy begin or end? (Preuss, 2015). Despite the legacy being one of the pillars of the Olympic candidacy required by the IOC, after the end of the event, the attention is turned to the next edition leaving the past hosting l ocations to manage it alone (Leopkey & Parent, 2016). Therefore, it is relevant to reflect on the legacy that the investments of the international mega sporting events could bring to the hosting locations, since positive or negative impacts brought by thes e will contribute to the sustainability of the Olympic Games model in the medium and long term.", "4.4 Thesis guiding concepts", "Table 1 – Guiding concepts", "Source: prepared by the Author", "5.

This abductive analysis is recommended in situations where there is a variable of phenomena’s to be studied with the aim of discovering new things, whether variables, flows or theoretical models (Dubois, & Gadde, 2002) . In this sense, the abductive technique can be understood as one of the best ones for generating new theoretical models or even testing existing ones. The creation of the theoretical framework presented in each one of the thesis articles, precisely arises from this logic – with the objective to better explain the phenomena found in the field. Therefore, data analysis was made in a qualitative way, so that we could register facts, analyze, interpret them, and identify their causes. For Yin (2005) the case s tudy is an empirical investigation that look into a contemporary phenomenon within its proper real-life context. This method is widely used when circumstances are complex and can change, when the solutions for those conditions wasn’t found before, when sit uations are highly politicized and where there are many stakeholders.

The visited brands were Accor Hotels, Best Western H otels, Golden Tulip Hotels, Marriott Hotels, Othon Hotels, Venit + Mio Hotel and Windsor Hotels. These chains, which are composed by both local and foreign groups, were chosen because they have, to a lesser or greater extent, expanded their equity investme nts in the city of Rio de Janeiro during the years that preceded the 2016 Olympic games. It is worth mentioning that a good part of these projects was located in the western part of the city, close to the Olympic Park, which was the place responsible for h osting most part of the events and also tourists during the Olympic and Paralympic period. In order to better understand the movements that these hotel chains made in the period, another group of public agencies also received the attention of this research , and it was important to be able to triangulate the information received by the interviewees of the first group. As a result, this research also included the participation of the Brazilian Hotels Association (ABIH), Federation of Industries of the State o f Rio de Janeiro (FIRJAN), Rio 2016 Organizing Committee, Rio Convention & Visitors Beaureau, Rio de Janeiro City Hall, Rio Negócios, and the State Secretariat for Sport, Leisure and Youth.", "Data collection took place through secondary sources from the ana lysis of scientific , journalistic articles and marketing material provided by some of the companies and entities visited , from primary sources through semi -structured interviews with both managers of the local hotel chain as well as people involved in publ ic life and sector entities linked to the tourism and hospitality industry in the city of Rio de Janeiro. The conversations held with the interviewees were transcribed generating 254 pages of primary data that went through a coding process for categorizing their responses. This allowed us to reach a total of 20 variables distributed in 5 different groups: (1) types of costumers, (2) sources of revenue, (3) hotel competitors, (4) traditional challenges, and (5) new challenges.

Study organization", "In addition to this introductory part, the present study is subdivided into three other papers and also a part for final considerations. Right afterwards, paper 1 had the objective of identifying res earch flows that are being discussed within the proposed study area of direct investment and mega events , as well as to verify gaps or research areas to be explored. Furthermore, from this exploratory research, new propositions were created that originates a theoretical framework, whose purpose was to identify constructs on the flow of direct investment in contexts of mega events, as well as the main sectors affected. As the main results of the article, 8 research propositions were presented, divided into 6 different categories classified as destination image, urban transformations, public policies, economic and social development, companies’ internationalization, and national and international tourism.", "The research propositions highlighted that (1) mega ev ents tend to impact, positively or negatively, on the destination image of the hosting region; (2) the growing participation of emerging nations in international mega events results in generating new business opportunities for these regions; (3) mega event s end up having a substantial impact on the international investment flows, with a greater incidence in specific sectors of the economy, such as tourism and hospitality, urban mobility and infrastructure; 4) mega events tend to be catalysts of internationa l pressures, especially for sensitive issues such as public security, political freedom and human rights; (5) the mega events legacy, that if not well monitored, can generate negative impacts and contribute to cases of corruption and economic crises; (6) g reater institutional instability presented in emerging regions contributed to the appearance of public incentive policies, with the objective of balancing the investors attractiveness levels; (7) mega events end up becoming one of the greatest promoters of changes, including long -term structural ones; (8) mega events in many of the cases observed had become a determining factor for the expansion of foreign business.", "Due to the structural transformations observed in the City of Rio de Janeiro during the year s leading up to the 2016 Olympics, and in order to test some of the research proposals found on paper 1 – especially proposition number 3 – in the second paper was made the option to analyze the specificities of the tourism and hospitality segment in the region, that historically has also been one of the sectors mostly affected by mega sporting events around the world. This is justified due to the hospitality sector had presented major changes in the City of Rio de Janeiro during the period analyzed, with h igh levels of investment in the years just after the Olympic nomination, culminating in an explosion in the offer of rooms, with an increasing of 76% in a just 5 years period (Rio Negócios, 2016). However, what was seen right after the end of the 2016 Olym pic Games was a very different situation for the city and the hotel sector itself, which, due to the explosion in the offer and the lack of a post -event planning, ended up plunging into a deep crisis that ended up with the closing of several new hotel vent ures, many of which have just been opened for the Olympics. That way, the case is retracted under the perspective of different hotel brands that expanded their investments in the years leading up to the 2016 Games.", "The lack of a post -event planning observed in the case of Rio de Janeiro, together with several corruption scandals in public construction contracts, ended up being one of the main reasons for the systemic crisis that took over not only the hotel industry of the", "city, but the entire local business environment in the following years. This same problem, also observed in other recent Olympic editions, has made the IOC and other members of the Olympic Family 3rethink, especially from the publication of the 2020 Agenda in 2014, the entire sustainability model responsible for delivery the Games until then. The creation of new sustainability parameters end up becoming even more necessary with the sanitary crisis caused by COVID -19 in the beginning of 2020, that dir ectly impacted not only the Olympics of that year, but an entire event supporting industry that at that point had already investment billions of dollars in new business in the local economy. Thus, COVID has been responsible for putting even more pressure o n the megaevents sustainability agenda. Afterwards, in paper 3 a strategic option was made in order to enable us to observe the impacts of the pandemic on the Tokyo Games, which became known by the first Olympic postponement in all the modern history of t he event. Despite all the difficulties of analyzing a phenomenon at the time is still in progress, whose social and business impacts may still take years to emerge, the focus of the study was not only observe a specific sector of the economy as performed i n the previous article, but to make an analysis under a more macro aspect, in order to understand how the pandemic context impacted not only Tokyo, but will bring transformations and leave trends also for the mega -events of the future, especially with rega rd to the planning of Olympic investments, now even more restrict in a reality of systemic crisis. The paper brought together the perspective of different entities who at the time of the postponement of the Tokyo Olympic Games in March 2020 were directly o r indirectly affected by the decision, these combined perspectives help us identify not only the singularities of Japanese project, but also the difficulties and adaptations that companies and organizers had to make to overcome the pandemic situation.", "Thus, both cases analyzed can be understood here as complementary and not comparative, since together they bring different perspectives of the sustainability of investments in mega sporting events both in terms of emerging and developed countries, which by th eir own characteristics bring different interpretations about the institutional variable perceived by international organizations and companies. Despite different uncertainties, the combined analysis also made it possible to assess how external threats", "3 The Olympic Family are formed by diverse groups of leaders from the Olympic Movement, including the IOC President and IOC Members, International Federations and National Oly mpic Committees Presidents and Secretaries General, Chairs and CEOs of TOP Partners, future OCOG senior executives, RHB senior executives and others.", "such as the political crisis in the case of Rio de Janeiro, and the sanitary issues in the case of Tokyo, affect not only specific sectors of the industry, but make us rethink all the model of Games that had been practiced so far.

We believe that although the Olympic G ames were chosen to represent this study, its results and propositions can be applied to other mega event contexts occurring in either developed or emerging locations. To this purpose, a systematic review of the literature was made based on the combined search of the terms \"Foreign Direct Investment\" and \"Olympic Games,\" which gathered a final sample of 170 publications from 17 of the most relevant databases in the world. It was verified that although few studies have dealt with this issue as a central them e of discussion, they have been gaining relevance mainly since the Beijing Olympics in 2008.

Introduction", "With the advance of globalization, especially since the second half of the twentieth century, there has been an increase in political, social, cultural, and economic interactions between different nations (Lastres, Cassiolato, Lemo s, Maldonado, & Vargas, 1998). But if, on the one hand, this approach of the world economies brings diverse opportunities for expanding international business, it also carries with it several challenges. These challenges are due to the greater number of in teractions in a network of countries and", "institutions that make the market increasingly complex, volatile, dynamic, and susceptible to incentives and constraints of the agents that compose it.", "In this context, one of the factors that has caught the attent ion of firms when choosing to enter an external market or to expand their investments in foreign subsidiaries is the political -institutional aspect (Honório & Rodrigues, 2006). Locations of greater political and regulatory instability, for example, may dic tate the discouragement or failure of large investments. The opposite is also observed, that is, countries can encourage the entry of foreign companies into their domestic market through different tools and strategies that draw attention to the uniqueness of mega events and the interest of city, province, and national governments to host them precisely because of the visibility and investments they can bring. Whether it is an international sporting event such as the Olympic Games or a FIFA World Cup, major music festivals, or even conferences with the presence of world leaders, all are able to bring challenges and opportunities to the locality that hosts them and they will directly impact the image of the destination country (Lee, Taylor, Lee, & Lee, 2005).", "This type of event, which was once exclusive to developed countries, is increasingly present among the emerging regions (Almeida & Júnior, 2014), as in the cases of the Athens Olympics in 2004 and Beijing in 2008, besides the FIFA World Cup 2010 in South A frica, Brazil in 2014, and Russia in 2018. The dynamics of mega sporting events that move in the same direction as international investments were formerly almost exclusively from the developed north to the emerging countries, but now it is possible to observe investments from the south toward the north and also between emerging regions (south -south), giving us a logic that these international flows of foreign direct investment follow at the moment both a vertical and horizontal logic. According to a report by the Institute of International Finance (IIF) (2021), in 2019, the last year before the world has been affected by the COVID -19 Crisis, the inflow of foreign capital into emerging countries was US$1.26 trillion, which represents a significant increase co mpared to the US$970 billion in 2017 or the US$391 billion in 2014.", "Mega events often generate sudden changes in context that if not well managed can create several problems for the economies of the localities that receive them (Oliveira, 2011). Unlike the FIFA World Cup where costs are usually shared between the different host cities – that could be more than 10 in some cases – at the Olympic Games, investments and their consequent risks are concentrated in a single location. This logic, which usually impo ses even greater challenges to the projects, has brought us ambiguous", "examples such as Barcelona (1992) and Athens (2004). If on the one hand Barcelona is treated in literature as the main success case in terms of socio -economic transformation of a host ci ty, on the other hand, Athens announced the final cost of its Olympic project as almost double the initial estimate, besides having lived a pre -Olympic and post - Olympic period of increasing public debt and shrinking GDP according to the Foundation for Econ omic & Industrial Research (2015).", "The Brazilian case (Ribeiro, Soares, & Da Costa, 2014) is marked as the first edition of an Olympiad held in a South American country. Even almost 5 years after the Games, the legacy left by the event is still uncertain. Since 2017 what could be observed in the city was the underutilization of much of the infrastructure built, with a maintenance cost for the empty arenas that already reaches US$16 million (Veja, 2021), along with reports of corruption that have left the co untry, and especially the state of Rio de Janeiro, in a situation of distrust and political instability. But on the other hand, we can also see the positive impact of international events in the national economies, as mentioned by Qu and Or (2006) who anal yzed the flow of tourism incomes from the perspective of the Olympic Games and other macroeconomic mega events.", "According to Ribeiro (2016), studies in the area of international business, though they have increased over the last two decades, are still litt le recurrent if they are longitudinal researches capable of theoretical contributions and for the most part are restricted to authors or group of authors already traditionally known, as we will see in the next chapter. During the collection of the data, it was also identified that there are some localized papers that use this technique and were concentrated in recurring authors dealing in specific areas such as international mergers and acquisitions (Ferreira, Pinto, & Serra, 2014), international transactio n costs (Ferreira, Santos, Almeida, & Reis, 2014), and international culture (Pinto, Serra, & Ferreira, 2014).", "Because of this, most of the paper’s contribution is made by identifying theoretical gaps resulting from the lack of relevant bibliometric studie s in the area especially in what concerns specific contexts such as the mega events that are being analyzed here, but it will also suggest some propositions and a new theoretical framework capable of synthetizing and mapping the main research contributions in the recent years. Therefore, this study aims to carry out a systematic literature review in order to map and analyze the scientific publications of recent years that have combined the mega sporting events with foreign direct investment in different mom ents and realities. The Olympic Games were chosen as a key word due to its historical relevance in the urban transformations of host", "localities when compared to other cultural, political -economic, sectorial or even sporting mega events. Even so, we believe that the propositions presented here can also be applied to other contexts of mega events of great socioeconomic impact.", "The main intention of this study is to guide researches and practitioners in subjects that run through the area that joins the univers e of mega events and foreign direct investment. With this, we believe that the contributions will not only help future researches to develop their studies and the area, but they will also support the decision - making process in companies that are intending to operate or expand their investments in locations that host mega events such as an Olympiad or a rock festival. Thus, in addition to this introductory part, this study is subdivided into a session that deals with the theoretical references followed by th e method, results, discussion, and finally a brief chapter that will deal with the final considerations and recommendations for future researches.", "2. Literature review", "2.1 Foreign market entry modes", "The international business area has two dominant theoretical currents – the economic and the behavioral (Andersen & Buvik, 2002). Although these lines of thought bring different approaches, both are interested in explaining the internationalization process of firms, a phenomenon that has gained strength since the period known as post - World War II when the emergence of the so -called multinational corporation was intensified. With the increase in the presence of multinationals, it was observed that the firm’s internationalization process presented some patterns and could take on different forms ranging from the simplest to the most complex form like developing a new subsidiary abroad. It is important to mention that although there is a logic of a progressive commitment of resources within the entry modes, we cannot assume that this is a linear process since multinational corporations do not necessarily follow this logic. The choice of entry mode mainly affects the level of risk and control of the operation and tends to be defined by the degree of commitment of resources that the company would be willing to spend (Agarwal & Ramaswami, 1992). Entry modes with lower levels of resource commitment, would also involve less control over the operation, while other modes of direct investment would demand a higher level of commitment of resources but also increase the company’s control over the process. Once again, Agarwal and Ramaswami (1992), explain that there is no better or worse entry mode, and all", "options present ad vantages and disadvantages. The choice varies with each company’s strategy, which may be influenced by managers, environment, and company preferences measured by their risk avoidance profile, business opportunities, and previous experience in international markets.", "Nevertheless, the option was to focus on direct investment because it is the form that, despite presenting a higher risk, has at the same time a greater capacity of impact on the local business environment, creating jobs and social development. The mega events context discussed here could then be a catalyst for narrowing the investor perceived distances since, in addition to the greater business opportunity that these contexts often create, the media attention that these locations receive could a lso contribute to greater familiarity with local culture, reducing the psychic distances with tangible and intangible results for the local economy.", "2.2 Determining factors for FDI options", "The Nordic School of International Business has gained a reputatio n in this theme due to the papers written by the University of Uppsala in Sweden since the 1970s. Johanson and Wiedersheim -Paul (1975) and Johanson and Vahlne (1977) described the firm’s internationalization process as something gradual where, as the compa ny acquired experience in the international market, it would be more and more prone to commit a greater number of resources until the moment it decides to opt for entry modes involving foreign direct investment. However, the Uppsala model was criticized fo r its limited ability to explain atypical international movements.", "The level of attractiveness that a business environment presents can be another determining factor to companies when defining their entry mode. A location that is identified with a higher l evel of attractiveness may suggest a higher level of resource commitment while in other less attractive locations companies would tend to avoid great investments due to perceived risks. In this sense, the Olympic Games and mega events in general can be und erstood as an “anomaly” not predicted by the traditional theories since it directly impacts the perceived level of attractiveness of a hosting locality. As a result, over the years, authors have also incorporated into their construct other issues that coul d influence the decision of internationalization, as in the case of Networks pointed out by Johanson and Mattsson (1987). Another important concept introduced by this theoretical current was known as psychic distance in which Nordström and Vahlne (1992) sa id that the greater the distance perceived between the country of origin and the", "recipient in terms of development, level of educational content, language, culture, political system, etc., the greater the uncertainty indexes and the lower the propensity fo r a great commitment of resources. Once more, the environment created by a mega event is a determinant that will guide the network opportunities and the psychic distance in host locations.", "Geurts and Jaffe (1996) point out that the Olympic Games are increa singly viewed as a potential catalyst for urban transformation, increased investment, along with social, economic, and political change. They are expected to bring tourists, foreign investment, and attention to the host locality together with an institutio nal change and global market integration. Because of all those transformations, it is expected that this conjuncture would increase the levels of foreign investment in real estate in the host country as perceived opportunities and reduced levels of (instit utional) risk can attract new investors. Understanding some of the firm internationalization theories as described above is also essential for understanding the dynamics of the flow of international investment since the way in which the company will choose to enter into foreign markets is influenced by the factors defended by authors of both economic and behavioral schools. According to Garrido, Larentis, and Rossi (2006), modes of entry of lesser or greater commitment of resources also defines the volume o f investment that the company carries out in its subsidiaries and with the international flow of investment between countries. At this point, it is important to cite that although several media reports speak about the business opportunities created by the mega events, specifically with the Olympic Games, to the best of our knowledge, no longitudinal scientific study were found proving the real impact of a mega event on foreign direct investment in its receiving localities.", "2.3 Foreign investment and mega e vents", "Despite the lack of longitudinal studies, we have some numbers that indicate the conjunctural changes that hosting a mega event can bring, such as in the case of Brazil, which in the end of 2009 won the right to host the 2016 Olympic Games and in the following year (2010), after a period of successive falls, showed a 17.9% increase in the direct investment flow, jumping from USD 491 billion to USD 575 billion until it peaked in 2014, the period when it hosted the FIFA World Cup, with USD 657 billion a ccording to (OECD, 2014). In percentage terms, even a little smaller, similar phenomenon happened with Japan elected in 2013 with a direct investment growth of 4.9% and London elected in 2005 with a growth of 5.1% over the previous year. While it is diffic ult to", "appoint the actual share of the bid contribution to these numbers, they show us that the years following the choice resulted in an increasing level of direct investment to these locations. Another similarity is the fall in investment levels about 5 or 6 years after the election, which is the period when most of the infrastructure responsible to meet the demand generated by the events would be completed or nearing completion. Furthermore, we had in the past few years a great presence of mega events t aking place in emerging countries, which include Brazil (2016), South Africa (2010), China (2008), and Greece (2004). Because of this, it is also important for us to understand the institutional theory since it shows an important alternative for analyzing and understanding foreign direct investment decisions of multinationals, especially those flows that go in & out of emerging economies. Over the next years, Dunning (2003) showed a concern with improving his model with the incorporation of other variables not contemplated in his seminal papers, such as networks, and more recently in a coauthored paper (Dunning & Lundan, 2008) entitled \"Institutions and the OLI paradigm of the multinational enterprise\" where they revisit their theoretical model from the incl usion of the institutional dimension of the research of North (1990). This institutional approach has become essential to understand the multinational company in the contemporary world, which now gains more and more relevance in other places such as on the Asian continent mainly due to the presence of countries such as India and China. This historical adaptation of the eclectic paradigm continues until the year 2010 when Cantwell, Dunning, and Lundan published a paper that dealt with the evolutionary and in terrelation aspects of the activities of multinationals with the public policies, a research that also incorporated aspects of change in the institutional, technological, and business environment.", "The growth in the number of multinational corporations, especially since the second half of the twentieth century, has increased the flow of financial capital among the different nations, and if before we could only observe the international presence of large corporations, today there is the presence of small and medium -sized enterprises, many of which are already internationalized – the so -called born global (Knight & Cavusgil, 2004).", "This new type of business, while challenging the logic proposed by the more traditional theories of firm internationalization, is increasingly relevant in a global investment logic since these enterprises together represent significant portions of international business. Also, a lot of temporary companies are created just to attend a", "specific demand that a mega event can generate, and even being dissolved latter, these companies also contribute to the local economy with jobs and direct investments sometimes. As a result, these group of companies could not be left out from bein g mentioned here since they are also present in specific contexts of mega events either autonomously or in partnership, providing services to larger networks, thus contributing to the viability of the event and the foreign direct investment flows.", "3. Meth od", "The present literature review was done in a systematic way so that the results obtained here can be recreated by other researchers who wish to replicate or advance in the studies of the field, as has been done by other researches in this area (Apriliya nti & Alon, 2017) and (Van Eck & Waltman, 2014).", "A search was done for scientific articles that contained the terms \"Foreign Direct Investment\" and \"Olympic Games.\" The survey generated a result of 531 publications. For this search, 17 different databases presented significant results: \"Advanced Technologies & Aerospace Database,\" \"Civil Engineering Abstracts,\" \"Elsevier,\" \"Emerald,\" \"GALE,\" \"JSTOR,\" \"Materials Business File,\" \"Materials Research Database,\" \"Materials Science & Engineering Database,\" \"ProQ uest,\" \"SAGE,\" \"Scopus,\" \"Sociological Abstracts,\" \"Springer\" \"Technology Research Database,\" and \"Web of Science\" .", "Of the 531 publications found, only the 231 that presented peer review were considered.

After reading the abstracts, 61 papers w ere discarded because they considered other areas of study different from international business, which is the focus of this paper. The remaining 170 publications were divided into two groups. The first group considered the papers that dealt with the theme of interest in a transversal way, while the others covered the issue of foreign direct investment and Olympic games as a more central issue of the discussion.", "All the 170 papers had a complete English -language version and together they represented 2,817 pages of research carried out between 1993 and 2018. The material was then submitted to a content analysis within the software of statistical treatment “R” in order to observe the behavior of publications over the last few years, their most frequent", "terms, and associations (R Core Team, 2015). The articles identified as having a greater relevance also passed through a qualitative analysis with the objective of identifying how the discussions in the area have behaved in order to create new theoretical propos itions and a framework capable of mapping the main subjects discussed and guide academics and practitioners in the area in their future work.", "With this division of the final sample of 170 articles into two groups, it was possible to do different types of data analysis and treatment for each of them, thus enabling the use of both quantitative and qualitative techniques in this systematic literature review. Quantitatively, the bibliometric tool R Studio was chosen for being a robust software of statistical a nalysis that assists literature reviews and other quantitative work. From the input of a database generated by the researcher, R Studio is able to generate several types of outputs such as frequent word counts, word associations, and their interconnections , thus producing a deeper and more reliable content analysis map in comparison with other conventional literature reviews.", "As a result, the first group gathered 126 articles identified as being of lesser relevance because they presented a more transversal discussion on the topic of foreign direct investment and Olympic Games in their research, while the remaining 46 were selected as having the greatest impact and contribution to this area of study. Thus, the first group underwent a quantitative analysis of the data described above, whereas the second group was submitted to both the quantitative technique of content analysis in R and to a qualitative discussion, which categorized the papers according to the region and central theme of research that it addres sed.", "With this we were able to organize the papers into three different groups called research workflows. The first group of papers is concerned with themes that explain the event and their relation with the foreign environment, while the second group tal ks about the influence that the event causes on the domestic environment, and the third discusses their impacts on the destination’s image. This separation was important to prepare the terrain for the final stage of this study, helping us to suggest new re search propositions and a theoretical framework, as can be observed in the following sessions.", "4. Bibliometric analysis Figure 1 shows the disposition of the 170 articles throughout their publication years. We can observe that the first publication date i s from 1993, just after the Barcelona Olympics in 1992, an edition of the games that was marked as the main success case in", "terms of socioeconomic transformation of a host city that used the games as a strategy for implementing large projects, urban interv entions, and regional economic development with the attraction of investments to the Catalonia region. We can also note that publications in the area behave cyclically, just as Olympic Games, and tend to decrease or increase as an Olympic year distances or approaches.", "Figure 1 – Number of articles per year", "Source: prepared by the author", "It is also interesting to note that despite the cyclical pattern, the number of publications has shown a growth trend since the beginning of the historical series in 1993. The biggest increase was mainly in the vicinity of the 2008 Olympics in China, an emerging country that gains each time more relevance in the international scenario due to its territorial, population, economic, political, and also sporting characteristics. In (Figure 2) we measured the most frequent terms found in the 170 papers analyzed, of which we can highlight \"China\" as the one with the highest incidence, much because they are one of the largest global players in the foreign investment theme. There has been a growing number of papers coming from Chinese authors and universities mainly since 2008 when they hosted their first Olympiad. Other terms also of great importance that close the top 5 are \"development,\" \"countries,\" \"cities,\" and \"market.\" Other frequent terms that could be highlighted were \"economy,\" \"industry,\" \"global,\" \"gover nment,\" and \"international\".", "Figure 2 – Frequent terms", "Source: prepared by the author", "When taking a look at the chart, we once again saw the importance of China now represented by the term \"Chinese.\" Soon afterwards we were able to visualize the terms used in our paper, \"foreign\" and \"investment,\" which unlike other systematic reviews of literature, did not appear as the most cited term, but still remain with a high degree of importance within the theme. Next came \"production\" and \"regional.\" It is interesting to observe the terms \"technology\" and \"firm\" since it is the first time that the individual figure o f the corporate entity appears. Lower down on the graph we find the incidence of terms that pervade growth or development issues. The word \"hotel\" also appears in the background in other graphs, giving us an interesting indication of the importance of tourism and the hospitality sector, which is one of the sectors most affected by this type of event. Although we want to present the most frequent terminologies that appear, these other issues will be clearer and better discussed in the next chapter where an a nalysis of the data is carried out.", "As for the journals responsible for these publications, what is observed is a very large heterogeneity without a dominant line standing out from the others, and proof of", "this was the presence of 161 different magazines among the 231 publications that were reviewed in the initial analysis. However, if we could highlight some topics they would be sports magazines such as \"International Journal of Sports Marketing & Sponsorship\" and \"Sport, Business and Management\" as well as hospitality and tourism with the presence of the \"International Journal of Hospitality Management\" and \"Tourism and Hospitality Research,\" urban transformations and economic development marked by the presence of “Cities,” “Urban Studies,” “World Develop ment,” and “Intereconomics.” It is also important to highlight the large number of Asian journals such as \"Asian Perspective\" and \"The China Quarterly.\" Finally, a dendrogram of words, which is a specific type of diagram that organizes certain factors and variables, was performed in Figure 3. This graph was the result of a statistical analysis of the articles selected and consists of a quantitative method that leads to groupings in their ascending hierarchical ordering, so it illustrates the arrangement of groupings of the most frequent terms derived from applying a clustering algorithm.", "Figure 3 – Word dendrogram", "Source: prepared by the author", "By analyzing from the largest to the smallest branch, we can see the topic of \"development\" tied to \"market\" in one of the clusters, parallel to \"country\" in a macro branching that gives rise to other questions that will appear on the far right of the diagram such as \"government\" issues related to \"economic\" and also \"political\" issues. Below we", "identify the appe arance of the term \"international\" associated with issues of \"productivity,\" \"investment,\" and \"foreign.\" Following the dendrogram we see the \"global\" them related to \"public\" \"national\" policies, as well as the \"effects\" that \"Olympic\" games bring. Finall y, there are still associations of terms such as the \"increase\" of the \"universal\" \"level\" of \"imports\" that we can be understood as the impact that the flow of investments has on the trade balance of the world regions.", "It is worth emphasizing that the dendrogram and the content analysis technique in general requires an effort to remove words that are not relevant to the discussion, as well as to perform the cutting of word density as precisely as possible so as not to pollute the graph with terms that d o not contribute to the discussion. This process is a path of comings and goings that is limited to the perception and biases of the researcher as to when to stop. This way the main issues involving researches that deal with foreign direct investment, the Olympic Games, and their associations can be observed in general terms. A qualitative analysis of the most relevant articles found is still necessary in order to understand precisely some other unexplored theoretical themes and perspectives so that a more complete mapping of the area can be generated and with that direct future studies capable of providing mostly theoretical and empirical contributions.", "5. Researches, propositions & framework", "The group of articles that we consider to be more closely relat ed to the transformations that cities, regions, and sectors of the economy undergo from the influence of mega events such as the Olympic Games at a quantitative level are 46 research papers published between the years of 1996 and 2016 in 36 international journals that were selected after reading the summaries of the 170 articles found from the search filters. Although the title or area of publication of some selected articles does not directly contemplate the main terms of the paper, these end up appearin g through the text discussion, contributing to the mapping of the legacies and challenges that will be further presented in the framework section. The summaries of the most relevant papers appear in the appendix of this paper, which classifies the research streams and identifies the main themes where the discussion takes place.", "The information highlighted in the table was proposed by the author who identified that although many of the papers bring a regional discussion, some countries deserve attention in the discussion, mainly South Africa, Brazil, England, Greece, New Zealand, and China. On the other hand, there is a movement by some of the researches to", "use samples of global representativity, but these cases are still little explored when compared to the others.", "After reading the papers, we realized that although they dialogue with different topics such as urban transformations, public policies, economic & social development, tourism, and internationalization of companies, in fact the discussions were di vided into three major research flows: (1) the event and its foreign impact with the attraction of FDI and the increase of local competitiveness, (2) the event and its domestic impact with the increase of the construction driven by local public policies, and (3) the impacts that the transformations caused by the event have on the destination’s image, as we can see below.", "5.1 The event and its foreign impact", "Some of the selected papers dealt with the question of internationalization of companies and expan sion of FDI, as in the case of Soderman and Dolles (2008) who published a study about the Chinese case where they identified the factors that led to the attraction of new companies from the moment the country was chosen to host the 2008 Olympic Games. On t he occasion, they found that despite the high risks involved, many international brands saw the event as an opportunity to enter the Chinese market, considered by brand managers to be of high potential and at that time were more suitable to consume easter n culture and brands.", "From this perspective, Guillet, Zhang, and Gao (2011) attempt to decipher the investment logic of the international hotel industry in China and the impact that mega events bring to tourism and the hospitality sector in general. They verified that the presence of large events affects the attractiveness of the domestic market due to adjustments in government policies that please the business community and are more favorable at this juncture. These authors continued their study in 2012, but this time with a quantitative approach to find the determinants of investment in the multinational hotel chain, which grew exponentially in China during the period leading up to the games. At the time, Zhang, Guillet, and Gao (2012) verified that many of the government incentives ended up being punctual, and were not renewed after the Olympic period. Even so, it contributed to the entry and establishment of foreign companies in the local market. Falk (2016) was another author that published a quantitat ive study that measured foreign investment in the hospitality industry and found that host locations for mega events were given greater incentives and were more easily developed in these sectors. Furthermore, the hotel companies are once again present in t he research of Andreu,", "Claver, and Quer (2017) who revisit the determinants for the internationalization of hotel networks and verified that the mode of entry is related to the size of the hotel network, its international experience, and number of assets a vailable.", "We were also able to identify some Greek authors who studied foreign direct investment with the internationalization of companies in the context of the Olympic Games. This was the case of Bitzenis, Tsitouras, and Vlachos (2009) who made a histor ical survey between 1995 and 2003 to identify the behavior of the investment flow since the election of Athens as the host of the 2004 Olympics, and they verified that even with the presence of the Games, Greece was not able to advance with some structural problems that cause uncertainty in investors such as bureaucracy, taxation, and corruption.", "That same year Anastassopoulos, Filippaios, and Phillips (2009) studied the profitability of foreign multinational companies and local firms in the hotel sector t hat had their investments expanded to mainly meet the demand generated by the Athens Olympics. The authors found that the companies that performed best in the period were those that allied themselves with local partners and made use of their market knowled ge. Some other papers more directly address the issue of how mega events affect the development of the tourism sector, whether local or international. In this sense, Zhou - Grundy and Turner (2014) created an indicator to measure the flow of tourists and analyzed the development of the tourism industry as a whole, mainly from the 2008 games. The authors identified that the Asian Olympiad contributed not only to increase the flow of people coming to China, but also to the entire Asian region during the period , which is something similar to that observed in the case of Oceania with Sidney in 2000. Also in the 2000s, Gnoth and Aziz (2002) published another case study concerned with understanding the impact of mega event tourism on the New Zealand economy, mainl y driven by the Sydney Olympics that year. The authors identified that despite the Games occurring in another country, they were able to bring visibility to the region as a whole and contributed to the development of tourism and sports in the Oceania regio n as a whole. In a similar perspective, Khodr (2012) studies the case of the Middle East, more precisely Qatar, after hosting the Asian Games of 2006 and winning the bid for the FIFA World Cup of 2022. One of the author’s main contributions was to identify big events as a business opportunity, and the necessity of the country to obtain experience in mid -scale events in order to gain know -how to host more representative ones, such as in the case of Brazil with the Pan -American Games 2007, World Cup 2014, and Olympic Games 2016.", "We also identify the work of Chorianopoulos, Tsilimigkas, Koukoulas, and Balatsos (2014) who published another horizontal survey that analyzed the spatial transformations of the city and the hotel chain in Athens with a landmark befor e and after the 2004 Olympics. The authors verified that despite the Greece crisis period, the decision to host the Olympics was decisive for the escalation of the country’s tourism and hospitality industry and regional competitiveness mainly within the Eu ropean Union. What these papers have in common is precisely how the context brought by hosting a big event, in this case the Olympic Games, can have a great impact on foreign issues such as the flow of foreign direct investment, attraction of new business opportunities, and the development of specific sectors of the economy. As example, we have the tourism and hospitality industry that in those periods tended to observe a considerable increase in demand, but also a greater competitive pressure due to the presence of new brands and options of stay, for example.", "5.2 The event and its domestic impact", "Another group of authors is concerned with identifying how the context of mega events can affect and accelerate structural changes in public policies in the host countries. Here Cochrane, Peck, and Tickell (1996) studied the case of the Olympic bid for the city of Manchester in England and its impact on local public development policies that at the time suffered several changes in order to be in line with what was being used at the time by the international economic order.", "Song, Gartner, and Tasci (2012) were others who observed the impacts of the Beijing Olympic Games on Chinese migration policy, which historically adopted a restrictive stance on visas, but what w as observed from that moment on was a relaxation and greater receptivity to foreign tourists. Obviously, however, the opening of borders and the large influx of foreign tourists at these events are also a major challenge for public health managers in view of the increased possibility of disease and epidemics. In the same sense, Budabin (2009) politicized the issue by analyzing the international political pressures that China suffered during the Olympic Games because of its stance against the armed conflict that involved the creation of South Sudan. At the time, the Games were used as another channel of pressure from the international society. Also in this context of political pressure, in 2014 Van Detta studied the case of the Winter Olympics in Sochi in Rus sia and the changes in organizational policies of local companies on issues historically sensitive to Russian society, such as gender issues involving the", "LGBT community. The author identified that in this period several campaigns for greater social respon sibility were sponsored by the government and local companies, causing a change of speech compared with previous moments without the presence of international events.", "One of the subjects that is always present in papers that speak of mega international events such as the Olympic Games is the urban transformations that they bring to the hosting locations. In this sense, Pratt (2010) analyses the British case from the point of view of the urban transformations promoted by London by adopting a creative city policy responsible for articulating the transformations in the areas of governance, culture, economy, and urbanization.", "The research of Xu, Ceder, Gao, and Guan (2010) deals with a similar discussion of urban transformations and mega events, but this tim e observing the case of Chinese urban transport, which underwent a great transformation from the period analyzed by the authors from 1945 until the Olympic Games in Beijing in 2008. The authors concluded in their study that these transformations were based on humanistic, technological, and green values, all of which were widely disseminated and accepted by the international community who had their eyes on the country at that moment.", "In sequence, Qin and Han (2013) studied the structural changes and variati on of real estate values in Beijing from the time of their Olympic election. They identified an increase in the value of housing in a more pronounced way compared to other urban centers in the world in the same period, leading us to believe that events of this size tend to develop not only the region that receives it, but also to affect inflationary indices and create housing bubbles.", "In 2017, Li et al. published another paper talking about the transformations of Chinese space influenced by the investments in infrastructure of the Beijing Olympics in 2008. The author puts this event as a determinant watershed that put China at the center of the international globalization process. That same year, Zhang et al. spoke about the drastic transformation of the Ch inese airports responsible for receiving delegations and international tourists, a phenomenon also identified in the Rio de Janeiro Olympics and historically in other locations.", "Another paper that we can mention is from Long, Chen, and Park (2018) who analyzed the improvement of efficiency not only of Beijing, but also of 258 other locations indirectly affected by the 2008 Olympic Games. The paper talks about the", "improvements that the Olympiad brought to the environmental efficiency of the Chinese cities a nd observed that the gains were higher in regions that were closer to Beijing. Another important group identified was those that deal with the impacts that the Olympic Games bring on the economic and social development of the hosting regions. The report p ublished by Brazil Mining (2011) states the fact that the reason Brazil was chosen as the seat for the 2014 FIFA World Cup and for the 2016 Olympic Games is due to its gain in international representation due to its condition of emergent and gaining scale in several sectors of industry. This assertion gives us the idea that the motivation of the candidacies and choices for large events demands a number of political, social, and economic development stages, as well the capacity to attract foreign capital and develop the sites affected.", "In 2017 Fan et al. made a comparative study between Barcelona and Shanghai and their urban development after having studied around the world for their economic development and international integration. The authors highlighted some similarities and differences between both cities, which currently carry a global city status. They said that although they went through a major process of urbanization of economic development mainly from the 1980s onwards, this process in the case of Barcelona was accelerated mainly from the 1992 Olympic Games.", "On the other hand, Fourie and Santana -Gallego (2011) made a critical analysis of the real benefit of receiving a big event considering the infrastructure costs that involved preparing the loca lity. According to the authors, in many cases the amount moved by tourism and business is not enough to cover the investment by the host sites, and the benefits are greater not for the host city, for example, but for their environments. One year later, in 2012, Billings and Holladay conducted a longitudinal study comparing the Olympic finalist candidates in the elections in order to verify the real gains for the economic development of a host city in order to distract from the great flow of people and capit al that the event moves considering the already mentioned high expenses with infrastructure that are necessary and must be considered. Once more they concluded that the tangible gains of hosting the games does not pay for the investment and transformation s that the localities have to do to attend the International Olympic Committee requirements.", "Once again, these papers have in common the way they deal with the transformations that the Olympic Games bring to the hosting location, but this time the logics g o from the foreign to the domestic with the attention to the transformations on the", "urban environment and more flexible public policies. What these studies show us is that while there are pros and cons, good and bad legacies during mega events cycles, coun tries become more prone to change due to the raise of incomes in the public budget and the different pressures from the media and other international actors.", "Although many of these initiatives could be punctual or discontinued after the mega event period ends, they can be responsible for driving long -term transformations on the investment flows, boosting the city infrastructure such as the public transportation and the service sectors. Examples like this could be observed at the Olympic Games of Rio de Jan eiro in 2016, with the publication of several temporary laws that gave tax incentives to key sectors of the economy responsible for supporting the Games, such as tourism, hospitality and infrastructure (Weiss & Jeffrey, 2013). Sochi (2014), was another to use incentive policies to promote the domestic tourism, stimulated that year by the Winter Games (Gudkov, Dedkova, & Dudina, 2017). A similar situation was also experienced by Beijing in 2008, where at the time several tax exemptions were available for bus inesses involved in the preparation of the Olympics (Liu, Zhao, & Wang, 2010). These policies, very present in the most recent editions of mega sporting events, creates a pattern especially observed in emerging locations.", "5.3 The event and its destination image impact", "The impacts, both positive and negative, that mega events can have on the hosting locations are once again highlighted within the group of selected articles, as in the case of Mendes and Figueira (2017) who published a research that investig ates the efforts of the city of Rio de Janeiro to promote international integration policies after the results of the 2016 Olympic Games candidature in order to elevate the city image to the category of other successful Olympic cities. In this same year, M ariutti et al. studied the country of origin effect when they verified the construction of the image of Brazil over the last two decades. The authors identified the question of the mega events that Brazil received mainly between the years 2007 and 2016 as one of the main determinants for improving the perception of the country of origin factor in relation to tourists and foreign consumers. Another research by Zeugner -Roth and Žabkar (2015) also found the perception of the image of the country of origin, an d identified that mega international events are capable of reducing the perceived psychic distance between the country of origin and destination on account of the greater flow of foreigners, contact with local products, and the presence of foreign companie s at the receiving locations. Two years before, White", "and Absher (2013) published a research that studied the influence that mega international sporting events have on the country’s image, as well as the association of the figure of great sportsmen with th eir nationality, and the impact on the perceptions of the products from that country in the eyes of the foreign consumer. One of their findings were that the country image determines several consumption habits and important personality behaviors can influe nce the perception of the country’s image.", "Soon afterwards Chung and Woo (2011) went back to how the 2008 Olympics were able to impact the image of Chinese products with foreign consumers. The authors concluded that hosting the Olympics significantly impr oved China’s image, but it did not affect the image of its products in a positive way. In 2017, Lee, Oh, and Hsu analyzed the impact of mega events and the country -of-origin effect on the perception of foreign tourists for Chinese hotel chains scattered ar ound the world, which improved the customer perception since the Beijing Olympics in 2008.", "Along this line we also found the research of Osei and Gbadamosi (2011) who studied how the reconstruction of the African continent’s image can influence the attrac tion of foreign direct investment to the region as a whole. In their research, the authors cite the big events, such as the FIFA World Cup 2010 in South Africa, as one of the capacitors for transforming the regional image. We also had a study by Lawn and Beatty (2005) who wanted to verify the influence of the film industry in Oceania driven by Sidney 2000, the region’s image improvement, and its positive impact on attracting foreign direct investments to the locality.", "Finally, this third research workflow separates the papers that discuss how mega events affect the image of the host country. It is important to say that the result of the other two workflows has a strong influence on this third since the destination image is something perceived by the communi ty or group of people and is influenced by both the domestic and foreign transformations that the hosting locality promotes during the cycles. Just as there is the positive and negative legacy, the impact that a mega event has on the destination image foll ows the same logic. These are moments where structural problems such as security, poverty, or political and gender freedom can be more exposed or preeminent.", "5.4 Proposing a new theoretical framework We have seen with these researches that various subjects can appropriate the context of mega events to propose not only scientific studies, but also help practitioners", "in conducting their business through the challenge that an environment receiving a mega event can present. Among the secto rs that deserve mention should be hospitality, tourism, infrastructure, and transportation. Issues involving public health, migration, and corruption also appear amidst the discussions. With this, we can see that specific contexts such as the Olympic Games can be catalysts for the diffusion of several other themes due to all the business opportunities and economic development that they usually bring. Because of this, studying the behavior of the market in the midst of such a specific situation becomes essen tial both for the scientific community and for the corporate world since this dynamic occurs cyclically over time with the tendency of a greater participation of emergent regions.", "Table 1 – Theoretical propositions", "Source: prepared by the author Area Propositions Authors Destination Image (1) Mega events tend to have an impact on the image of the region or country that receives them.

As with any corporate movement that involves an investment, a business plan is still recommended so that you can analy ze the real opportunities that this particular context may bring. Although the propositions brought by this paper may help in the decision making of executives passing through this context, it is still unclear the positive or negative relationship that a m ega event may bring on different businesses precisely due to the lack of a larger number of systematic studies concerned with this cyclic and recurrent phenomenon.", "The papers described above, which appropriate mostly empirical methods, show us that a long journey still needs to be made in the way of exploring the potentialities that mega events can bring to the world of business as they address in several cases the implications that the context brings to particular sectors. On the other hand, there still exists a lack of a more comprehensive theoretical discussion showing us how large advances still need to be made in the discussions if we want to seize every opportunity that the conjuncture can offer for optimizing the domestic and international business. Therefore, we suggest some theoretical propositions (Table 1) that are also exemplified through a framework based on the findings from the papers selected that can serve as a guideline for future empirical studies that will follow from here.", "The theoretica l framework proposed must be interpreted from the inside out where in the center we can observe the different kinds of direct investments that are mostly common to the context of mega events that we see here, which are as follows: the public investment mad e by the host country, the local private investment of domestic companies, and the foreign private investment coming from corporations with headquarters in other countries. In the model proposed, this flow of direct investment would be driven by the presen ce of large events of different natures ranging from mega sporting events such as the Olympic games to cultural events such as music festivals, international political meetings, and even industry gatherings such as medical conventions. All these events, despite their different natures, frequency, and proportions, have the ability to promote regions and leave legacies, whether positive or negative.", "This legacy can be seen in the right -hand column of the model. The most commonly observed areas are the impact s on the destination’s image, local urban transformations including urban mobility, public policy, economic & social development, internationalization of new companies or the expansion of existing businesses, and the", "promotion of national and international tourism. Although these are the areas where we could observe a greater presence in the papers analyzed, the issue of legacy is usually linked to the question of the challenges that such contexts of mega events could present, which are represented in the l eft column of the model.", "Figure 4 – The direct investment flows in big events context (Challenges & Opportunities)", "Source: prepared by the author", "A space was also reserved for emerging and developed countries as this was a discussion present in most o f the papers analyzed since in recent years this first group has been gaining more representativeness in the mega events subject. The logic about this division is that, even the mega events are happening in both localities, so the country’s level of develo pment tends to determine how the region will be able to absorb the biggest challenges and catalyzed them in the form of positive legacies. This is something that in the case of emerging countries, a difficulty was observed in bringing positive legacies to the receiving localities.", "The main challenges faced by the host country due to the visibility that those contexts cause are the perceptions and importance that the media usually give to the region in the period, which can be positive or negative. In this sense, a space for the research workflow was also reserved in the model since the foreign, domestic, and destination image impact are always affected by the phenomenon analyzed.

Final considerations", "Understanding the dynamics of the international flow of capital in the increasingly globalized and dynamic world we live is essential for managers and corporations that wish to operate internationally. With the increase in the relevance of the so -called emergent localities, it has been increasingly common to migrate direct investment flows to these regions that although are often able to present good economic indicators, according to others still suffer from issues of political discredit and institutional f ragility. The increase in the representation of areas considered emergent, mainly due to this new class of countries such as China, India, Brazil, Russia, and South Africa, has also made it possible to increase the attraction of mega sporting events and cu ltural or scientific development to these regions. This movement occurs even in the quantity of articles found by this research of literature in which the presence of cases located in emerging regions of the globe such as South America, Africa, the Middle East, and Asia in particular was observed.", "Thus, the objective of this paper was to carry out a systematic review of the literature through searching the terms \"Foreign Direct Investment\" and \"Olympic Games\" in 17 of the main world databases, showing that the scientific publications dealing with the issue of foreign direct investment in Olympic games contexts, especially in emerging countries, have been much better. As a result, we have been able to verify that despite the growth boosted by the 2008 Beijing Olympics and all the literature that has been generated, there are still few researches concerned with discussing foreign investment, a subject already widely explored by the international business literature, in the midst of such a specific context as th e mega events.", "Some of the difficulties found were that many of the studies dealt with the issue of mega events perpendicular to the central themes of the research, and when quoted they ended up being used only to give small explanations, and for that rea son the need to divide the papers into two groups. Nevertheless, it was possible to arrive at some unpublished", "findings, such as the cyclical behavior of the publications with periods of peaks and valleys depending on proximity or distance from the Olympic year, the escalation of the representativeness of regions considered as emerging on the theme, which since the 2000s have been alternating with the developed countries as host cities for the Olympic Games, and the main challenges that the host regions fac e when receiving an event of this size and complexity. The theoretical framework proposed also brings several results expressed in the part of “legacy” where each of them, if analyzed separately, would be able to generate an entirely new theoretical and/or empirical research.", "Another contribution of the paper is also in the creation of 8 theoretical propositions, divided between the 6 areas of legacy of the framework. In the first of them, the article infers that (1) mega events tend to impact, positively or negatively, on the destination image of the hosting region; for the area of economic and social development, it was observed that (2) the growing participation of emerging nations in international mega events results in generating new business opportuni ties for these regions; in turn, it was also found that (3) mega events end up having a substantial impact on the international investment flows, with a greater incidence in specific sectors of the economy, such as tourism and hospitality, urban mobility a nd infrastructure. In addition, for the area of public policies, it was found that (4) mega events tend to be catalysts of international pressures, especially for sensitive issues such as public security, political freedom and human rights.", "Continuing this discussion and perpendicularly affecting the area of destination image and public policy, there are also two other propositions, the first of which brings attention for (5) the mega events legacy, that if not well monitored, can generate negative impacts and contribute to cases of corruption and economic crises. In addition, it was also observed that the (6) greater institutional instability presented in emerging regions contributed to the appearance of public incentive policies, with the objective of bala ncing the investors attractiveness levels. In the area of urban transformations, it was also seen that (7) mega events end up becoming one of the greatest promoters of changes, including long-term structural ones. Finally, there is still the question of co mpanies’ internationalization, since (8) mega events in many of the cases observed had become a determining factor for the expansion of foreign business.", "With this, we hope to encourage other researchers interested in the area to developed studies that de al with the questions related to the destination image, urban transformation, public policies, economic & social development, company", "internationalization and tourism. In times of COVID -19, discuss about some of the themes presented in the challenges and l egacies tab of the suggested framework is even more relevant, since the pandemic situation has affected not only the way of planning and delivery the Olympics, but also directly impacts the international investments standards. In this sense, investigations that can elucidate issues that pervade, for example, the future of mega event tourism become even more relevant at this moment. As a way to contribute to this context, some dilemmas pushed by the pandemic as the restriction to the international flow of pe ople, and its impact on public health and the political environment becomes even more relevant in the context of crisis which the world is going through. Many of these dilemmas have been faced by the organization of the Tokyo Olympic Games, which in 2020 took the decision that culminate in the first Olympic postponement in the history of the modern Games. This choice also directly impacted the local business environment, which in preparation for the event had planned to invest around US$96 billion in secto rs like tourism, communications, and infrastructure (Cord, 2018). All the uncertainty left by the pandemic in the world forced the organizers to adopt a series of adaptations in the original Games model, and those changes that include the lack of internati onal spectators certainly brings great consequences for the international investment flows. Although the results of this crisis could still take years to be understood, they reinforce the need for attention to the series of external environmental threats highlighted in the framework.", "Furthermore, this systematic literature review combined quantitative and qualitative analysis methods that also presented what has been produced on the subject area in recent years in a way that allows gaps to be identified, t hus directing future research both in the area of international business and in the other areas that use specific contexts such as the one proposed here. As far as practical contributions are concerned, company managers will be able to observe in the cases exemplified here the behavior of companies that have experienced mega events, thus formulating better strategies for the Olympic cycles that will follow in order to optimize resources and generate value for their corporations. Other propositions of empiri cal studies are also suggested below and divided by the research propositions that were found.", "In the workflow of the Event and its Foreign Impact, it would be interesting to see studies concerned with understanding “how the flow of foreign direct investm ent into the cities that host mega events has behaved over the years?” or “how did the process of internationalization of foreign companies to regions that received mega events behave", "over recent years?” for example. On the research workflow that deals wit h the Event and its Domestic Impact, it would also be interesting to see answers to questions such as “how did the process of urban transformation of the last Olympic cities take place?” or “which business sectors were most affected by the presence of mega events?” Nevertheless, on the subject of the Event and its Destination Image Impact, valuable contributions could come on understanding “how did foreign tourists perceive a specific destination image before and after the hosting of a mega event?” and “how did the flow of domestic and foreign tourism behave before, during, and after a mega event?” Furthermore, this paper was limited to a bibliographical analysis on the subject with cuts susceptible to the biases of the researcher. It is strongly encouraged that similar studies involving other related search topics be replicated, as well as the qualitative analysis of a larger number of articles. It is also suggested to use empirical research data such as case studies capable to assess the behavior of multin ational companies in emerging and large -scale locations as this is still an area little explored and offers great possibilities of research for those interested in the subject and intend to contribute to the international business area.", "7.

To this end, a qualitative case study research was carried out that included 7 different hotel brands whose results were coded and categorized resulting in a theoretical -conceptual framework responsible for identifying some competitive pressures on traditional hospitality including 6 different challenges: (1) political institutional insecurity, (2) perceptions of the media, (3) public security, (4) other national and foreign locations, (5) new videoconference technologies, and (6) Online Travel Agencies. It was found that the exponential growth in the number of beds in the city in the years leading up to the 2016 Olympics generated seve ral complications for the industry at that time. The logic of this expansion is discussed throughout the paper during different phases and the aim is to help fill a gap left by empirical research in the area, which has little explored the logic behind the option of investing during Olympic Cycles.", "Keywords : Mega Events; Olympic Games; Tourism and Hospitality; Institutional Theory, Rio de Janeiro.", "1. Introduction", "On October 2nd, 2009, Rio de Janeiro was chosen during the election held in Copenhagen as the host city for the 31st edition of the 2016 Summer Olympics, beating Madrid in the final and other candidates such as Tokyo and Chicago in the preliminary phases. After two failed attempts (2004 and 2012), Brazil became the first country in South America to host the Olympics in the history of the modern games, which began in 1896. So far, 16 editions have taken place in Europe, 5 in North America, 3 in Asia, 2 in Oceania, and 1 in Central America.", "In this context, it should be noted that Brazil has recently experienced a phase marked by mega events such as the Military World Games (2011), the World Youth Day, the Confederations Cup (2013), The Rio+20 UN Conference on Sustainable Development (2013), the FIFA World Cup (2014), the Summer Olympic and Paralympic Games (2016), and the Soccer American Cup (2019). A dynamic that started with the Pan American Games of 2007 allowed Brazil and Rio to play an active part host ing the most important international events worldwide in a short period of time.", "In the case of Rio de Janeiro, the hotel sector stood out as one of the main challenges considering that at the time of its nomination in 2009, the city had less than 19,000 h otel rooms with the minimum required by the international Olympic committee being 40,000. Rio de Janeiro would need to resolve its historical gap both in the number of beds and the quality of the hospitality service provided, which was far below that requi red by international standards in terms of level of service and quality of rooms. Despite all the challenges faced along the way, Rio de Janeiro arrived on the eve of the Games with more than 51,000 rooms, representing a significant increase in the offer ( Rio Negócios, 2016).", "While seeing this as a moment of great opportunities for business expansion, great efforts would also have to be made to adapt the infrastructure of the City of Rio de Janeiro to meet all Olympic requirements (Embratur, 2016). Thus, th is article aimed to study the case of the City of Rio de Janeiro and its specificities, especially with regard to the phenomenon that triggered the accelerated expansion of the hotel industry during the years leading up to the games. It is worth mentioning that this expansion took place in the context of an emerging country that comes with an entire institutional complexity capable of generating great influence on the investment logic in several sectors of the industry (Cornelissen, 2010), such as tourism a nd hospitality.", "Despite the characteristics of the case of Rio de Janeiro, the demands of infrastructure that the modern Olympic Games brought over the years were quite similar to other host cities as all had to deal with issues involving urban mobility, accommodation, security, and others (Liao & Pitts, 2006). For this reason, understanding the phenomena investigated in this paper also becomes relevant for future situations once the Olympic Games are recurrent and take place periodically every two years i n the world, alternating between their winter and summer editions. Due its characteristics, there will always be governments and companies somewhere in the world investing in an Olympic agenda.", "Recent examples from other host cities such as Barcelona (199 2), Atlanta (1996), and Sidney (2000) have demonstrated how the Olympic games were largely responsible for attracting high levels of investments and created a friendly environment to accelerated economic growth and development with the exponential reductio n of unemployment rates, for example (Milan, 2016). Carvalho and Tang (2014) point out that hosting mega events such as the Olympic Games not only attracts new investments, but is also capable of generating a great appreciation of regional culture through greater visibility and international insertion that the hosting locations usually acquire during the period. However, there were also other recent cases such as Athens in 2004 that despite all the cultural rescue of the Greeks who invented the games, the O lympics of that year ended up becoming one of the main causes for the increase of the Greek debt, GDP shrinkage, and rising unemployment, triggering a serious crisis in the country (Karatassou, 2015). Also, according to Carvalho and Tang (2014), the case o f Rio de Janeiro was not very different. Although it was possible to observe positive aspects that led to a coordination of efforts and investments through public -private partnerships, the international appreciation of the Rio de Janeiro brand, and the eco nomic moment that the region experienced before and after hosting the games opens a discussion about the positive and negative aspects of its Olympic legacy. Recently Setti (2018) compared the Olympic arenas in Rio de Janeiro and Barcelona, highlighting th e underutilization and abandonment of Rio's infrastructure, while the Catalans preserve their legacy even after more than 20 years.", "Thus, tourism and hospitality, since it is one of the segments that has undergone the most changes in the case of Rio de Jan eiro and represented here by 7 hotel brands, this article proposes to dialogue more directly with works that have been concerned with understanding the logic of investment and expansion of the hotel chain such as the articles written by Farok & Sumit (1998 ), Rodríguez (2002), and Zhang, Guillet & Gao (2012). Its contributions also include evaluating the economic impacts of the Olympic Games in specific sectors of the economy, a point still little explored by the literature. Finally, this work made use of t he institutional theory perspective (North, 1990) to support its discussions with the following premises: (1) the institutional environment of a country or region directly influences the company’s investment options; (2) the political risk perceived may va ry according to the company background and its national or foreign origin; (3) incentives or constraints driven by mega event contexts affect the creation of a more or less favorable institutional environment. At the end, it is expected", "that we will be abl e to make not only theoretical propositions, but also practical recommendations for other hotel chains that have to make decisions over investments during mega event cycles. Beyond this introductory part, the study is structured with a session dedicated to literature review in addition to the method, findings, and discussion, along with a brief space for final considerations.", "2. Literature review", "2.1 Institutional environment, investments, and incentives", "The decision to expand investments or not in contexts of mega events, as well as in other situations, goes through a manager's decision -making process and takes into account several variables including the institutional one, which is an important factor capable of influencing the company’s behavior (Williamson, 1985). North (1990) defined institutions as the “rules of the game”, comprehending several incentives or constraints that can determine the attractiveness to the economic activity in certain markets. On the other hand, Scott (1995) said that the institutional environment is formed not only by formal institutions, but also of normative and cultural -cognitive systems called informal institutions4 composed by the regulatory, normative, and cultural -cogni tive pillars. Peng (2006) explained that the functionalities of the institutions reduce the uncertainties of a given environment. The rules and norms, as well the other pillars presented above, regulate the behavior of the society and determine what is acc eptable or not. Scott (2001) explained that depending on the characteristics and associations of these pillars, it would bring greater or lesser stability to social life in each region, contributing to the levels of business uncertainty and investment. Hil lman et al., (2004) added that in situations where high levels of institutional risk are observed, companies tend to choose more conservative strategies.", "Mathews (2006) called attention to the differences in the institutions from emerging and developed eco nomies where firms from developing countries choose to expand the operations to other markets to seek strategic resources while reducing institutional and market constraints in their home countries. Cuervo -Cazurra (2016) explained how four characteristics of the host country such as political uncertainty, violence, pro -market reforms, and geographic isolation can contribute to firms expanding to other markets. Companies chose to expand their business where they observed lower", "4 Taboos, customs, and traditions.", "risks or characteristics simila r to their home market.", "De Villa et al. (2018) added that the behavior of companies would be conditioned mainly to the institutional environment in which they are inserted combined with the perceived political risk. According to the authors, the perceived risk is conditioned not only to the behavior of local institutions, but also in the case of foreign companies to relations between governments and the configuration of institutions in the country of origin. Depending on the perceived risk, companies shoul d choose to adopt more or less engaged strategies. Oliver and Holzinger (2008) explained that the more familiar with local institutions a company became, an increase in their engagement with the host location could be seen, going from a low visibility stra tegy to a posture of anticipation where a closer relationship with the local government was implied. De Villa et al. (2018) pointed out once again that in the case of emerging regions such as Latin America, talking about political risk becomes even more re levant given the historical fragility presented in the institutions in most of these countries.", "Wheeler and Mody (1991) added that the decision for the allocation of international resources should be well studied and take into account not only the local institutional characteristics or the profile of the manager, but also other strategic issues such as the firm's available resources and the market structure and local competition. Buckley and Ghauri (2015) also said that this planning should be done not only for each intended region, but also according to the life cycle of the product and the market in which it will be inserted. In general aspects, the idea would be that different institutional environments demand different strategies of investment and risk t aking (Bruton et al., Regarding emerging markets, the focus of this study, the higher perceived institutional risks could be compensated by other ways (Adams, Régibeaue and Rockett, 2014). The authors have drawn attention to the various incentives that governments have been making to create an institutional environment that is favorable to direct investment and job creation. The creation of an institutional environment favorable to certain sectors or groups of companies, despite violating some free market rules, has been widely practiced over the years by governments around the world. Vézina (2010) explained that the most common incentive is fiscal with the reduction of taxes or tariffs for certain strategic segments. However, in some other cases it is possible to verify other normative subsidies as in the case of changing laws to make the activities of some sectors less bureaucratic.", "Very often emerging nations that host mega events make use of tax incentives during the construction and operation pha se to attract investment and develop sectors considered critical for the event. However, Tavares -Lehmann (2016) discussed the risk of living in an economy of incentives. According to the Author, the big problem would be the fact that many times these incen tives are indiscriminate, meaning that they do not select companies that would be able to better contribute to the local socioeconomic development, eventually attracting several bad investments when taking into account the interests of local society. Anoth er problem identified in the permanence of these policies is that in most cases they are not able to support economic crises or help companies to recover since in times of low economic activity it is common to observe tax deficits and the need to increase public revenue.", "2.2 Hotel chain investment choices", "Hernández and Nieto (2015) conducted an empirical study with a sample of almost 10,000 companies where they analyzed precisely the relationship between the institutional distance between the country of origin and the hosting location pointed out by Kostova (1999) in the option for the entry mode. In addition to their research reinforcing that the option for entry with higher levels of resource commitment is more propitious to movements where this distance is positively perceived, there was still a great difficulty on the part of companies in measuring or even identifying the nature of that distance, which according to the authors could go in several directions. The reluctance of firms to expand into more institutionally distant markets would also not contrib ute to their decrease since only through several shocks between different realities could a reduction be observed from the perceived institutional distance. Others studies also go in the same direction such as in the case of Aliouche and Schlentrich (2010) who studied the expansion of US hotel brands in China.", "Despite so many variables that together bring a high complexity to the choice and way of allocating resources in foreign markets, it is common to observe several companies launching themselves abroad in a reactive and unplanned manner (Cavusgil; Knight & Resenberger, 2009). The authors point out in their manual a step -by-step process of strategic measures that if not followed could lead to failure of direct investments in new markets. In addition to th ese steps, other strategic tools already consolidated in areas such as marketing (Kotler & Keller, 2007) could be adapted and come to contribute to the decision -making process about investing or not.", "The option to invest in a hotel chain follows the same l ogic as pointed out by Pla - Barber et al . (2011). In contexts where the company identifies a greater risk caused mainly by the perceived distance between the company's origins and the hosting market, it will be very common to observe options for entry modes with less commitment of resources such as franchising, brand licensing, or management contracts while direct investments such as purchasing property and the construction of a new hotel would come only in situations where greater control of variables and l ess perceived distance could be observed. Some of those entry modes and the contract arrangements made by several hotel brands around the world can be found in the study of Alon et al., (2012). Farok & Sumit (1998) were one of the first authors to study th e option for the international hotel chain to enter into foreign markets. The authors defend a varied use of entry strategies depending on each internationalization movement. For them, since it would not be possible to feel significant changes in the chara cteristics of the firm between one expansion or another, the main determinants would be in the specific variables of each of the countries or regions. In that sense, the local institutional would be of great importance for the option between a greater or l esser investment, which would condition greater or lesser control over the operation.", "Once again, for Andreu, Claver, and Quer (2017), the decision to expand investments in the hotel chain would go through two overriding factors. The first of them is very similar to the one already discussed, which is related to environmental issues of the hosting region with emphasis on variables such as business opportunity, local bureaucracy, country risk5, in addition to levels of political, financial, and institutional instability. The second factor in turn would be very related not only to the firm's background, but also to the risk profile of the manager in the role of decision maker, which are factors that contribute to the construction of a greater or lesser perceiv ed psychic distance (Johanson and Vahlne, 1977).", "More recently, Zhang, Guillet, & Gao (2012) studied the phenomenon that led to the expansion of the hotel chain in China, which went from 137 in 1978 to 14,237 in 2009, the year in which Beijing hosted its f irst Olympics. The authors identified that in this growth process, multinational hotel chains played a determining role in attracting foreign direct investment to the country given that, due to the characteristics of the", "5 The uncertainty associated with investing in a particular country .

The author mainly used the theory of transactio n costs and the cultural distance between the region of the headquarters from the subsidiary to justify the option for the entry mode. One of the most important findings is the fact that the hotel chains at the beginning of their expansion process tend to require higher levels of control over their operations and as they become more and more internationalized, it is more common to observe a greater sharing of this control with local partners.", "In recent years, Cypriano and Gándara (2011) called the attentio n for the change in the behavior of hotel investments. In their study about the performance of national and international hotel chains in Brazilian micro -regions, it was possible to identify that until the 2000s, it was common to observe a predominance of own resources in expansion and revitalization projects, especially for major brands. However, in the last 20 years the hotel sector has increasingly opted for less risky entry modes such as franchising, licensing, and management contracts.", "This change in the investment behavior could be explained by Canteras (2009), who identified the rise of the investment risk in the Brazilian hotel sector, which during the 1990s and 2000s went through a period of great supply boom. With the global financial crisis of 20 08, the main Brazilian capitals were already struggling with the low occupancy rates and the difficulty to compete with international destinations. Boyen and Ogasavara (2013) also identified that operating via franchise contracts has been a trend followed by other hotel brands located in emerging markets such as Brazil. In these regions, the risk of investment is commonly divided among different real estate investors who are responsible for the building and renovation of the hotels, and later hire the big b rands just to operate them. According to the authors, about 77% of new players entering the Brazilian hospitality sector opt for contractual and less risky modes. This number is higher compared with the 65% found in other regions of the world such as North America, Europe, and Asia (Contractor and Kundu, 1998).", "Markunas (2016) was another author who identified a great dispersion of players operating in the Brazilian hotel industry where about only 30% of the hotels are affiliated to any chain. Of these, it is important to highlight the presence of international real estate investment funds as the main owners of branded hotels in Brazil. In that sense, there is a", "grey territory between the real owners of the assets and the brands responsible for their operati on, making identifying the origin of capital in the enterprise even more difficult.", "2.3 Megaevents and tourism", "Since mega sporting events occur at least once a year somewhere in the world, it is relevant to study this phenomenon capable of generating tan gible and intangible benefits for the localities that receive them, especially regarding tourism flow (Hall, 1994). Even so, the real benefits of hosting mega events such as the Olympic Games are questionable since investments in infrastructure, marketing, and security tend to exceed the revenues obtained from tourism, ticket sales, or broadcasting rights (Preuss, 2004). Similar dynamics also occur with other mega events such as the FIFA World Cup (Allmers & Maennig, 2009) or other smaller competitions such as the Rugby World Cup Even so, the dispute of countries for the right to host mega sporting events around the world is visible. An answer to the possible negative financial returns may be precisely related to the intangible aspects generated in the destination image and in the long -term tourism behavior (Solberg & Preuss, 2006). According to the authors, there is a positive correlation between hosting mega sporting events and the increase in tourism flow – an impact that can be obser ved from the moment of the bid’s decision. In the case of the Sydney Olympic Games (2000), there was an increase of 48% in the flow of tourists between the years 1994 and 2000 with a positive impact also for the rest of the Oceania region.", "But perhaps the best example of a tourist legacy left to an Olympic city was the case of Barcelona (1992), which in the year of the games received 1.7 million visitors. That number would become 7.4 million in 2011 and 8.3 million in 2015, very significant figures for a ci ty that has a population of only 1.6 million (IOC, 2019).

According to Veja magazine (2017), in 2016 Brazil received a record number of 6.6 million foreign tourists at its airports.

Results and discussion", "4.1 Phase 1 - Expansion of investments in the City", "About a year after Rio de Janeiro was chosen to host the 2016 Olympic Games and after the main structural challenges of the City were mapped, such as the lack of beds, the mayor at that time signed three municipal laws on November 25, 2010 that comprised the legislative package with the objective of holding mega events in the city such as the 2014 World Cup and the 2016 Olympic Gam es. This set of laws can be understood as the institutional framework that made it possible to boost local businesses in specific sectors considered strategic to the city.", "The first of them, Law No. 5,229/2010, authorized the Executive Branch to create the company Rio 2016, which had the aim to speed up the investment of resources and better monitor the execution of projects for the World Cup and the Olympics. Law No. 5,230/2010, on the other hand, had as its main concern to develop the construction and operation of different means of accommodation in areas considered to be of interest for hosting mega events through municipal tax incentives. Finally, Complementary Law No. 108/2010 defined the urban parameters and norms for land use and occupation so as to encourage the expansion of the accommodation capacity in the city.", "Considering this, what was observed in the city of Rio de Janeiro in the early years was an attempt to create an environment, above all institutional, that was friendly to attracting new inv estments, reducing the psychic and institutional distance perceived by investors (Xu and Shenkar, 2002). It was a period in which there was a rapid expansion of the means of accommodation in the city with its peak in 2013 when 50 new licenses were register ed for the construction of hotels or requalification of the existing ones compared to the average of less than two licenses per year observed in the previous decade (Rio Negócios, 2016). Also according to figures from the agency, this phenomenon that occur red between 2010 and 2016 resulted in the creation of 70 new hotels, 5 renovations, and 15 other expansions in addition to 15,000 new direct jobs and 45,000 indirect jobs totaling R$ 6 billion in investments in the local hotel industry, which expanded in t he period through both direct investment and contractual modes of entry, the two most common entry modes of the sector as pointed out by Ivanova and Ivanov (2013). However, these numbers were only possible mainly due to the efforts of the city government a s pointed out by one of the interviewees (R14) when stating that “ there were several obstacles to the growth of the local hotel network, which historically had a large", "deficit in accommodation. We were simply not prepared to host the mega events that were to come ”. A different scenario was found in London (2012) where “ different from Rio de Janeiro, we couldn’t observe a great expansion of the hotel chains, once the sector was already very developed and capable to attend the demands of the IOC and the Games ” Returning to Rio, another respondent (R12) also pointed out that all these obstacles were tuned down because “ there was a lack of urban and construction incentives capable of making entrepreneurs invest in the city's hotel industry ”. The creation of a more attractive environment through incentives from nations around the world, especially in emerging regions, were also discussed by Li (2005). But the resumption took place precisely after the publication of the laws already mentioned above, which g ave incentive both to the phases of acquisition, construction, and operation of businesses. For the acquisition of new land, a 3 -year exemption from city taxes was given while in the construction phase there was also a 3 -year exemption from IPTU tax and a reduction in ISS from 5% to 0.5% during the period of the construction. All hotels opened by the end of 2015 also received a 60% reduction in the IPTU amount until the year of the Olympics in 2016. Other non -tax incentives, as in the normative area as pres ented by Adams, Régibeaue, and Rockett (2014) were also present in order to accept the occupation of regions of the city that were not allowed for commercial use before and also the use of 100% of the built area for bedrooms, compared to the previous 70%. These measures allowed the expansion of about 25% in the service capacity (Rio Negócios, 2016).", "Also, according to figures from the agency, what was observed during the years of 2011 and 2014 were 123 new licenses for the construction, expansion, or remode ling of hotels compared to 16 between the years 2002 and 2010. This expansion left the city of Rio de Janeiro with an accommodation capacity of more than 51,000 rooms and 110,000 beds on the eve of the 2016 Olympic Games compared to the little more than 31,000 rooms it had in 2010 considering only hotels and other traditional means of accommodation. In absolute numbers, the period registered an increase of about 62% in the number of beds in the city with 76% only in the offer of hotels, which went from less than 20,000 to almost 37,000 rooms in just 5 years. The Rio evolution can be better seen in Graph 1.", "If compared with London (2012), we could observe an increase of only 12% in the offer.

An interesting and typical phenomenon in the case of Rio de Janeiro was the fact that “ due to the ince ntive law, around 1,000 motel rooms were converted into hotels, many of which remained so after the end of the Olympics ” (R14).", "Figure 1 – Olympic clusters Rio 2016", "Source: adapted from Destination360 (2016)", "Another interviewee (R16) also pointed out t hat “ the geographic supply of beds has undergone important changes with the migration of hotels from traditional areas of the city such as Downtown and the South Zone to the West Zone of the City ” with a focus on the region where the Olympic Games took pla ce. Interestingly, Barra in 2013 represented about 19% of the city's bed supply and reached 27% in 2016, becoming the second neighborhood in the city with the highest offer behind only Copacabana. The South Zone in turn saw its share decrease from 48 to 41 % (Rio Negócios , 2016). The West Zone, a region that until then lived outside the city's traditional tourism route, was also the one that received the most investments in the area of urban mobility. Currently, hotels in the region that at the time took adv antage of the large offer of empty pieces of land that the neighborhood still had, now focus on event and corporate tourism (R02,", "However, it is important to note that the policy of incentives for the hotel sector stimulated by the City government in the period was not necessarily responsible for promoting a socio -spatial justice in the city. We can affirm this since it ended up privileging projects in the most distant regions and close to the Olympic park, while the more tourist neighborhoods downtow n and in the south zone were practically forgotten since they did not have available buildings or pieces of land capable of receiving these projects. While the Barra da Tijuca region received investments of BRL 7.3 billion in the period, the amounts of Deo doro, Maracanã, and Copacabana combined did not reach BRL 2.4 billion (Oliveira & Corradi, 2017). This geographic distribution can be better seen in Figure 1.", "4.2 Phase 2 - The changing situation and the beginning of the crisis", "However, before the 2016 Olympic Games took place, Brazil as a whole, but the city of Rio de Janeiro in particular, plunged into a deep political crisis aggravated mainly by low economic indicators and high unemployment rates (BBC, 2016). One of the main drivers of this crisis was the successive corruption scandals in civil construction contracts in an operation that became known worldwide as Lava -Jato, or Carwash. The findings of the investigations took millions of people to the streets in popular mobiliza tions for the end of corruption across the country and ended up culminating in the resignation and prison of the Governor of the state of Rio de Janeiro Sergio Cabral in 2014 and the impeachment of the President of the Republic in 2015. After the Olympics, Sergio Cabral’s successor, Fernando Pezão, was also arrested in 2018 accused of corruption. Kwok and Tadesse (2006) had highlighted the impacts of corruption and other illegal practices for the distrust of the investors, causing a direct impact on FDI as well local investments.", "Public security has also been a recurring problem in the city and by the year 2017 presented its worst numbers since 2009 with a 17% increase in the rate of violent crimes compared to 2016 ( Exame , 2017). But despite the turbulent moment that the government and the city was going through, one of the respondents pointed out that \" the City of Rio de Janeiro still seemed to present good economic health, a certain immunity to everything that happened in the state and in the country \". Such “immunity” was mainly due to the construction and the direct investment that mobilized the city for the Olympics. In parallel to this, the state and the region was immersed in a deep economic and fiscal crisis.", "Between the years of 2016 and 2018, it wa s common to observe delay in the payments and division of public employee salaries (G1, 2019).", "However, right after the end of the Olympic Games, the opposition won the city elections and with that came a great rupture. One of the interviewees (R11) poin ted out that “ from the moment of the change in the municipal government, the apparent good financial health that the city seemed to enjoy gave way to a totally different reality. ” It was a period when the high public debt became evident, causing investment s and economic activity to fall. Another respondent (R14) added that “ this rupture also brought about the discontinuity of all public incentive policies that were part of the other government and caused the discontinuation of important agencies such as Rio Negócios and Rio Convention ”, entities that in previous years had played a fundamental role in attracting new investments to the city.", "These ruptures also contributed to the deterioration of the destination image in the eyes of the investors (Metaxas, 20 10). It is important to note that these government transitions were not peaceful as exposed above. During the period analyzed, two governors were arrested, one president deposed, and another two former presidents detained. The city government was also accu sed of improbity with the Olympic contracts but was never convicted. That way, the government ruptures and scandals at all levels of power contributed to the discontinuity of public policies and loss of the investor trust. A picture of this is that, after reaching third place in the Kearney Foreign Direct Investment Confidence Index7 in 2013, Brazil accumulated negative results in recent years, going from ranking in the 12th position in 2016 to 22nd in 2020 (Kearney, 2020).", "Another interviewee (R10) also sa id that “ because it was one of the industries that invested the most in the last few years, the hotel and hospitality sector in the city was also one of those that suffered the most ”. With the end of the incentives and a large increase in the beds offer, t he sector began to go through a period of great difficulties as it saw occupancy rates plummet from almost 100% close to mega events to an average of 51% in 2017 (Data Rio, 2019). According to reports from the agency, in 2010, the average annual occupancy rate in the city reached 79%. One of the respondents (R10) pointed out that “ there was no planning to think about the post -Olympic period, such as a calendar of periodic events that could keep up the demand for the coming years as well ”.", "7 Annual survey that tracks the impact of political, economic, and regulatory changes on the FDI intentions and preferences of top executives form global companies around the world.", "So after the pheno menon of explosion in the offer, a drop in demand combined with the end of tax incentives culminated in the closing of some hotels around the city, many of which were recently opened for the 2016 Olympics (R01). The non -sustainability of operations through tax incentives was seen in the case of Rio de Janeiro and had already been pointed out in studies of Tavares -Lehmann (2016).", "As a classic example of this dynamic is Hotel Nacional, one of the largest hotels in Rio de Janeiro with more than 400 rooms and 40 years of history. Closed since 1995, this original project of Niemeyer went through a remodeling process of BRL 430 million to attend the Olympics and reopened in 2016 under the Spanish brand Gran Meliá and a 20-year contract of administration, but it e nded up closing its doors in March 2018 after operating for less than 2 years ( O Globo , 2018). Also according to the agency, in the 2 years that followed the Olympics Rio de Janeiro observed the closing of 16 hotels in the city, many of which were newly op ened. Together these hotels represented an offer of more than 2,800 rooms.", "It should be noted in this context that several interviewees (R04, R06, R10) identified the explosion of accommodation offer by platform, which went from zero to 33,000 active ads in the same period, as one of the main changes responsible for the hotel crisis. One of them (R03) even said that “ the mega events were not beneficial for the sector. Soon after the Olympics, the sector started to lead a tariff war as a way of trying to attract new customers and compensate for the drop in the occupancy rate ”. But this phenomenon that led up to the explosion of the hosting by platforms and the informal tourism was a global movement that was happening in other regions of the world much before 2016 (Guttentag, 2013), and even so the local hotel industry did not foresee that. Although on a smaller scale, London also showed the presence of hosting by platform, a model that emerged in 2009, and by the time of the 2012 Olympics it was in full expan sion. During the weeks when the Olympic Games took place, it was already possible to observe an additional offer of 6,000 Airbnb offers with a 75% occupancy rate (CBS, Still according to respondent (R03), the new dynamics that took place in the sect or started to be harmful to all players, mainly to those new hotels built in the west part of the city, which were outside the traditional tourist route and were dependent on a non - existent calendar of events and also on corporate contracts from industries such as offshore, which had their activity greatly reduced.", "In this period, in addition to the increase in the traditional hotel offer and the expansion of the accommodation model by platform, the hotel sector also suffered from competition from the motel s (R14). During the Olympic period, one of the respondents (R09) further explained that “ the City, fearing that demand could not be absorbed by the local offer, hired some transatlantic ships to stay at the port during the games ”. Although this attitude wa s widely criticized at the time by the local hotel association (R04), as it is a coastal city, Rio de Janeiro inevitably ends up most of the year on the transatlantic route with some ships having more than 2,000 rooms.", "Due to the problems in generating re venue, one of the interviewees said that \"hotels in this period had to reinvent themselves and invest in experience tourism with the offer of new activities inside and outside their facilities \". Despite these new possibilities, the hotel chain ended up als o facing new competitors such as tourist agencies, and more recently the experience hosted by a platform such as Airbnb Experience and Rent a Local Friend. Still in this process of diversification, many of the new hotels were built with their own conventio n centers and sought to bring events into their facilities, usually associated with accommodation and consummation of guests (R17). Even so, the hotels found themselves in difficulties due to the region having other large convention centers in addition to an agenda of mega events limited to Carnaval , New Year's Eve, and Rock in Rio.", "4.3 Phase 3 - The new market dynamics and recovery expectations In this new dynamic that has set in, the local hotel chain has been going through a process of forced adaptation . Such necessity of adjustment was also seen in other locations with high concentration of hotel offers as in the case of Manhattan in the 1990s when the tariffs quickly dropped and several units were closed to face the scenario of global crises (Baum and Mezias, 1992). According to one of the respondents (R06) \" in addition to the projects that were closed, it is very common to find hotels with entire floors unused in addition to a reduced team in an attempt to eliminate costs and continue operating \". All t his difficulty that the sector faces goes almost unnoticed in the eyes of the consumer. These in turn see this change as positive in recent years since with the mega events there has been an improvement in the quality of the service provided and a drop in the city’s average tariff.", "Another positive factor was that \"this new dynamic has even increased the regional tourism of Brazilians from other states and Latin Americans who historically", "avoided Rio de Janeiro because they considered it a high -cost destina tion\". Nowadays, about 60% of all foreign tourists visiting Rio de Janeiro are Latin American with a prominence of Argentines who represented about 20% of the international tourists in 2008 with that number reaching almost 38% in 2018 (Turismo.gov, 2018).", "It is also possible to observe a change in the lifestyle of the carioca himself who has chosen to spend the night in hotels in situations where they will meet commitments in more distant regions at hours of the day considered as riskier. The opening of ho tel facilities for day use and breakfast has also become increasingly common in all types and classes of establishments.", "Thus, a few years after the Olympic Games and in the beginning of the crisis, the local hotel chain is still going through an adaptatio n process (R02). In general terms, although the sector as a whole complains about this new dynamic that has installed itself with increased competition and falling prices, it is possible to notice that the brands that chose a more conservative investment s uch as the expansion and requalification of existing units, have been facing the crisis better. Those conservative postures were most seen on national hotel chains mostly because of the different understandings of the local conjecture and familiarity with the institutional environment over time (Hillman et al., In order to exemplify, in 2016 the Brazilian hotel chain was mostly composed by independent brands (89.8%) that were responsible for 66.3% of the total offer of rooms. Only 10.2% of the hotel s were linked to a national or international group. Even so, what was observed in the period between 2016 and 2019 was a growth of national brands compared to international ones. While the national chain had a positive balance of 159 new hotels, the intern ational ones opened just 72, representing a comparative growth 55% lower than the national network (JLL, 2019).", "Despite expectations of stabilization and recovery in the sector, which in 2019 after 3 consecutive years of decline showed a growth of 4.7% (JL L, 2019), in 2020 these were once again frustrated by the new coronavirus pandemic (COVID -19). Worldwide, the tourism industry suffered a 70% drop in the first 8 months of 2020 alone. The fall represents 700 million fewer tourist arrivals and USD 730 billi on losses for the sector, 8 times higher than that registered by the 2008 financial crisis (G1, 2020). In Rio de Janeiro, with the cancellation of its main attractions such as Carnaval and Réveillon , the hotel sector laid off about 20% of its workforce. In addition, about 90 hotels in the city had to suspend their activities temporarily, and those that remained open registered occupancy", "rates around 20%, practically restricted to health professionals and offshore operators (El", "4.4 Integrated d ata analysis", "In order to understand this new conjuncture, a new theoretical framework (Figure 2) was proposed where it was attempted to map through the respondents' statements along with the dialogue with the key concepts of the literature proposing how it has behaved in the face of the main challenges of this sector. Called the model of competitive pressures in traditional hospitality, one of the main contributions of the model is that opportunities can be seen and failures avoided through strategic planning based on t he mapping of challenges (Cavusgil, Knight & Resenberger, 2009) in situations that present similar contexts. It is important to note that mega events such as the Olympics occur periodically every 2 years and certainly Rio de Janeiro will not be the last ci ty to present a deficit in the number of beds.", "Going more precisely into how the framework dynamics works, it starts from the point of view of a hotel chain. Around it we have its direct and indirect competitors, which in the new context were expanded due to the need for adapting to the new environment. The types of customers and sources of revenue were also diversified and now come as opportunities to be explored. At the bottom of the model we still have the challenges classified as traditional and emergin g with this last one arising mainly due to technological advances in the past few years. All of these 20 actors divided into 5 different groups are responsible for putting positive and negative pressure on the hotel chain located in the center of the model . The level of pressure can be even greater or less depending on the institutional environment in question (North, 1990; Scott, 2001; Peng, According to R02, \" if previously the types of clients in the tourism and hospitality industry were limited t o leisure and corporate clients, due to the need to seek new sources of revenue, events are increasingly being given importance to a new type of client \" who are those in the city to go to an event or attend events within the premises of the hotel that has space for conventions. To a lesser extent, there are also contracts with airline crews as they are important for generating a regular flow through the months. It is important to say that this category of customer does not reach unanimity among all responde nts and there are still those who like to deal with the question between the two original categories (corporate and leisure).", "Figure 2 – Model of competitive pressures in traditional hospitality", "Source: prepared by the author", "In this new dynamic, all these customers would then be willing to spend also with food and beverages in addition to the traditional accommodation. Due to the tariff war that started in the city after the Olympics, more and more hotels need to seek diversification in the sources of revenue and investment (Cypriano and Gándara, 2011), and according to R17, “ the diversification of the way in which hotels operate has also opened space to explore tourism experience and also part of corporate events such as fairs and conferences, or pers onal events such as weddings and birthdays ”. It is important to highlight that event tourism (Fourie and Santana -Gallego, 2011), was a sector considered strategic in the meetings of the hotel association, which is why the vast majority of new hotels in th e city of Rio de Janeiro have a space for this (R04). Thus, the frameworks consider not only traditional sources of revenues, but also add the possibility of gains with hosting events and offering experiences to the customers. In this sense, hotels are now adays offering even more complementary services to add value to the guest experience not only within their facilities, but also outside. Much more than *Motels, Hostels, and FlatsNEW CHALLENGES TRADITIONAL CHALLENGESSOURCES OF REVENUETYPES OF CUSTOMER COMPETITORS HOTEL TRADITIONAL HOSPITALITYHOSTING PLATFORMS OTHER TRADITIONAL WAYS OF HOSTING*TOURISM AGENCIES CONVENTION CENTERSTRANSATLANTICSLEISURE CLIENT CORPORATE CLIENT EVENTS CLIENT AIR CREW ACCOMMODATION FOOD AND BEVERAGES EVENTS EXPERIENCES OTAsNEW VIDEOCONFERENCE TECHNOLOGIESPUBLIC SECURITY PERCEPTIONS OF THE MEDIAPOLITICAL INSTITUTIONAL INSECURITY OTHER NATIONAL AND FOREIGN LOCATIONSGOVERNMENTASSOCIATIONS AND PROMOTIONAL AGENCIES", "organizing City Tours or visiting traditional tourist spots, tourism of experience aims to connect trave lers with experiences closer to those lived by the locals (Sebrae, 2015). At the center of the model and positioned beyond traditional competitors is hosting by platform, which is increasingly becoming a preference among young people and adults up to age 3 0 (Airbnb, 2016). The ocean transatlantic, due to the coastal characteristics of the city, has also become an alternative accommodation in the summer. Due to the Games taking place during the southern hemisphere winter, the presence of transatlantic cruise ships in the city during that period would not be common, but this way of accommodation, traditional at other times of the year, ended up becoming an option also for the Olympic period.", "Due to the diversification of the areas of activity, tourism agencies for the experience part and the traditional convention centers end up becoming indirect competitors. As explained by one of the respondents (R17), “ in some cases, however, some hotels have become so specialized in the part of events that they end up becom ing a reference in small and medium -sized events for up to 4,000 people ”. With the transformations suffered by the city and in the hospitality industry, there were an expansion of the number of direct competitors now with the presence of new and definitive entries such as the hosting platforms, motels, and convention centers. All of these issues would still be inserted in an environment of high institutional and regulatory pressure (Bruton et al ., 2014) represented in the model through the government an d industry associations. Agents who have a strong influence on the main challenges listed by the respondents and their actions have a major contribution to political risk (De Villa et al., 2018) and consequently to the psychical and institutional distance perceived by investors, as well as the challenges classified as rational with emphasis on institutional insecurity and issues of public security, historically problematic due to the characteristics of the emerging regions (Cuervo -Cazurra, 2016). Other impo rtant issues, such as the perceptions of a media that is almost always negative toward the city, do not contribute to the development of the destination’s image (Metaxas, 2010) . Finally, one of the interviewees (R10) further explained that “ as far as the e vent market is concerned, other regional markets, such as our neighboring city of São Paulo, have shown to be one of the main competitors in attracting new events to Rio de Janeiro ”. Other issues classified as new challenges and that appeared in several sp eeches (R01, R04, R10) are closely related to the advances in videoconferencing technologies and virtual reality, which increasingly give way to business trips and face -to-face", "meetings. These options, despite demanding high initial investments, in the lon g-term bring savings for companies, causing even more shrinking of the corporate tourism public (Solberg and Preuss, 2006). Still in this sense, one of the interviewees (R03) also pointed out that “ online travel agencies (OTAs) such as Booking.com, despite facilitating the search for accommodation, give hotels greater visibility and transparency towards customers and are responsible for the stay of a good part of the margins, about 20% ”.", "5. Final considerations", "The objective of the present work was to understand how the behavior of the hotel sector unfolded in the city of Rio de Janeiro during and after the Olympic period and the logic that involved the decision -making process that led to investments of BRL 6 billion in the sector in a space of 5 years. Despite major improvements in the period, the city has experienced what we classify here as the paradox of mega events, since the explosion in the number of beds combined with the lack of strategic planning (Cavusgil, Knight & Resenberger, 2009) by both h otel brands and the city, especially in what we call the post - Olympic period contributing to the increase of the political -economic crisis in the sector. Working in home office, virtual meetings, and digital conferences were already becoming a global tren d that was further stimulated by the COVID -19 pandemic in 2020, and the expectations are that the digitalization will directly affect corporate tourism. In Brazil almost 50% of the companies adopted remote work during the pandemic, of which 63% intend to m aintain home office for part or the entirety of their staff after the COVID - 19 crisis (Ebc, 2020). Even with the vaccine, business travel is expected to fall by up to 36% worldwide driven mainly by the travel segment of sales and conferences (WSJ, 2020). T his will impact not only hotels, but the entire tourism economy such as airlines, restaurants, and services in general.", "Regarding the institutional point of view (North, 1990; Scott, 1995), the mega events paradox can also be seen. During the years from th e Olympic nomination to the years leading up to the 2016 Olympic Games, what was observed in the different spheres of government, especially at the city level, were measures capable of promoting the socioeconomic development of the city by creating an inst itutional environment capable of positively affecting the attractiveness of new business and investments in Rio. In this sense, these statements are in line with two of the premises presented at the beginning of this work: (1) the institutional environment of a country or region directly influence the company’s investment options and (3) incentives or constraints driven by mega event", "contexts affect the creation of a more or less favorable institutional environment. However, with the advancement of the poli tical and economic crisis that took place in the country mainly from 2015, many of the projects were not finished and the investment levels drop considerably. The political contradictions caused by the lack of a post-event planning, a permanent calendar of events for the city, and the problems of public security, corruption, and impeachment of the local governments also contributed to the crisis in the sector, a situation that deteriorates even more with the COVID -19 sanitary crisis lived by the world and B razil in 2020. The impacts of this new conjecture contributed for the rise of institutional insecurity and distance observed (Kostova, 1999) among investors.", "Cornelissen (2010) already pointed out the more negative than positive aspects that mega events c ould bring, especially in countries said to be emerging. According to the author, in those locations it is very common to see the overlapping of political interests over the real economic and social development gains brought by the event. Liu and Wilson (2 014) were others to identify negative impacts of hosting mega sporting events such as price inflation, increase in crime rates, environmental pollution, and risk of diseases due to international tourist arrivals. Oliveira (2015) commented on Rio’s recent experience with the FIFA World Cup (2014) and the Olympic Games (2016). In both episodes, the lack of coordination between the city, state, and central governments generated a political and institutional rupture responsible for making the projects not serve the interests of the population, compromising the possibilities of legacy. With this we believe that this work and the framework presented will be able to help managers in their strategic planning and decision -making process in direct investments in futur e cases where they present similar conjuncture of mega events and the lack of specific services offer as was the case for the hotel sector in Rio de Janeiro. It is expected that with studies like this, hotel chains and Olympic cities do not repeat the same mistakes as those observed in Rio’s edition. In this sense, it is necessary to map all the competitors involved and define strategies that take into consideration long -term scenarios and include the post -event period. Considering that the Olympic Games ta ke place every 2 years and the localities said to be in emerging countries have increasingly gained representativeness in recent years, observing mistakes and strengths of past cases can be decisive for the success of the event and its legacy both for soci ety and the local economy and businesses.", "However, it is believed that further studies still need to be carried out in order to", "extrapolate the findings of this study to other situations that present a similar context, as is the case of emerging regions re ceiving mega events that present accommodation deficits. Also, the difficulty in identifying the investment origins of the national and foreign hotel brands visited was a limitation of this research, as this could be an important variable capable of affect ing the perceived investment risk of the companies. Because of this limitation, although there is a tendency that points us in that direction, it was not possible to validate at this first moment the second premise: (2) the political risk perceived may var y according to the company background and its national or foreign origin. In that sense, further investigations will be necessary in order to test the model dynamics in other contexts with an even greater diversity of cases and actors that represent a more direct view of hosting through a platform, which has currently presented itself as one of the main competitors to traditional hospitality.", "SECTION 4", "COVID -19, SUSTAINABILITY AND OLYMPIC GAMES: WHICH LESSONS WE CAN TAKE FROM TOKYO 2020*?", "Abstract : This paper aims to understand how the sustainability theme has been incorporated into the new Olympic planning guidelines based on analysing the case of Tokyo 2020, which was severely impacted by the COVID -19 pandemic. For this, a field research using the case study method was carried out that involved 21 in -depth interviews with experts from different entities affected by the event. As a result, it was possible to identify that some characteristics already presented in the Tokyo project c ame to break away from the gigantism observed in the past Olympic editions in an attempt to demonstrate alignment with the new principles brought by the IOC 2020 and 2020+5 Agenda that had as one of its main objectives to simplify the Olympics, making the event more sustainable and accessible for future host societies. At the end, some trends for the future of the Olympic Games are also presented in order to guide future studies in the area, as well as help the future host cities and their companies in plan ning their investments.", "Keywords : Olympic Games; Tokyo 2020; COVID -19; Mega Sporting Events; Sustainability.", "1. Introduction", "In recent years, the Olympic movement has been through a process of readjustment in order to become more sustainable and accessible to future host cities. In 2014, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) approved the 2020 Agenda, a document composed of 4 0 principles for guiding the new directions of the Olympic movement, making it more sustainable, egalitarian, and inclusive (IOC, 2021). However, the impacts caused by COVID -19 in the 2020 Games ended up generating a need to revise the entire model that th e Olympics usually followed. Although the world has already experienced three other Olympic cancellations such as the cases of Berlin (1916), Tokyo (1940), and London (1944) due to the First and Second World Wars, never before in all of its 125 years of mo dern history had it seen the decision to postpone the Games, which at that time was only about 4 months away from its original date.", "The implications of this decision taken by the Japanese Government in the face of the pandemic escalation, which by March 2 4th had already registered more than 386,000 infections and 16,000 deaths — a number that by the end of 2020 would reach 1.8 million — across the 5 continents (WHO, 2020), made Tokyo a protagonist of interrupting the Olympic cycle for the second time in hi story. Despite the difficulty in specifying the losses of an Olympic cancellation or postponement, especially for the host cities in the first half of the 20th century, it is estimated that Japan, by the end of 2019, would have officially spent about US$ 1 2.6 billion on the 2020 Olympic Games with the intention of receiving around 600,000 foreign visitors and an estimated income of US$ 2.24 billion (Japan Times, 2020).", "Even though in the months that followed several measures were announced to simplify even more the Games to lower its costs, the decision to postpone resulted in a direct hit of US$ 2.76 billion to the Japanese government and US$ 800 million for the IOC in addition to a negative impact of around 1.4% on the country’s GDP and a drop of 24.4% in the revenue of local companies (Japan Times, 2020). Allied to this, if a definitive cancellation became a reality, this could generate direct and indirect losses of US$ 184 billion to the Japanese economy (SMBC, 2020). Even though the Olympic Games took place a year after the original date, in mid -2021 we saw an event of closed doors and a long way from its traditional form, which gave rise to several other ethical discussions, especially involving the future of the international mega sporting events as it was still not known how the pandemic experience could impact the social relations in a near future where the recovery process could still take several years for poor emerging nations or countries, which were the ones mostly affected by the virus.", "Therefor e, despite the contributions of recent publications toward understanding a new Olympic moment in terms of governance (Parent, 2008), legacy (Chappelet, 2019), and sustainability (Müller et al., 2021), there is still a gap to be explored regarding the accel eration of those changes in a post -pandemic world where the businesses, sports, and even the social relations need to be rethought due the transformations brought by the sanitary crisis. Thinking about a new model of Olympic Games in a context of investmen t limitations for projects of this nature must be one of the main concerns of the IOC for the following years in order to preserve the interest of future host -cities in the event. This can be said once the increased cost and dubious legacy brought by the l ast Olympic editions, has made more and more societies, cities and countries resistant for biding or hosting mega sporting events (McBride, 2021). In part, these questions explain Brisbane's solo", "candidacy for the 2032 Games, putting in check the way of th inking and the long -term sustainability of the Olympic projects.", "In a world each time more concerned with environmental, sustainability and governance (ESG) issues, the necessity of rethink entire agendas is not an exclusivity of the sporting or event ind ustry, it actually follows a global trend recently reinforced by the UN 2030 Agenda that promotes 17 sustainable development objectives through 169 goals that seek, beyond others, the eradication of poverty and the reduction of social inequality in the wor ld (Tsalis et al ., 2020). Several sustainability aspects of the international Agendas could already be observed in the Tokyo project and will certainly remain as trends for the Olympic Games in the future. However, the additional costs generated by the pos tponement due to COVID -19 crisis ended up putting an even greater pressure on an Olympics that from the beginning had divided opinions in the Japanese society. Therefore, this qualitative study has the objective to understand from the case of Tokyo 2020 ho w the sustainability theme has been incorporated into the new Olympic planning guidelines. To this, beyond this introductory part, this work is divided into a session of literature review followed by method, case discussion and analysis, and a brief part f or final considerations.", "2. Literature Review", "2.1 Olympic Games and Sustainability", "To talk about Olympic Games and sustainability, it is necessary to go back 30 years in the past, to the 1990s, where the IOC, motivated by the discussions on sustainable development that were gaining traction in the world, began to request that the environ mental issues be contemplated by the candidate cities in their proposals (Paquette et al., 2008). As a result, Lillehammer in Norway was the first host city to formally adopt environmental principles at the 1994 Winter Olympics. According to the authors, i n the years that followed, it was possible to observe an increasing importance put on environmental issues in the actions promoted by the IOC. Therefore, this theme soon became one of the three pillars of the Olympic movement, along with sport and culture. By the 2000s, the Olympic movement was already an active voice with regards to global environmental issues. To ensure reducing the impact provoked by the Olympic Games, the IOC developed its own sustainability agenda so that these principles could be incorporated through sport in the actions of other members of the Olympic family (IOC, 1999). So, starting in 2001, the IOC proposed creating a study that was responsible for", "measuring the impacts of the Olympic Games (Holden et al., 2008). According to the authors, the report to be produced by the organizers of each Olympic edition aimed to promote economic, social, and environmental sustainability of the Games along with leaving a positive legacy of knowledge for future hosts (Holden et al., 2008). From the Games of Torino in 2006, it was already possible to observe concrete actions in direction to a more sustainable Games model (TOROC, 2006). The Italian city bought carbon credits from countries such as India, Sri -Lanka, and Eritrea in order to compensate for the polluting gases produced during the construction and operation of the arenas. Soon after, Beijing (2008) was another city to use the Olympic Games of that year to make an effort to reduce the high levels of pollution historically found in the city (Mo l, 2010). According to the author, the promise of a green Olympics resulted in improving the city's air quality (Mol, 2010). In 1998 the air quality indexes were satisfactory only 100 days of the year, but in 2008 that number reached 274 days. In 2010, how ever, Vancouver brought new sustainability parameters (IOC, 2010). Acknowledged as the greenest Games in history, the city showed that sustainability should go beyond the environmental issues at hand and also include other spheres such as economic and soci al. Vancouver showed a successful model that included using renewable energy, neutralization of carbon emissions, and the involvement of the local community in the economy generated by the Games.", "With the increasing importance of the sustainability discuss ions in the world, this topic continues to be relevant among recent Olympic projects, as can be seen in the most recent cases of London (2012) and Rio de Janeiro (2016) (Trendafilova et al., 2018). According to Baroghi et al., (2018), the expanded sustaina bility concept adopted in 2010 also tends to be a trend for future editions since it takes into account not only environmental issues, but also the impacts on the urban development of cities and their public accounts, local economic growth, social developm ent, poverty reduction, urban mobility, transformation of green spaces, carbon emissions, among others.", "Despite the growing relevance over the years of the sustainability agenda in the world, what has been observed in practice is an increasing complexity o f the Games in terms of size, players, and investments, whose many projects still struggle in being transformed into positive legacies for the societies affected (Agha et al., 2012). This new dynamic of recent editions has made the Olympic idea, once highl y desired, become each time less interesting for cities around the world, even affecting the long -term sustainability of the model. Due to the need to recover the interest of potential host cities,", "less than a year after Tokyo was elected to host the 2020 Olympics, the IOC published in 2014 the 2020 Agenda, a document composed of 40 principles that aimed to provide new directions for the Olympic movement through a more sustainable and, above all, less costly games. These ideas had to be recently reinforced by the 15 additional principles of the 2020+5 Agenda, which besides the reinforcement of the need of having more than ever a sustainable Games model, also encouraged the digitization of sport as an alternative to the threat brought by the COVID -19 pandemic (IOC, 2021).

Attention to this point on the part of the organizers goes through both the difficulty in specifying the real cost of an Olympics and the escalation of expenses historically observed over the editions (Zarnowski, 1993). According to the author, around US$ 17,000 was spent per athlete in regressive values at the Athens Games (1896), while at the Nazi Germany Games of Berlin (1936) this expense reached US$ 53,000 per athlete, with this value passing the mark of US$ 1 million at the first Asian Games of Tokyo (1964). Barcelona (1992), despite being considered an example in terms of planning and legacy, was the most expensive Olympic edition of the 20th century at an approximate cost of US$ 7 billion (Brune t, 1995), almost double the US$ 3.6 billion spent in Atlanta (1996). According to the author, the biggest difference of Barcelona may have been a public -private partnership model that made it possible to transfer almost 40% of the expenses of the Olympic G ames that year to the private sector. In the following editions, the cost of the Olympic Games would increase even more, reaching US$ 15.2 billion in Nagano (1998), US$ 16 billion in Athens (2004), US$ 45 billion in Beijing (2008), and US$ 51 billion in So chi (2014), where the most expensive edition in history was recorded, 1Strengthen the uniqueness and the universality of the Olympic Games", "2Foster sustainable Olympic Games", "3Reinforce athletes’ rights and responsibilities", "4Continue to attract best athletes", "5Further strengthen safe sport and the protection of clean athletes", "6Enhance and promote the Road to the Olympic Games", "7Coordinate the harmonisation of the sports calendar", "8Grow digital engagement with people", "9Encourage the development of virtual sports and further engage with video gaming communities 10Strengthen the role of sport as an important enabler for the UN Sustainable Development Goals 11Strengthen the support to refugees and populations affected by displacement", "12Reach out beyond the Olympic community", "13Continue to lead by example in corporate citizenship", "14Strengthen the Olympic Movement through good governance", "15Innovate revenue generation modelsAgenda 2020+5", "especially if considering that over the years winter editions have been presenting considerably lower costs than summer editions (CRF, 2019).", "Another problem historically registered during the Olympic editions is spending much more than planned. Flyvbjerg et al. (2016) pointed out that from the 1960s to 2016, there was an average expenditure 156% above budget with a negative contrast for Sochi the authors, the main reasons for these numbers have been the lack of experience of the organizers in managing events of this size combined with allegations of corruption and overpricing in construction and communication network contracts (Flyvbjerg et al ., 2016). Thus, the risk over investments and the high amounts involved have generated popular pressures among candidate cities, as observed in the candidacy withdrawal of Krakow and Stockholm for the 2022 Winter Games, and Budapest, Hamburg, and Rome for the 2024 Summer Games (CNN, 2017).", "In this sense, authors such as Pappa & Brückner (2015) have questioned the real advantages of hosting international mega sporting events. Altho ugh these may present themselves as an opportunity to improve local socioeconomic indicators, sometimes the need for credit and an increase in public debts end up generating negative impacts in the medium term. Overmyer (2017) also found that the financial responsibilities generated by the Olympic Games contributed to the escalation of local crises in several recent editions with a negative contrast for the case of Athens in 2004. It is also difficult to identify a clear positive correlation in the ability of international mega sporting events to attract international investments (Jakobsen et al ., 2012). According to the authors, between 1970 and 2009, it was possible to observe more negative than positive impacts from the main international sports competiti ons from an economic point of view, which may generate concerns by future hosts regarding the economic sustainability that the model of the Olympic Games practiced until then had been presenting.", "One of the main challenges faced by the IOC and the host cit ies in bringing economic sustainability to the Olympic projects has been the difficulty in dealing with the already mentioned gigantism assumed by the last Olympic editions (Chappelet, 2013), which since its first edition in 1896 has gone from 14 events, 2 50 athletes, and 14 countries to 306 events, 11,238 athletes, and 206 countries in 2016, which is a movement that still seems to continue with the inclusion of 5 new sports modalities in the Tokyo Games, increasing the number of events to 339 (IOC, 2016). For Paris (2024), new modalities have already been announced, reaching a total of 38, a number considerably", "higher than the 21 practiced in the Games of the 1970s and 1980s. With this, the proportions taken by the Olympic Games ended up increasing the leve l complexity of the event and consequent cost of the project, going against the sustainability and social responsibility pillars defended by the speech of the IOC 2020 Agenda (clearly seen on recommendations 3, 4, 5, 12, 27, 29, 30, & 31), recently reinfor ced by its 2020+5 Agenda update (recommendations 2, 10, & 14).", "3. Method", "An abductive -qualitative research approach was used in preparation for this research. According to Peirce (1974), the abductive rationality is fruitful in situations where the resear cher’s objective is to discover new things, variables or relationships. That way, the main concern of this research logic will be rather than the confirmation of existing theories, generate new concepts and the development of theoretical models. The use of the abductive approach also represented for this paper the possibility of comings and comings to the field. This movement, allowed the discover of new phenomena’s that directly affected and adjusted the original research design. Dubois and Gaddle (2002), also discuss about the possibilities brought by the combined use of the abductive logic with the case study method in the creation of new theoretical frameworks. The authors says that the methodology can be a good option for the explanation of an industry behaviour and structures in specific contexts. Besides this, the case study is a method already widely used to identify factors that determine or contribute to the occurrence of a phenomenon, explaining its causes (Eisenhardt, 1989).", "In order to increase t he validity of researches that make use of the case study, Yin (2010) is another author that defends the use of the method combined with different sources of evidence in a way that encourages the lines of convergence of investigation. Therefore, besides th e paper has chosen the Tokyo 2020 case as main objective of analysis, the field world of this research brought together the perspective of 21 interviewees belonging to 18 different entities who at the time of the postponement of the Tokyo Olympic Games in March 2020 were directly or indirectly affected by the decision. Therefore, these combined perspectives form the Tokyo 2020 case help us identify the singularities of the Tokyo project and its alignment with the new sustainability standards brought by Agen da 2020. In order to better illustrates the environment which takes the events of the case, some difficulties and adaptations that companies and organizers had to make in the midst of the first Olympic postponement in history are also presented.", "Data coll ection took place through secondary sources of analysis such as scientific and journalistic articles, and from primary sources retrieved from the Tokyo 2020 organizes, from semi -structured interviews with middle and senior management of companies or entiti es affected by the postponement, as well as from researchers from institutions around the world that followed the paths and changes in the Olympic movement. The interviews were done between August and October 2020 through videoconference tools such as Zoom Inc., which allowed a simultaneous interaction between the interviewer and the interviewee, having also the presence of a supervising professor in order to allow the observation of the phenomenon through a second perspective.

The following variables were identified as threats: (1) health security, (2) public security, (3) political and institutional security, (4) natural disasters and climate changes, Trends Agenda 2020 Agenda 2020+5 Sustainability of the projects 1, 2, 4, 5, 20, 21, 33 & 39 2 & 10 Expense rationalization 1, 2, 3, 7, 9, 10, 12 & 13 2 & 14 Geographic permeability 1 & 2 Digital transformation in sport 19, 20, 22 & 23 8 & 9", "(5) information technology security, and (6) gigantism.

These correlations with the Olympic agenda recommendations can be seen on Table 4 .", "4. Tokyo 2020 Case", "4.1 Phase 1 - Tokyo's preparation for the 2020 Olympic Games", "On September 7, 2013, Tokyo was chosen as the host of the 32nd edition of the Olympic Summer Games in an election held in the city of Buenos Aires, beating Istanbul in the final and Madrid in the preliminaries. After a failed attempt in 2016, Japan would now have the opportunity to host its second summer Olympics in its history and the fourth in total when considering the winter games. Since the start of the Olympic Games in the modern era in 1896, the Asian continent already had the opportunity to host six Olympics, three summer editions (Tokyo 1964, Seoul 1988, and Beijing 2008), and three winter editions (Sapporo 1972, Nagano 1998, and Pyeongchang 2018).", "Despite the real benefits of hosting an Olympics in terms of return on investment could be questioned (McHugh, 2007), Tokyo's intentio ns as a host city for the 2020 Olympics came as a proposal to recover and boost the Japanese society's morale, which was still very shaken by the Fukushima nuclear disaster in 2011, at least that was the government's internal speech as pointed out by one o f its respondents: “ It was hoped that with the Olympics, the Japanese people could forget the damage caused by the Tsunami in 2011. The games would serve as a symbol of the reconstruction of Japanese society which has been so affected by several natural di sasters over the past few years ” (R12). This speech gains even more strength considering that the year 2011 was also the beginning of the 2020 Olympics bid, which only came to an end in 2013 with the victory of Tokyo. With that, Japan would be in fact the first organizer that had the opportunity to absorb the Agenda 2020 recommendations during all its preparation.", "However, several critical comments were made by the local society which saw no logic in an Olympic bid that would cost billions in the midst of one of the most tragic episodes in Japanese history, as follows: “ Actually, the government wanted to mask with the Olympics what happened in Fukushima and ended up transferring valuable resources to set up the Olympics while the real problems continued in the region, even almost 10 years after the episode ” (R01). Reports pointed out (Holt et al., 2012) that the earthquake", "followed by the tsunami and the nuclear disaster that plagued Japan in 2011 were responsible for leaving almost 20,000 dead or missing in addition to about 100,000 people homeless. The region's total recovery time was estimated at 40 years at a cost of approximately US$ 75 billion. Those costs, if summed with the other billions spent on the Olympic project, could put considerable pressure o n the Japanese finances. Despite the turbulent context surrounding the Tokyo candidacy, the city brought an initial speech of holding a more conscious and sustainable Olympics in terms of spending (Flyvbjerg et al ., 2016), demonstrating an alignment with the Agenda 2020 points as proposed by the IOC as a guide for the future of the Olympic movement (IOC, 2020). As presented before and reinforced by one of the respondents, the “ Agenda 2020 aimed, among other issues, to stop the exacerbated proportions that the Olympic Games took over the last editions. In the case of Tokyo, it was possible to observe a proposal that opted mainly to use the infrastructure already available in the city ” (R05). Therefore, the city prese nted in its project the adaptations of infrastructures designed to meet the Games of 1964 in addition to renting private spaces already used for other gathering purposes with temporary arenas, which require less investment and could be easily dismantled so on after the Games. Recently approved in 2021, the IOC 2020+5 Agenda reinforces the main pillars of its predecessor with 15 new trends that should guide the Olympic Games to a future even more sustainable and digitalized (IOC, 2021).", "Thus, the Tokyo 2020 p roject was guided by 5 general principles that aimed not only at the internal operation of the Games, but also the articulation with other entities and societies in the expectation of leaving a legacy for people and the planet (Tokyo 2020, 2018). The first transformation made possible by the Olympic Games was to provide a reduction in carbon emissions by 60% doing the competitions in existing arenas, in addition to creating a public transport system fully based on electricity. Those actions were expected to generate a reduction of 80,000 tons of carbon emission in Japan until the Games. The second was a zero -waste policy aimed to recycle or reuse 99% of everything that was consumed by the Olympics. One example of these actions is that all the Olympic medals would be made of recycled metals from electronics collected all around Japan. The third predicted a greater integration of the city with nature by laying at least 130 kilometres of anti -heat pavements, building green areas around the competition venues, an d protecting biodiversity. The fourth pillar brought inclusive measures to use minorities in the gaming economy while promoting diversity, demonstrating an alignment with the United Nations objectives for protecting human", "rights. Finally, the Tokyo 2020 pr oject also predicted a more sustainable model with the involvement of local societies through educational measures of cooperation by creating a network since 2014 responsible for promoting debates and promoting the Olympic values between colleges around Ja pan and the world. The Tokyo sustainability plan started to be designed even before the candidacy plan with almost 150 pages of projects to be implemented. The results of these programs would also be available for future hosts in the Olympic Games Global I mpact (OGGI) final report, a method that started in the early 2000s and until today are one of the commitments of the host cities.", "However, the results of the promised savings or sustainability are not clear if numbers are observed. If compared to the pas t editions, the US$ 12.6 billion officially spent for the 2020 Olympics is just slightly below the US$ 13.2 billion invested on Rio 2016 or the US$ 14.8 billion of London in 2012 (McBride, 2021). Amounts that when most recently revisited in fact had alre ady reached US$ 15.8 billion, more than double the initial US$ 7.3 billion project that won the bid in 2013 (Flyvbjerg et al ., 2020). According to the authors, since 1960, it is common for the Olympic Games to exceed budgets by far and for this reason they end up being characterized as high -risk investments. This issue is evident in the speech of one of the interviewees: “ Although we hear a lot about Agenda 2020 and a more sustainable game model, the impression we get is that the reality is different, and t hese issues are only in the speeches ” (R13). Still, in terms of public spending and in the midst of all the peculiarities faced by this edition, Tokyo represents huge advances compared to the cost of other Asian Games recently held such as Beijing (US$ 45 billion) and Sochi (US$ 51 billion).", "Although Japan maintains a permanent investment attraction program, no specific policy towards the Tokyo 2020 Games was found with regards to incentives (JETRO, 2020). The expectation was that, motivated by the Olympics , the private sector would invest around US$ 96 billion in the city in initiatives related to technology such as the internet and transmission networks, in addition to infrastructure to support tourism such as hotels, restaurants, and other business establ ishments (Cord, 2018). The expectations extracted from the agency data was that the public investments would leave a tangible and intangible legacy (Preuss, 2007) of more than US$ 310 billion and 2 million additional jobs for the region, while of these, US $ 35 billion would be spent on urban mobility projects, US$ 6.2 billion on building arenas, and US$ 3.9 billion on the Olympic village.", "Due to the infrastructure already present in the city, perhaps the Tokyo 2020 project has not been as transformative or attractive as seen in past editions. Unlike the 1964 Games that took place in the midst of a period of great recovery and economic growth – later described as the “Japanese miracle” (Rattner, 2003) – in 2020 it was not possible to observe disruptive transf ormations since the city of Tokyo was already highly developed and connected compared to most cities in the world. In this sense, one of the interviewees described that “ apart from expanding some roads or modernizing one subway station or another, we have not seen major impacts on the day -to-day of the city. As for buildings, perhaps what catches our attention the most is the new Olympic stadium ” (R21).", "Besides this strategy demonstrating once more an attempt of alignment with the sustainability principles already presented, slight transformations observed in the region contributed toward a splitting of optimism in the Japanese society in general. “ While it was not common to hear people comment on the streets about the Olympics, on the other hand, there was a clear expectation from businessmen in the sectors that would be most impacted, such as food, construction, tourism, and hospitality ” (R16). During this period, there was also a large investment by the government in portraying an image in order to attrac t more international tourists and make Japanese society more friendly to other cultures. One of the interviewees pointed out that “ It was a period when there was a greater concern with the introduction of foreign languages in everyday life, such as in advertisements, signs, and websites in English in an attempt to break the stigma that Japanese are a closed people ” (R08). These efforts led Japan to jump from around 5 million international tourist arrivals in 2011 when there was an Olympic bid to more than 30 million in 2019. This numbers also began attracting the attention of international hotel brands, now ever more present in the country (JNTO, 2020). The expectations were that the gain in tourism would be an important legacy for the Japanese economy, he lping to reduce the impact of the Olympic investment.", "As in other editions, there was also an increase in investment for preparing athletes made possible mainly by the participation of large Japanese companies in sponsorship actions that helped to develop the local sport, and despite the different aspects involved in the Tokyo 2020 project, perhaps its greatest legacy was in the social and educational aspect through projects such as “Sports for tomorrow”, an international cooperation action involving more than 10 million people and 100 countries with the objective of disseminating the values of sport and promoting international cooperation", "(Lengrand, 2019). One of the interviewees pointed out about the program and possibility of an intangible legacy (Preu ss, 2015): “ Sports for tomorrow was an initiative led by the Japanese government that involved several countries and universities concerned with forming tomorrow's leaders and leaving, somehow, a legacy for humanity from an event that we often forget about its real essence and meaning ” (R19). Programs like this one follows the Agenda 2020 recommendations, as can be seen in principle 22.", "4.2 Phase 2 – The postponement and its impacts", "Unlike past editions such as Rio in 2016 where there were several problem s in the delivery schedule of the venues (Dolzan & Barsetti, 2014), Tokyo began the year of 2020 with most of its infrastructure designed to hold the Games already finished and this could be partly answered by the fact that “ Japanese culture usually has a great sense of commitment, and even about eight months before the games we could see the new Olympic stadium already ready and receiving test events ” (R18). The feeling was that everything was on schedule and the city would arrive in July and August of tha t year without major complications, at least as to what depended on the local organization. At that time it was thought that only a natural catastrophe such a large -scale earthquake or tsunami could compromise the Olympic games. “ From the beginning, the IO C was uncomfortable with the frequency of earthquakes that occur in Japan every year. To this sense, adaptations had to be made in the original project in order to get sailing sports out of Tokyo Bay due to the risk of tsunamis ” (R11). As part of these ada ptations, sports competitions could be seen taking place across the entire country, as in the case of football and baseball. The preparation of not only Tokyo, but also of all athletes around the world, was affected by a pandemic wave that started in the city of Wuhan in China on December 1, 2019, and soon spread to the rest of the world (Komarova et al. 2020). Although local authorities were reluctant to admit at first the possibility of any impact on the Games, an escalation of cases forced them to annou nce on March 24, 2020 – when the world had already registered more than 380,000 cases – the decision to postpone the event by 12 months. “ There was a denial on the part of the Tokyo government for some time because in reality no one knew the proportions th at the pandemic was going to take. But due to the escalation of international pressure and the impossibility of ensuring the security of delegations and spectators, there was no alternative but to postpone ” (R13). Soon after this decision, a period of grea t uncertainty ensued since the number of stakeholders affected was enormous, as heard by one of the interviewees: “ We are not", "only talking about stopping the construction or refunding tickets already sold, but the impact of this postponement is much greate r than could be imagined. It affects athletes, companies, contracts, and even people who would move to the Olympic village and had to postpone their life plans ” (R19). The insecurity of everyone who was affected in some way by the Games was even greater co nsidering that historically it was known that the duration of major pandemics, or the average time to develop a vaccine, was considerably longer than 12 months (BBC, 2020). The decision to postpone also put pressure on the Olympic project finances, which b ecame even more expensive since it was impossible to be sure if the Games would actually take place.", "A survey developed by the Japan External Trade Organization (JETRO, 2020) was carried out shortly after the decision to postpone aimed to measure the econ omic impacts of the pandemic on the business of companies affiliated with investments in Japan. The survey included 376 multinational companies based in Europe (42.6%), Asia and Oceania (38%), North America (17%), and other continents (2.4%). Of these, the majority (67.3%) had at least one commercial subsidiary in Tokyo and identified the negative impacts of COVID -19 on business in 93.4% of the cases. The main reasons cited were issues such as a drop in demand in local consumption, a decrease in purchase or ders, and a reduction in customers due to travel restrictions imposed by the necessity of social distancing. The sectors of tourism and transport were the most negatively impacted, while the exception was for companies in the agricultural sector which did not observe significant impacts on their businesses.", "The second part of the survey took into account the objectives of the companies in view of the current situation. 37.5% of the companies would choose to maintain their existing businesses, while 22.6% in tended to expand as planned, and another 22% would delay their expansion plans. According to JETRO, in 2019 when there was a similar survey, 70.3% of the companies planned to expand their business, thus showing a significant decrease in the annual comparis on. Companies listed retaining customers, ensuring cash flow, communicating with customers via new digital tools (Dugalić, 2018), and innovative alternatives in the supply chain as the main challenges for expanding or maintaining business. Finally, the sur vey also measured the need for financial support by companies (Cruz -Castro et al., 2017) with 44% of the companies indicating they needed assistance with cash flow through government guarantees or access to subsidized funds, while another 13.9% pointed in the direction of tax incentives.", "Therefore, as in other countries, it was possible to see some emergency aid policies from the Japanese government to help companies, as observed: “ Here the government offered loans at subsidized interest rates to companies, in addition to 100,000 Yen aid for all residents in order to stimulate the economy, but that still was not enough to avoid several layoffs and bankruptcies ” (R07). Due to the closing of borders with other countries, the government also began to strongly e ncourage domestic tourism, such as the GoTo Program, which provided subsidies of up to 50% on tickets, lodging, meals, and tourist attractions for nationals and residents to visit other parts of the country (Furutani, 2020). Even so, the campaign faced som e resistance since \" in some cities in the countryside that were not used to receiving people from outside there were reports of persecutions and threats to tourists, especially from other cultures \" (R01). The positive impact of those efforts are also diffi cult to evaluate since what was seen at the Olympics in 2021 were the competitions behind closed doors and the absence of international tourists.", "Another challenge faced by the Tokyo 2020 organizing committee was the fact that most of the foreign workers who contributed in preparing for the Games had to leave the country in the early days of the lockdown. In previous years, the local organizing committee had received several employees transferred from government agencies or sponsoring companies who were no w called back to fill their original positions due to the escalation of the crisis. “ This previously unprecedented dynamic presented by Tokyo 2020, at first generated cost savings, but to cover possible staff shortages, it had to bring a workforce of quest ionable quality since many of them did not understand the business they were working with ” (R15). As a result, this strategy that in a first view could have contributed toward the financial responsibility of the project, ended up generating a high turnover that translated into empty positions on the organizing committee right at the beginning of the pandemic.", "This staff issue comes to aggravate another problem caused by the postponement, which was precisely the renegotiation of contracts with thousands of suppliers. “ Due to the strategy adopted in using several private spaces, the renegotiation of dates proved to be a major complication since many of these spaces were not available for the following year ” (R19). Furthermore, a strategy concerned in deliverin g a more sustainable model of the Games became one of the main concerns of the organizers after the postponement. It is also worth remembering that this contractual renegotiation occurred in several spheres and also affected international federations and n ational", "Olympic confederations that had already planned to go to Tokyo for the Games in 2020. From that, the position adopted by the organizers was to try and deliver a simplified version of the Games (Overmyer, 2017) focusing solely on sports in an attemp t to mitigate the additional impact of US$ 2.8 billion due to the postponement (Reuters, 2020). Even with the sports competitions taking place a year after the original date, the intangible costs caused by the empty stadiums, the lack of tourists in the st reets, or the escalation of COVID -19 cases during the Olympic weeks would still need to be absorbed by a society divided in the face one of the most questionable Olympic editions in recent history.", "5 Results and Discussion", "Eleven threats and trends resulting from the Tokyo 2020 case have emerged as one of the main findings of this work, which are variables that have been gaining strength mainly since the publication of the 2020 Agenda by the IOC in 2014 and now deserves even more attention due to the context of the sanitary, political, and economic crisis left in the world by COVID -19. These threats combined have put at risk not only the Tokyo 2020 Olympics, but also have affected the Olympic Games of the future, especially w ith regard to the long -term sustainability of the model. The dynamics can be better observed in Figure 1.", "Figure 1 – Treats and trends of the Olympic Movement", "Source: prepared by the author Public Security Political and Institutional SecurityHealth Security Olympic Games Trends for the Future Expense RationalizationLegacy ManagementProject Sustainability Geographic PermeabilityDigital TransformationNatural IssuesInformation Technology Security Gigantism", "Allied to the logic that drives today’s Olympic Games model, the sanitary issue can be seen as one of the main concerns not only for future Olympics, but also for the entire sport industry. The scenario revived by the COVID -19 pandemic brings attention once again to the importance of health security for holding meg a sporting events, which in addition to promoting large agglomerations, is responsible for a considerable international flow of people. Attention goes to the fact that “ This is not an unprecedented fact. Rio 2016 came to be threatened because of the epidem ic of Zika and Chikungunya fever that affected the city at the time ” (R15).", "In addition to this, there are also the natural disasters, which in the case of Tokyo, has always been present over the years. Included in the risk category for other regions that do not have a history of earthquakes or tsunamis is the presence of very high or low temperatures, which makes the practice of outdoor sports difficult. For example, this difficulty can also be seen at the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar that besides having to make larger investments in air conditioning technologies of stadiums and squares, had to change the event’s usual dates in the year in order to avoid the high temperatures that the region has in July.", "The issue of gigantism (Lee et al., 2008), which is the excessive proportion that the Olympic Games have taken on in the last editions, also comes into play here as a threat since “ if not corrected, we will observe less and less countries interested in hosting the Olympics, precisely because of the absur d investment and no return that it requires ” (R03). As observed from the history of the Olympic Games, gigantism has turned out to be one of the biggest challenges for a truly sustainable model of Olympics as defended by the 2020 Agenda. In the case of Tok yo 2020, despite the city taking important steps in the opposite direction of past editions such as using temporary arenas and valuing existing infrastructure, more concrete results that prove the possibility of a financially sustainable Olympiad are still distant.", "Other issues such as public security or political and institutional security, although were not decisive in Tokyo, have already been very present in past editions such as Rio 2016 or Beijing 2008 and tend to increase the pressure of the internat ional community on the organizers (Russo and Figueira, 2021). Finally, an unprecedented perspective may be the risk related to information technology security since the Games entered into the world of digital transformation and started to make intensive us e of technology (Xiao et al., 2007), making them more susceptible to cyber and hacker attacks.", "At the Tokyo 2020 opening ceremony, for example, it was possible to observe problems at times when they depended on technologies such as using drones, which ende d up failing due to technical problems.", "In view of what was discussed so far, 5 trends have emerged for the future of the Olympic Games and mega sporting events in general from a combination of the field and reinforced by discussions going on in the liter ature and in the IOC Agenda (Table 4 ). Therefore, project sustainability could be highlighted (Mol, 2010; Trendafilova et al., 2018; Baroghi et al., 2018) in a world where there is no more space for unsustainable Olympic editions, whether in environmental or economic terms. The host cities can no longer afford huge and expensive venues with no future applicability. Projects more and more must put the society and the environment they affect as greater protagonists.", "This issue also gives rise to a logic of ra tionalization of expenses (Flyvbjerg et al., 2016; Pappa & Brückner, 2015; Overmyer, 2017) considering that the gigantism that the Olympics has now taken on puts in check holding the Games in the future due to the growing shortage of interested candidates. Neither is there a clear relationship of impacts and benefits caused by the Olympic Games, which is closely linked to the legacy management capacity (Cashman, 2002; Preuss, 2007; Scheu et al. 2019) that the hosting regions have been demonstrating through the editions. Despite the advances in articulating the theme since the 2000s, the lack of long -term planning of cities with the IOC has meant that many of the possible benefits expected to be brought by the event are not achieved. In this sense, a successf ul implementation of the legacy plan would be directly related to the long -term sustainability of the event since the more benefits the Olympic project brings to society, the more justifiable are the investments. As a way of making today’s model more viabl e, a possible solution is to allow greater geographic permeability (Lee et al., 2008; Beissel & Kohe 2020; Chappelet 2013), moving from host cities to thinking in host regions or host countries. Currently, few cities in the world have this investment power , and when thinking about a regional games model, it can become a viable alternative to increasing the geographic turnover necessary for the sustainability of the event’s model. It is important to know that this possibility of accepting applications combin ing more than one city or country was already included in Tokyo 2020, which set competition venues for Football, Surfing, Mountain Bike, and Baseball spread across at least 5 different cities such as Miyagi, Saitama, Yokohama, Fukushima, and Sapporo (Tokyo 2020, 2018). A similar situation was also seen in", "London (2012) with competitions taking place across the entire United Kingdom. The FIFA World Cup, another mega event of global impact presented this model to the world in 2002 with Korea and Japan, an exa mple followed by Mexico, United States, and Finally, the situation of the COVID -19 pandemic also served to further accelerate the digital transformation process (Xiao et al., 2007; Dugalić 2018; Seele & Lock 2017) that was underway, and was now reinforced by the IOC with the publication of the 2020+5 agenda that encourages the digital engagement, esports, and interactions with the community of gamers (IOC, 2021). The escalation of remote work together with other technologies already implemen ted in several areas of sport should create a model of the Olympic Games in the future that is even more digital, technological, and connected with different regions of the world. Japan, historically known for its proximity to technology and robotics, had since the beginning embedded digital transformation as one of the pillars of their candidacy for the 2020 Olympics. In this sense, Seele & Lock (2017) also add that digitization will become part of one of the principles of sustainability, since by using di gital platforms it will be possible to save several non -renewable natural resources. In a way to better justify the choice of trends and threats presented in the model, in the Appendix 1 it is possible to observe in a more structured way how each of the va riables emerged with the help of the citations of the interviewees.", "6 Final Considerations", "The present study aimed to analyse how the sustainability theme has been incorporated into the new Olympic planning guidelines, transforming not only the way that T okyo implemented its project, but also affecting the future of mega sporting events. But before to answer the paper research question, is important to highlight that in the midst of all the transformations that need to take place in order to make the Games once more accessible and sustainable for future hosts, organizers still need to be alert to other environmental threats that could put billions of dollars of the Olympic projects at risk, such as the cases of public security (Rio 2016), political and inst itutional security (Beijing 2008), and Gigantism (Sochi 2014) observed in past editions. Themes related to natural issues (earthquakes and tsunamis), IT security (most technological Games in history), and health security (pandemic COVID -19), though they ha ve always existed, were in greater evidence in the Tokyo 2020 case. Such threats, in addition to affecting what happens with", "the Olympic Games themselves, also impact the day -to-day lives and investments of companies and organizations.", "Based on these threa ts and the way in which the Olympic Games model has been conducted so far, 5 research recommendations based on the Olympic trends ( Image 1) are presented here in order to guide researches concerned in studying the Olympic Games of the future, as the next e ditions need to be even closer to the sustainability principles (Paquette et al., 2008) of inclusion and equality promoted by the IOC 2020 Agenda and that are incorporated into the UN 2030 recommendations. Principles of sustainability and digitalization re cently reinforced by the IOC 2020+5 Agenda (IOC, 2021) had to be considered mainly motivated by the COVID -19 crises in order to ensure the continuity of a model that in the last few years were suffering from the growing lack of interest of society. Thus, t he research agendas recommended are presented below:", "(1) Explore the Olympic Games sustainability in their largest sense, including not only environmental issues, but also economic and social aspects.", "(2) Understand the importance and how the rationaliza tion of the Olympic project expenses will impact the sustainability of the Olympic cycles in the medium and long term.", "(3) Investigate alternative legacy management methodologies in order to justify the high Olympic investment, balancing the benefits brou ght by the event.", "(4) Look into the possibilities of combined Olympic candidatures as a way to make the event more accessible, sharing costs and risks among locations.", "(5) Observe how the digital transformation experienced in the world with the intensive use of technology in sports will affect the Olympic games model and other mega sport events.", "It is hoped that these findings will pave the way for researchers to investig ate other international mega sport events with similar characteristics. Despite the IOC stating that 88% of the Agenda 2020 had already been achieved (IOC, 2021), further investigations are needed to identify how future events will assimilate those princip les, even more so", "now at a moment of systemic crisis that, independent of their motivation, usually are cyclical and tend to invariably repeat themselves sooner or later (García -Sánchez and Returning the answering of the research question pre sented through the paper and also at the beginning of this closure section, from the case observed can be said that besides the attempts of Tokyo to promote a more sustainable Olympic project, the unpredictable facts brought by COVID -19 pushed the event an other way. The US$ 1 trillion in losses left by COVID -19 in 2020 (UNCTAD, 2019) points in favour of the need for better contingency plans on the part of not only governments, but also companies and organizations, and make us rethink the entire way that the mega sporting events have been being conducted so far. The Tokyo Olympic Games in 2020 were just one example of how the unpredictability of the escalation of a viral scenario faced in our daily lives resulted in losses of around US$ 2.8 billion for the or ganizers with the postponement without considering the various other indirect investments made, an impact that should be even greater with the decision of holding the Games behind “closed doors” for international fans (BBC, 2021).", "As for the limitations o f this study, there was a certain degree of difficulty in interpreting an ongoing event with direct and indirect impacts that could take years to emerge. These difficulties are obviously reflected in the limitation of the results found here and for this re ason further investigation is needed especially with regards to how the threats and trends suggested here will affect the sustainability of the Olympic movement in the near future. Investigations in this direction, as well as a better understanding of the Olympic Games in times of crisis such as that triggered by COVID -19, can still bring several theoretical and practical contributions in a business that moves billions of dollars wherever it goes.", "7.

At the time of their nomination, the ability of the Brazilian and Japanese agencies to deliver not only the venues, but also all the infrastructures responsible for hosting the events was completely different, but in both cases, probl ems and difficulties were found in the management of the megaprojects. If the lack of experience and instable political and institutional environment (as could be seen in section 3 of this study ), was one of the main complicating factors in the Brazilian case, Tokyo still had to deal with COVID -19 – one of the biggest pandemics in human history that completely changed the way of planning and deliver the Olympic Games (Dalton & Taylor, 2021) .", "Thus, this study brings as main research objective to understand h ow the business environment in the context of the Olympic Games has mobilized and attracted direct investments to the hosting regions over the last few editions ? To this end, the discussions were structured over three scientific papers, one theoretical and two empirical. The first paper was concerned with analyzing how, over the years, the literature has discussed the themes of direct investment and the Olympic Games in different realities. The articles of the literature review stage were evaluated using a mixed methods of analysis that separated them into two different groups. The first group, as they were less relevant for the purpose of the research, underwent to a quantitative bibliometric analysis in R Studio, while the remaining articles of greater rel evance, in addition to the bibliometric analysis, also went to a qualitative content analysis, responsible for categorizing them into three subgroups that took into account the “ impact of the Olympic Games on foreign issues ”; the “ event impact on domestic issues ”; and also “ the impact of the event on the destination image of the hosting regions ”. With this, it was possible to create a theoretical framework that was concerned in listing the challenges and opportunities for the investment flows in mega -event contexts (Figure 1) . The model, who helps in the answering of the section 2 research specific objective, has, in its center, the origin of the investments, which could be from public, domestic private or foreign private origin.

As major pressures (challenges) for the realization and success of these events, 7 main variables were mapped, from which we can highlight issues that took into account the pressures of the media, international political pressures, public security, health security, migrations, human rights, and political freedom. Some of these, for example, were very evident in the 2016 Rio project, such as the public safety problems (Kennelly & Watt, 2012) , and also the health security challenges posed by the COVID -19 pandemic in the Tokyo case between 2020 and 2021 (Dalton & Taylor, 2021) .", "Figure 1 – The direct investment flows in big events context (Challenges & Opportunities)", "Source: prepared by the author", "The model also presents six other main legacies as a result of the event, which could be positive and negative, tangible and intangible (Preuss, 2015).

The research presented the vision of different national and foreign hotel brands that expanded their business in the city in the years that precede the 2016 Games. In order to bring validity to the respondents' speeches and cross -check information, public agencies and sector entities linked to the local tourism and hotel industry were also visited. Such combined perspectives ended up forming the “Great Case of Rio de Janeiro”.", "The field interviews were responsible for generating 254 pages of primary data, which, after analysis and categorization, enabled the identification of 20 variables di vided into 5 different groups. This dynamic helped to formulate a theoretical framework called model of competitive pressures in traditional hospitality (Figure 2) , who assisted us in the answering of the section 3 research specific objective of this study , concerned with the understanding on how specific sectors of the industry as tourism and hospitality behave, in terms of organic growth and investments, during Olympic cycles? Due to the crisis caused by the explosion in the supply of beds and accommodati on options, together with the economic downturn and political crisis that hit the region in the period following the Games, the model proposes from the perspective of a traditional hotel chain, to identify and understand the new dynamics of competitiveness in the sector. In the center, it is possible to observe new competitive entrants who, due to the need for diversification of the hotels in the period, began to compete from beyond the traditional means of accommodation such as hotels, motels, hostels and flats. As a result, it was possible to observe in this group the presence of hosting by platforms like Airbnb (Guttentag, 2013) , in addition to travel agencies, convention centers and even cruise ships.", "As a result of this diversification, necessary for th e survival of hotel chains in the new context, together with the expansion of competitors there was also an increase in possibilities both in terms of types of customers and sources of revenue. In the model, leisure and business customers have increasingly shared space with crew stays,", "responsible for long -term contracts, as well event customers. On the other hand, in the quadrant of revenue sources, due to the price war that took place in the city at the time, the revenue from accommodation needs to be com plemented by food and drink, in addition to experiences and even events. In order to exert pressure on this dynamic, 6 major challenges were identified, divided between two subgroups of traditional and emerging ones. As traditional, issues such as public s afety, political and institutional instability, perceptions of the media and other national and foreign destinations can be highlighted. Is also important to say at this point that some of these had already appeared in the model of paper 1 of this work. As new challenges, online travel agencies and new videoconferencing technologies was highlighted. In this sense, with the acceleration of the digital transformation in the world (Dugalic, 2018), specially from 2020 due to the COVID -19 pandemic, was also poss ible to see the advancement of these technologies that proved to be a real alternative to face -to-face meetings. Changes that in the long term also tends to affect the dynamics of corporate tourism (WSJ, 2020). In addition to this, it would still be possib le to identify the presence of the government and sectorial entities responsible for regulating and influencing, positively or negatively, these flows. With the findings of the paper, it was possible to test and validate two of the three propositions of th e article, being them: (1 ) the institutional environment of a country or region directly influences the company's investment options and (2) incentives or constraints driven by contexts of mega -events affect the creation of a more or less favorable institu tional environment . On the other hand, due to the difficulty in identifying the investments origin (Eden & Miller, 2004), that were made in the local hotel industry, despite the presence of national and foreign brands, these brands do not always hold the ownership the hotel, which is in many times belonging to private real estate investors. Thus, it was not possible to validate the second premise of the study, which considered: (3) the perceived political risk may vary according to the company's trajectory and its national or foreign origin .", "The planning problems observed in the case of Rio and other international mega sporting events of the period meant that over the years the relationship between cost x benefits (legacies) brought by the event became incre asingly uninteresting for countries and companies to invest in an Olympic agenda (Flyvbjerg et al., 2020). Thus, the third paper analyses how the theme of the financial sustainability has been incorporated into the Olympic projects since the publication of Agenda 2020 in 2014, and more recently Agenda 2020+5 in 2021. To this end, the research assessed how these issues were", "incorporated into the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, which at the time was still undergoing additional challenges due to the COVID -19 pandemic, th at led to the first postponement in the Olympic history and a closed -doors Games in the following year.", "Figure 2 – Model of competitive pressures in traditional hospitality", "Source: prepared by the author", "As a field work for this stage, a new round of in-depth interviews was carried out with companies and organizations belonging to three different groups. In the first group we had companies with businesses in Tokyo that were directly impacted by the Games postponement, the second group were related to en tities directly and indirectly linked to the organization of the Olympic Games itself, while the third group consisted of research centers specialized in Olympic studies that were already been following the transformations in the Games model over the years . The 248 pages of primary content generated from the transcription of the interview’s speeches, together with other secondary sources collected during the period, helped to identify 11 variables categorized between threats and trends to the future of the Olympic movement.

Such dynamics can be b etter seen in Figure 3 , who helps, once more, in the clarification of the section 4 research specific objective, concerned with how the financial sustainability theme has been incorporated into the new Olympic agenda, especially since the impact of the pan demic on the Tokyo 2020 Games?", "It is important to mention that some of these threats were already present in previous articles of this work, as in the case of public security (Bennett & Haggerty, 2012) , institutional political security (Sugden & Tomlinson, 2012), and even health security (Halchin & Rollins, 2017) , which in a context of global pandemic very present in the Tokyo Games, ended up gaining even more importance. Other variables such as the gigantism of the Games (Chappelet, 2013) , issues such as natural disasters and global warming (Nybo et al., 2021) , and also the information technology security (Prieto et al., 2011) due to the acceleration of digital transformation in the world and in the Games itself, end up being very evident in th e Japanese case. On the other hand, as a way to mitigate part of these threats, other trends emerged, such as in the case of the projects increasing sustainability (Baroghi et al., 2018) , which involves both better management of the Olympic legacy (Preuss, 2015) , and also rationalization of the infrastructure costs (Overmyer, 2017), in order to break with the gigantism of previous editions (Lee et al., 2008). Still with the objective of proposing an alternative to the high costs and risks involved in an Oly mpic project, the possibility of greater geographic permeability (Beissel & Kohe, 2020), from shared candidacies between different cities and countries ends up also coming as a trend for the future not only of the Games, but also for other international me ga sporting events. Finally, we also had the impact of technology on sport, which influence not only the way to deliver the event, but also to interact with the public (Dugalić, 2018).", "Many of these trends that were already in course since the publication of the IOC's Agenda 2020 in 2014, still end up being part of a greater transformation undergoing in the world, as they also demonstrate alignment with the United Nations' sustainable development goals for 2030. Such needed discussions end up gaining even m ore relevance in a world that for a few years will still carry the impacts of the political and economic crisis left by COVID -19, which ended up restricting even more the resources for large -scale projects such as the Olympic Games, that who always had thi s difficulty in raising funds (Zarnowski, 1993). As the main result of this stage of the work, 5 suggestions of research were also proposed in order to understand each of the identified", "trends, being them: (1) Explore the sustainability of the Olympic Game s in its broadest sense, including not only environmental issues, but also the economic and social aspects ; (2) Understand the importance and how the rationalization of Olympic project expenditures will impact the sustainability of the Olympic cycles in th e medium and long term; (3) Investigate alternative legacy management methodologies to justify the high Olympic investment, balancing the benefits brought by the event ; (4) Analyze the possibilities of combined Olympic candidacies as a way to make the even t more accessible, dividing costs and risks between locations ; and (5) Understand how the digital transformation experienced in the world with the intensive use of technology in sport will affect the model of the Olympic Games and other mega sporting event s in the future .", "Figure 3 – Treats and trends of the Olympic Movement", "Source: prepared by the author", "2. Conclusion", "It is expected that the results of this work can help in the decision -making process of countries, cities, organizers and companies regarding the direct investments made in regions and industries living under the context of the Olympic Games. Due to the preparation time required to host an Olympics, and its cyclical characteristic of occurring every two years if we consider the historical alternation that has been taking place Public Security Political and Institutional SecurityHealth Security Olympic Games Trends for the Future Expense RationalizationLegacy ManagementProject Sustainability Geographic PermeabilityDigital TransformationNatural IssuesInformation Technology Security Gigantism", "between the Summer and Winter Games since 1924, there will always be governments and companies from somewhere in the world investing in an Olympic agenda. Thus, many possibilities emerge, above all for the Olympic cities of the future to rethink their projects, precisely because of the possibility of observing different variables broug ht by this work – including risks to be avoided and opportunities to be maximized – which deserves special attention in the event planning phase.", "With the editions of mega sporting events that took place in the “South Hemisphere” (Santos, 2019), especially from the beginning of the 21st century, it is possible that for the coming years we will continue to observe this alternation between north and south, more or less developed host countries, and together with that all the challenges imposed by the institut ional structures’ characteristics of each of these regions (Cuervo -Cazurra, 2016) . Whether for Beijing (2022), Paris (2024), Milan (2026), Los Angeles (2028), Brisbane (2032) or the other cities that will come after them, the challenges are posed and they will not be few, mainly due to the increase of the operational and financial complexity that the Olympic Games have experienced over their last editions (Agha et al., 2012).", "The growth in the number of sports modalities and international spectators has caused increasing demands for cities and companies in search of positive legacies, whether for their businesses or for their destination image. However, the need for infrastructure and each time larger investments has generated, in addition to the difficulty of financing, the disapproval of societies that are more critic about the real benefits of hosting a mega event (Hall, 1994) . Are these benefits justifiable to the point of the country giving up from other internal social agendas? Although it is still not possible to answer this question at this point, the reality is that events that were once the most desired projects in the world, recently have suffered from a growing disinterest due to their latest capacity of bringing more negative than positive legacie s (Pappa & Bruckner, 2015). This new dynamic that has taken over the Olympic agenda in recent years may in part justify cities like Brisbane as the host of an Olympics, whose election was held after an unprecedented single application. It is important to m ention that this cannot be understood as an isolated event, since in the BID for the 2024 Games there was a massive withdrawal of candidacies due to internal social pressures as in the case of Boston, Budapest, Hamburg and Rome. With no candidates for the 2028 Games, the solution found by the IOC was to distribute the next two editions among the only two remaining candidates Paris and Los Angeles.", "It is also important to remember that episodes like this have not been restricted to the Summer Olympic Games, and are also beginning to threaten winter editions and other mega sporting events (Bernardi, 2017). Seeing the unsustainability of the model in the medium and long -term, the publication of the 2020 and 2020+5 Agendas by the IOC in 2014 and 2021, respective ly, can be understood as a signal to future organizers and interested parties to change the direction of the Olympic movement towards a most inclusive, digital and sustainable event (IOC, 2021). But despite the shift in the speech, the practical implicatio ns of the new agenda guidelines were still difficult to be seen in the Tokyo recent case – in part because of the additional challenges imposed by COVID - The three theoretical frameworks proposed through the research stages, although isolated help to un derstand (1) how the literature has been discussing over the years the issue of direct investment and the Olympic Games in different realities ; (2) how specific industry sectors such as tourism and hospitality have performed in terms of organic growth and investment during Olympic cycles ; or (3) how the sustainability issues have been incorporated into the new Olympic agenda, especially since the impact of the pandemic on the 2020 Tokyo Games , it is also important to observe the connection points and how th ese three models are integrated in order to better understand the main question of the research, which precisely concerns how the behavior of the local business environments living under the context of the Games can attract and maintain direct investments to the hosting regions.", "In this sense, while the first model (Figure 1) can be understood as a more embracing framework that was concerned with mapping the main flows and variables responsible for affecting investments in the context of the Games, through the identification of challenges and possible legacies of the dynamic, the second model (Figure 2) ended up focusing on one of these markets mapped as one of the main legacies left by the event. In this sense, the tourism sector was chosen as the starting point for model 2, which aimed to analyze the behavior of the hospitality industry in the context of the Rio 2016 Games. Thus, this step can be understood as a microenvironment or “magnifying glass” analysis, which aimed to expand and better focus on one o f the variables found by the previous model.", "Once again, it is possible to identify in model 3 (Figure 3) this same movement of \"approximation\", but this time not to observe the behavior of specific sectors of the industry as identified in the legacies co lumn of model 1, but to focus in one of the", "variables mapped in the group of main challenges to the Olympic Games as in the case of public health. It is worth to mention that this variable was identified in the model 1 even before the crisis brought by COV ID-19, demonstrating for us that issues related to the health safety of the event have always been present through its history (Dom Total, 2020). However, with all the additional challenges brought by the pandemic from the beginning of 2020, the variable g ains even more representation in the model in the middle of this new context.", "Although this “magnifying glass” movement was also used in model 3, unlike the previous model (2), it was not intended to make a microanalysis of the local sanitary environment, but to map all the structural transformations that were already in progress within the Olympic agenda and which had to be accelerated due to the COVID -19 crisis. Thus, as a proposal of model 3, the movement of approximation and the subsequent distancing fr om the research object of Tokyo 2020 could have been observed, so that not only the impacts for the edition could be verified, but also the challenges for the other Olympic cities of the future that, in a way or another, would be affected by the transforma tions brought by that inflection point that passed the Olympic Games. In order to better identify the movements of analysis performed, we now highlight in yellow in model 1 (Figure 1) the variables that received the “magnifying glass look” in models 2 and 3 subsequent.", "Thus, in this final stage of the work, it is important once again to draw attention to the conjunctural events of recent years that were decisive for contributing to the acceleration of structural changes in the Olympic movement, directly res ponsible for the way that investments in the context of the Games were thought. In this new moment, it is even more necessary to create a conscience in governments and companies to the issue of sustainability of the projects (Trendafilova et al ., 2018), which, mainly due to gigantism, has been one of the main barriers to the Olympic candidacies. In a world in crisis, especially after the COVID -19 pandemic that left political, economic and social consequences in all nations of the world, the avai lability of resources from countries and companies for the next Olympic editions tends to be even more restricted. With that, one of the biggest challenges for future organizers will be precisely to transform long -term intangible legacies to something more tangible and with short results, in a way that allows to bring to the hosting regions a better perception regarding the economic sustainability of the Olympic projects (Scheu et al., 2018)", "Figure 1 – The direct investment flows in big events context (Cha llenges & Opportunities)", "Source: prepared by the author", "The sustainability of the future projects then goes through the need for making the expenses more rational (Overmyer, 2017), through the use of existing infrastructures or even shared applications between different cities and countries, thus giving other directions to the gigantism in course (Chappelet, 2013). Alongside this, a better legacy management (Preuss, 2007) becomes one of the only ways to justify the billions of dollars invested in the Oly mpic agendas. The non -existing or even negative legacies of past editions has been another responsible for putting away candidates. In addition, we also draw attention to the digital transformation that is taking place not only in sport, but also around th e world (Xiao et al., 2017) . Due to the context of social isolation brought about by COVID -19, there was an acceleration of this phenomenon, which from tendency gradually turned into need. Thus, the sustainable development agenda became each time more to c onsider the capacity of events and businesses to replace the physical by the digital, through a concept of digital sustainability (Seele & Lock, 2017). In addition to this, it is important to maintain the notion over the relevance the discussion involving emerging and developed regions, since, depending on where the event takes place, risks and opportunities commonly characteristic of these groups of countries tend to be maximized.

Through the work, it was possible to verify that mainly motivated by the presence of these mega events, local governments have been more inclined to implement tax and regulatory incentive pol icies (Silva -Rêgo, & Figueira, 2019), in order to create specific location advantages (Dunning, 1988), capable of making the local business environment more favorable and attractive to investments, especially international ones. These government incentives would act in order to reduce institutional distances perceived by investors (Kostova, 1999), by making the origin and destination markets closer.", "This practice, historically widely used in emerging regions (Weiss, 2012), is partly justified by the need fo r these markets to counterbalance their characteristic institutional fragility. Like in the case of Rio de Janeiro in 2016, as a way to stimulate the local hospitality industry – seen as one of the project's weaknesses due to its low supply and level of se rvice – the government of Rio de Janeiro ended up using a series of regulatory and tax incentives that became the main driver of investments in the sector during the period (Rio Negócios, 2016). However, some authors such as Tavares -Lehmann (2016), have al ready called attention to the unsustainability of these practices in the medium - term, since living in an economy of incentives can be very harmful to the local business environment in the long term. Thus, with the rupture of the incentive policies, togethe r with the lack of a post -event planning and the rapid increase in supply offer in the years leading up to the 2016 Games, they ended up causing one of the biggest crises that the city of Rio de Janeiro and its hospitality industry had ever experienced.", "Still from the firm's point of view, Montiel et al., (2021), also draw attention to the responsibility of companies in their ability to affect the way in which the local business environment is structured. For the authors, investments by companies, especia lly multinationals, would be one of the main factors responsible for increasing local", "competitiveness, thus exposing externalities characteristic of the region that could positively or negatively affect the local business environment and the way the market is organized. In this sense, there would be a growing need to reflect on the sustainability of investments not only at the country level, but also at the firm level. Even so, although it is possible to identify in recent years a growing importance of the sustainable development agenda also within the companies (Maksimov, Wang, & Yan, 2019), through Environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) actions, there is still a long way to cover in order to make international investments really sustainable a nd not harmful to markets.", "As a way for these organizations to plan their investments in a more sustainable way, it becomes essential to observe the institutional characteristics of the regions in which their businesses are located, considering that the co ncepts of peace, justice and strong institutions are also present as one of the United Nations Agenda 2030 sustainable development goals (United Nations, 2015). Due to the fact that developed and emerging countries have historically presented different ins titutional structures (Anderson & Sutherland, 2015), with their own advantages and disadvantages, it would also be necessary to reflect on the institutional variable as something that determines the long - term sustainability of firms’ investments, since the favorable environment created by incentive policies and the market speculation brought by the events tend to be temporary, while direct investments would need more solid and long term foundations.", "Therefore, it is important that companies living in the co ntext of mega sporting events become, in the future, aware of the variables responsible for influencing the industry or the business environment in which they operate. Much more than creating a transitory attractive environment, companies and governments m ust cooperate so that could be really possible to promote long -term planning initiatives capable of generating positive legacies for the future of businesses and societies. In this sense, there need to be a transformation in the way of thinking and plannin g mega -events, giving more importance to the post -event period, historically neglected by organizers (Agha et al., 2012). But break down a structure that over the decades was responsible for reaffirming that the next, and never the previous edition, will a lways be the most important one, certainly still impose several challenges to the various stakeholders that will be affected by mega -events in the future.", "3. Research limitations", "For mostly being a qualitative empirical study, this work was limited to i ts number of respondents – 38 through the different papers. Furthermore, because some of the facts analyzed are happening at the current time, it was not possible to verify the medium and long -term consequences of the phenomena. In addition to these issues , other difficulties already identified by other authors (Preuss, 2015), such as the accuracy of the years that the Olympic Games impacts starts and ends was also felt. A better understanding of this phenomenon is necessary above all in the post -event, in order to be able to better assess the impact, positive or not, of possible legacies left by it. We believe that the horizon of just 5 years that was possible to observe after the 2016 Games is still very limited, as its repercussions may even take decades to emerge, as in the case of the intangible legacies left in the destination image of Barcelona after 1992. In the case of Tokyo, for example, this post -evaluation was not even possible to be made.", "Another important limitation of the research was the diff icult in precising the origin of capital responsible for financing constructions projects and business expansions in the context of the Olympic Games. Although we understand that there is a relationship that leads to a different perception of risk between local and foreign investors, especially with regard to local political and institutional risk, it was not possible to specify the strength of this dynamic. This final limitation is justified since in the case of Rio de Janeiro was found that most of the br ands visited, whether national or foreign, had the inclination to operate through licensing or administration contracts, making more difficult the identification of the real responsible for the capital invest ed in the projects. Once again, the Tokyo case , due its broader view and scope, did not necessarily contributed for the comprehension of this relation between risk taking x capital origin.", "4. Future studies", "In order to better understand the behavior of the local business environment in attracting di rect investment in the context of the Olympic Games, a large horizon of possibilities emerges, above all in terms of applying the proposed models in new Olympic contexts. In this way, observe the behavior of trends highlighted in the work such as the issue of sustainability of Olympic projects (Mol, 2010; Trendafilova et al ., 2018; Barroghi et al., 2018), as well as their tangible, intangible, legacy expectations of short and long term (Cashman, 2002; Preuss, 2007; Scheu et al., 2019), combined with the question of how digitization has impacted not only sport competitions but the social", "dynamics of the world as a whole (Xiao et al., 2007 ; Dugalić 2018; Seele & Lock 2017), opens great research possibilities to observe the following Olympic project like Beijing (2022), Paris (2024), Milan (2026), Los Angeles (2028), Brisbane (2032), or the others that will come after these.", "Alongside this, some research possib ilities also emerge to better understand the impact of the health issue on the future of international mega sporting events (Ludvigsen & Hayton, 2020), mainly due to the limitations imposed by the timeframe of analysis observed by the 3rd step of this work like in case of Tokyo 2020. Therefore, it is also worth reflecting on a better understanding of the time in which possible legacies may emerge in the Games former hosting localities (Preuss, 2015). The creation of a methodology capable of delimitate the s cope of these legacies would certainly bring great gains for a better interpretation of the impacts brought by mega -events in cities and host countries.", "Finally, the observation of the behavior of industries highlighted as most impacted by the Games, in fu ture Olympics (Proni et al ., 2008), as well as the identification of the characteristics and origins of the capital responsible for the transformation of these industries ( section 3 ), certainly would bring great advances not only for the scientific communi ty, but also for companies in their process of risk perception and decision -making over long -term equity investments (Dunning, 1980; 1988), especially in the context of the Olympic Games.", "References", "Adams, L., Regibeau, P., & Rockett , K.

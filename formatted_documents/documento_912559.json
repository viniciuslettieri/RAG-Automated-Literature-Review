Landfill leachate treatment by ozonation and membrane separation processes. Advisors: Fabiana Valeria da Fonseca, D.Sc. / Juacyara Carbonelli Campos, D.Sc. Rio de Janeiro: School of chemistry / UFRJ, 2021.", "Leachate from municipal solid waste landfills is a complex mixture of organic and inorganic compounds, and it may cause serious damage to the environment due to its high concentration of recalcitrant organic matter and toxicity. The physicochemical and biological characteristics of leachate depend directly on the type, age and operation of the landfill, as well as weather conditions and the nature of waste disposed on it. Therefore, finding the most appropriate treatment to this wastewater is a challenging task and a frequent research topic by scientific community. Over time, landfills tend to produce leachate that is richer in recalcitrant organic compounds, which makes it less susceptible to the usually applied biological processes. This phenomenon, associated with the ever- stricter environmental laws, creates a demand for novel methods for treating this effluent. In this scenario, membrane separation processes, especially reverse osmosis (RO), are of great value, but they face a major drawback with the decrease of permeate flux over operational time, mainly due to fouling. In this thesis, treatment technologies were evaluated as pretreatment options to RO for treating recalcitrant landfill leachates. Initially, batch ozonation was performed to assess its efficacy as a single-step pretreatment to RO. Leachate samples from two different landfills were collected and characterized. The modified fouling index (MFI) was used to estimate the fouling potential of raw and ozonated leachates. A response surface experimental design was applied to optimize operational pH and ozone dose. The results demonstrate that the best operational conditions were 1.5 g/L of O 3 at pH 12.0 and 1.5 g/L of O 3 at pH 9.0 for Landfills 1 and 2, which reduced MFI by 96.22% and 94.08%, respectively. In addition, a significant ecotoxicity reduction was observed for both samples. These results, along with the similar behavior shown for leachate samples from distinct landfills, suggest that ozonation is a promising technology to fit this kind of wastewater into the requirements of RO, enabling their use in such treatment. However, ozonation would hardly satisfy the RO requirements to be used as a single-step pretreatment. The use of microfiltration (MF) along with the ozonation step would be useful to minimize O 3 demand and to reduce even more the fouling potential of this wastewater. So, new leachate samples were submitted to different combinations between ozonation and MF in order to improve the proposed pretreatment to RO. The MFI was, once again, used to estimate the fouling potential of raw and pretreated leachates. The results demonstrate that ozonation step followed by MF step represents the best layout, being able to reduce the leachate’s MFI over 170,000 times. The whole treatment (O 3 + MF + RO) is capable of fitting the landfill leachate to the local standards in force for discharge in freshwater bodies. Additionally, it was possible to notice the benefits of using ozonation prior to the MF step when compared to the opposite order, both because of the smaller MFI value obtained (19.53 s/L² instead of 5.10x103 s/L²) and also for the improvement in permeate flux during MF step. Finally, the RO permeate fluxes over 6.5 hours of operation suggest that the established pretreatment route is capable of overcoming the operational difficulties presented by this type of membrane when applied in the treatment of a wastewater as complex as leachate.

It also points out the main and the specific objectives of it as a complete work and highlights its novelty and contribution for the research field.", "1.1. Contextualization", "The current growth rates in industrial activities, in human consumption of disposable goods, in urbanization processes and in the population number in the cities results in an increase of waste generation, which may cause the pollution of soil, water and air. The environmentally adequate destination of such waste includes its reuse, recycle, composting, energy recovery and, finally, proper disposal on the soil. For the discharge of municipal solid waste (MSW), one of the most feasible options is landfill. Landfill is a method of final disposal of solid waste that presents minimal harm the environment, does not lead to diseases and offers minimal risks to public health and safety. There, MSW are confined in the smallest possible area, in order to reduce their volume to a minimum. Then, they are covered with a layer of soil at the end of each waste disposal journey or whenever it is necessary. When compared with other solid waste treatments, like incineration, composting and pyrolysis, landfill is the one that presents lower operational cost. Furthermore, even in the cases where other treatment alternatives are economically feasible, there is still the need of a landfill for the disposal of the rejects from such treatment.", "This technique, however, generates by-products (such as biogas and leachate) that must be collected and properly treated in order to ensure landfill’s environmental safety. Landfill leachate presents elevated polluting potential, which is why it needs to be properly collected and treated in order to ensure the landfill’s environmental safety. Additionally, this effluent shows high complexity and great diversity in its composition, which may vary with the type of waste deposited, landfill’s age, type of soil, waste compaction degree, etc. Therefore, finding the most appropriate treatment to this wastewater is a challenging task and a frequent research topic for the scientific community.", "Usually, a combination of physicochemical processes and biological treatments is applied for leachate treatment. However, landfill’s aging promotes the generation of leachate that is richer in recalcitrant organic matter, which leads to low efficiencies of biological treatments. This phenomenon, associated with the ever-stricter environmental laws, creates a demand for novel treatment methods of this effluent. In this scenario, membrane separation processes (MSP) are of great value.", "Most MSP processes work similarly to the conventional filtration processes, where a selective barrier is permeated by some compounds in the permeating fluid while others are retained by the barrier, concentrating in the solution. However, they differ from plain filtration in their selective matrices, since they present pore sizes much smaller than the ones from classic filtration or even no pores at all, which is the case of reverse osmosis (RO), which makes them more selective. Among MSP types, reverse osmosis (RO) stands out as a process in which dense membranes are used, allowing the permeation of just water, practically, and retaining most organic and inorganic pollutants in the liquid sample.", "The enhanced selectivity of RO membranes makes them a very attractive technology to be applied in the treatment of wastewaters of complex composition, such as landfill leachate. Nonetheless, the same composition complexity produces a great operational drawback for RO membranes, which is the permeate flux reduction over operational time, causing a need for constant operational stops for membrane cleaning or modules replacement, increasing the process’ costs. The most effective method to overcome the issue of permeate flux drop is the use of appropriate pretreatments. Among the many possibilities, advanced oxidation processes (AOP) is considered an interesting option.", "AOP encompass the processes that non-selectively oxidize organic matter. It takes place through the action of free radicals generated inside the liquid bulk during the process itself, especially hydroxyl radicals (•OH), which present high oxidative potential. AOP stand out among wastewater treatments due to their elevated efficiency in the degradation of recalcitrant organic matter, making them a suitable option for the leachate of old landfills. It may be highlighted, among AOP, the Fenton process (H 2O2 in the presence of ferrous ions), H 2O2 combined with ultraviolet radiation (UV), and ozonation, which uses ozone molecules, associated or not with H 2O2 and UV, to produce hydroxyl radicals. The main advantage of ozonation compared with other pretreatment methods is that it is a destructive method and it does not generate a residual phase to be disposed, like Fenton process or MSP. Also, in addition to hydroxyl radicals, there is ozone’s direct oxidation, which presents elevated oxidation power as well.", "1.2. Objectives", "The main objective of this thesis is to combine AOP and MSP techniques in order to produce an alternative treatment route to the biological processes (usually applied in the treatment of landfill leachate) that is effective for recalcitrant leachate samples. The focus is on the evaluation of combined pretreatments that mitigate the harmful effects of leachate on reverse osmosis membranes, improving the permeate flux and reducing the costs associated with membrane’s cleaning and modules replacement. Some specific goals are:", " To evaluate the efficacy of ozonation as a single-step pretreatment for reverse osmosis;  To study the impacts of ozonation’s operational parameters on leachate’s quality;  To establish the best configuration for the combination between ozonation and microfiltration as pretreatments;  To assess the treatment’s performance according to the physicochemical and the ecotoxicological qualities of leachate.", "1.3. Thesis structure", "This thesis is divided in five chapters, where Chapter 1 summarizes the work’s introduction, objectives, novelty and contributions. Chapter 2 displays an extensive Literature review, where the subjects of the thesis are thoroughly discussed, along with an overview of the published works concerning landfill leachate treatment and the use of technologies to overcome fouling on reverse osmosis membranes. Chapter 3 presents the evaluation of ozonation as a single-step pretreatment to mitigate the fouling potential of leachate samples from two distinct landfills. In Chapter 4, different layouts of ozonation process and submerged microfiltration were evaluated as fouling-reducing pretreatments for reverse osmosis in the treatment of landfill leachate. Finally, Chapter 5 brings the final considerations of the thesis, with overall conclusions and suggestions for future research.", "1.4. Novelty and contribution", "The conceptualization and operation of an efficient treatment process for landfill leachate is a challenging task. It is important to highlight that most technologies currently employed in Brazilian landfills present difficulties to make leachate meet the requirements of local environmental agencies. Reverse osmosis is a promising option to clean wastewaters of such complex compositions, but the decrease in permeate flux over operational time may make it unfeasible. It is expected that the combination of ozonation and microfiltration will present great potential to fit landfill leachate to the appropriate conditions for permeation in reverse osmosis membranes.", "Some works in the literature report the use of these technologies in the treatment of complex wastewaters, however, few of them report combinations between these methods in different route configurations in order to fit such effluents to discharge parameters, especially in the case of landfill leachate. Additionally, in the specialized literature, no work has reported the use of ozonation as an effective pretreatment to reverse osmosis when treating landfill leachate.", "Moreover, advanced wastewater treatment techniques are usually applied as the final treatment step (polishing step), not as its first stages. This thesis focused on the direct impact of advanced techniques (ozonation and microfiltration) as pretreatments on the operation of the final RO step. Its results may elucidate the real need of so-called primary treatments for the quality of discharged leachate. Finally, when assessing the impacts of new treatment methods, most works use synthetic solutions as wastewater. This thesis evaluates the treatment applied to real landfill leachate samples.", "Chapter 2.

It gives fundamentals of the processes, acting as a groundwork for all the experiments and discussion ahead.

Landfill leachate", "2.1.1. Leachate generation", "The degradation of organic and inorganic compounds in municipal solid waste (MSW) is a phenomenon that congregates biological and physicochemical mechanisms which are catalyzed by water, including the one from waste moisture and the one that infiltrates the landfill through rain or recirculation [1,2]. Such mechanisms are able to transform MSW by the action of microorganisms that are naturally present in the waste, such as bacteria, methanogenic archaea, fungus, protozoa and algae, and the compounds that result from this degradation are partially solubilized by water [3,4]. Leachate is the product of this degradation mixed with the water that percolates the waste pile. Leachate is also known as slurry or percolate, and it is composed of a mixture of easily, moderately and hardly degradable substances, as well as non-degradable ones, whose contents vary with the social, economic, cultural, geographical and climatic factors of landfill’s area [5]. The decomposition of waste occurs mainly due to anaerobic microbial activity, which is a complex biochemical process of several sequential reactions, each one with its own specific microbial population [6]. The stabilization of solid waste in the landfills may be described by five distinct phases, illustrated in Figure 2.1 and discussed separately.", "Figure 2.1. Stabilization phases of municipal solid waste in landfills. Source: adapted from Pohland & Harper [7] apud Moravia [6].", "According to the authors, each phase presents its own defined features that are explained ahead:", "1. Initial adjustment phase (Phase I) – It corresponds to the initial disposition of waste on the landfill, when moisture starts to accumulate in its interior. It is characterized by its short duration and by the presence of aerobic and facultative microorganisms. The biodegradable organic compounds start to be aerobically degraded.", "2. Transition phase (Phase II) – There is an environment transition from aerobic to anaerobic, with electron receivers changing from oxygen to nitrates and sulfates, substituting oxygen for carbon dioxide. Near the end of this phase, increases in chemical oxygen demand (COD) and volatile fatty acids content are observed in the leachate.", "3. Acidogenic phase (Phase III) – There is a significant increase in volatile fatty acids generation. Another typical behavior is the reduction of pH in the leachate, which enhances the solubility of inorganic compounds. There is also reductions of nitrogen and phosphorous contents, essential nutrients to microorganisms’ development, due to the growth of colonies of acid-producing microorganisms. 4. Fermentation phase (Phase IV) – Phase in which a consumption of acids by methanogenic archaea takes place, generating methane and carbon dioxide. Leachate’s COD decreases and the production of gas increases proportionally. pH value remains elevated due to the buffer capacity of bicarbonates, which, consequently, helps methanogenic archaea growth. The system’s redox potential is low and there is a significant consumption of nutrients, with sulfates and nitrates being reduced to sulfides and ammonia nitrogen, respectively. The metals are removed from the leachate by complexation and precipitation. 5. Final maturation phase (Phase V) – In the last phase, the low concentrations of substrate and nutrients become a limiting factor for microbial growth and its activity is severely reduced. The gas production decreases and the leachate presents low COD. Oxygen and oxidized species may reappear. The degradation of resistant organic matter may slowly occur, forming humic acids. At this phase, leachate’s pH tends to be more neutral (close to 7.0). The observation of more than one stabilization phase at the same time is quite common since the disposal of new waste loads is continuous in an active landfill, which makes it difficult to identify the waste degradation stage from the generated leachate’s features and makes its composition more complex [6,7].", "2.1.2. Leachate composition", "By and large, leachate can be characterized as an aqueous solution that contains a mixture of four main pollutant groups: dissolved organic matter (volatile fatty acids and more recalcitrant organic compounds, like fulvic and humic acids), inorganic macro components (Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+, K+, NH4+, Fe2+, Mn2+, Cl-, SO42-), heavy metals (Cd2+, Cr3+, Cu2+, Pb2+, Ni2+, Zn2+) and xenobiotic organic compounds from domestic and chemical waste, in low concentrations (aromatic hydrocarbons, phenols, pesticides, etc.) [8,9]. Leachate’s chemical and microbial composition is highly complex and variable since it depends on the characteristics of the disposed waste, on the environmental and climatic conditions of the landfill’s area, on its operation and, especially, on the decomposition processes that take place inside the cells [9,10]. By analyzing maturation phases, it is possible to notice that landfilling time exerts influence on leachate composition, reducing its polluting potential. Pohland & Harper [7] collected data about leachate’s characterization from several landfills and classified them according to the maturation stage of the respective landfill. Such data are compiled in Table 2.1, where a great variety of values can be observed. Table 2.1. Variation of leachate’s composition according to the maturation phase. Source: Adapted from Pohland & Harper [7]. Parameters Phase II Phase III Phase IV Phase V Volatile fatty acids", "Despite the difficulties of pointing out typical intervals for the composition of landfill leachate, some tendencies can be perceived in Table 2.1. For instance, COD and BOD (biochemical oxygen demand), as well as the BOD/COD ratio, tend to be more elevated in the leachate generate in young landfills. On the other hand, landfills may keep producing leachate for about 50 years after its deactivation [11]. At this time, the microbial action in waste degradation is almost exclusively methanogenic, there not being acetogenic microorganisms in expressive amounts [11].", "It is expected that deactivated or old landfills produce more recalcitrant leachate than the young ones, i.e., there is a higher concentration in the leachate of organic matter that is not susceptible to microbial degradation as maturation time goes by [12,13]. This increase in recalcitrance may be associated with the emergence of organic compounds of elevated molar mass, with complex structures and that often present few sites and functional groups that can be reactive with microbial action, which is the case of humic substances [14].", "Humic substances can be defined as a series of amorphous polymers of brownish to black color and relatively high molar mass [15]. They are formed from the oxidation and subsequent polymerization of organic matter during its decomposition process after its disposal in the environment [15]. They are found as a heterogeneous mixture of polydisperse molecules with diverse oxygen-based functional groups, such as carboxyls, phenolic hydroxyls and carbonyls [16]. These substances are the main responsible for the dark color usually found in landfill leachate [14].", "The main fractions in the mixture of humic substances are humic acids (HA), fulvic acids (FA) and humin (HU). The HA fraction is said to be soluble at alkaline solutions but insoluble at acidic environment (pH < 2), while FA fraction remains solubilized at any pH value after its solubilization at alkaline conditions, and HU are insoluble at any pH value [16]. Figures 2.2 and 2.3 illustrate molecular structures that were proposed for HA and FA, respectively.", "Figure 2.2. Bidimensional structure proposed for humic acids. Source: Schulten & Schnitzer [17].", "Figure 2.3. Bidimensional structure proposed for fulvic acids. Source: Schulten & Schnitzer [17].", "Silva [18] describes three reasons for the resistance of humic substances to microbial degradation: (i) their complex chemical structure may present few functional groups that are reactive with microbial action; (ii) their molecules may pose a toxic effect on the microorganisms or inactivate the enzymes responsible for the cell metabolism; (iii) Their molecules may form complexes with other chemical compounds that hampers the access of extracellular enzymes.", "Kang et al. [14] reported that leachate generated at a landfill in its methanogenic phase (phase IV – which was stipulated by the landfill’s age and leachate’s pH) presented 50 to 60% of its COD composed of humic substances. Lima et al. [19] studied the concentrations of humic substances in the leachate generated at Gramacho landfill (Rio de Janeiro Municipality, RJ), whose operations began in 1978, and in the one generated at Gericinó landfill (Rio de Janeiro Municipality, RJ), that began in 1987, both being, therefore, considered mature landfills. At the time of the study, the first landfill was completely deactivated while the latter was in the deactivation phase, receiving only waste from Civil Industry. The authors observed average humic substances concentrations of 1182 mg/L in Gramacho, whose COD was 1998 mgO 2/L, and 616 mg/L in Gericinó, whose COD was 1515 mgO 2/L. Although these two parameters are not evaluated in the same basis since COD is an indirect measure of organic matter content, it is possible to infer that humic substances represent a considerable part of organic matter content in the leachate of both landfills.", "The results of these studies show that humic substances participation in the composition of leachate is highly expressive, especially at older landfills. This observation leads to the need of a greater concern with the treatment of these wastewaters.", "2.1.3. Leachate treatment", "The treatment of landfill leachate is pointed out as the greatest challenge associated with landfill’s operation [20,21]. Historically, the same technologies usually applied for sewage treatment have been adopted to treat leachate since the last one represents a relatively new subject when compared to the previous one [4]. By the way, the dimensioning parameters usually applied for sewage are commonly used in the treatment of leachate, even though these two types of wastewater are essentially distinct, which frequently results in undersized treatment stations and low treatment efficiencies [4]. Following this logic, conventionally, the treatment systems for leachate in Brazil are based in biological processes, and, frequently, the sequential ponds’ system (anaerobic, facultative and maturation ponds) is employed to reduce the organic load in the leachate [22]. Such choice is also justified by the system’s usual low cost and ease of operation. Although biological processes are, indeed, a viable alternative for the treatment of leachate from young landfills, which probably presents high biodegradability, this is not necessarily true for mature landfills, whose leachate is more likely to present high recalcitrance and low dissolved oxygen content, resulting in low treatment efficiencies [4]. These inadequacies create the need to formulate new strategies to treat this type of wastewater, evaluating the best treatment option for each leachate [23,24]. In this scenario, the evaluation of treatment options for landfill leachate samples is a constant research topic amongst scientific community. A simple search using the advanced search tool in the core collection of Web of Science database using the command {ts=(“landfill leachate”)} returned 7,227 outputs for the period between 2006 and 2020.

Membrane separation processes (MSP)", "The first report of the permeation process happened in the XVIII century, when the permeation phenomenon of membranes from the bladder of the pork was described [68]. However, membrane separation processes (MSP) began to be used in water treatment due to need for improvements on water quality after World War II [68]. Nowadays, MSP is an established technology and it is extensively used to treat water and wastewater. MSP differ from the conventional filtration processes in their selective matrices, since they present pore sizes much smaller than the ones from classic filtration or even no pores at all, which is the case of reverse osmosis (RO). The main advantages of using MSP instead of other treatment processes are that these processes do not need the addition of chemical reagents and that no phase change takes place during treatment. The membrane is defined as a barrier that separates two phases and selectively allows or restricts the passage of chemical species [69].", "An important aspect about membranes is their structure and morphology. Membranes may be classified according to their structure as porous, dense or composite, and according to morphology as isotropic (symmetric) or anisotropic (asymmetric). Isotropic porous membranes have randomly distributed pores while isotropic dense membranes are composed of a dense film through which the permeate is transported by diffusion [68]. As for anisotropic membranes, they possess a superior layer that is tighter than the matrix of the membrane, which is called skin and can be porous or dense. The anisotropic membranes can be further classified as single-material, if skin and matrix are made of the same material, or composite, if a different material is used to form the skin over the matrix [69]. Figure 2.10 illustrates the different types of structure and morphology in the membranes.", "Figure 2.10. Classification of membranes according to their structure and morphology. Source: adapted from Baker [68].", "According to the material used in their compositions, membranes may be classified as natural or synthetic, neutral or electric charged, and organic (polymeric) or inorganic (ceramic or metallic). Organic membranes are more common since their production technology is well developed, which makes them effective, highly competitive and economical [69]. Inorganic membranes are also of great importance because, despite of their elevated costs, they generally present high durability and high resistance to elevated temperatures and aggressive environments [6].", "Most of MSP use pressure as the driving force that creates flux through the membrane. They usually encompass three characteristic streams: the feed stream, which is divided in two others in the membrane, the concentrate stream, which is the one retained by the membrane and richer in the less permeable chemical species, and the permeate stream, which is the one that passes through the membrane and is more diluted in terms of the less permeable chemical species [70]. Figure 2.11 illustrates the behavior of such streams.", "Figure 2.11. Streams involved in a typical membrane separation process.", "There are also membranes that operate submerged in the feed tank. In these cases, there are only feed and permeate streams, since the less permeable species, after being retained by the membrane, accumulate inside the tank, causing the concentrate solution to be retained inside the tank throughout the process [70]. Submerged membranes operate through negative pressure difference (vacuum in the permeate side). Figure 2.12 illustrates this type of process and its typical streams.", "Figure 2.12. Streams involved in a submerged membrane separation process.", "MSP operation may occur through dead-end or cross-flow filtration. In dead-end filtration, the feed stream flows towards the membrane surface and the retained particles accumulate on it. This is a transient state operation since the concentration of solutes in the vicinities of the membrane increases over time. In cross-flow filtration, the feed stream flows parallel to the membrane surface while permeate stream flows crosswise. This second operation mode helps prevent the accumulation of solutes on the membrane surface, producing a steady-state mass transfer operation [63]. Figure 2.13 describes the differences of both operation modes.", "Figure 2.13. Differences between dead-end and cross-flow filtration modes. Source: adapted from Habert et al.

The most used and commercialized processes are the ones that use pressure for that purpose, like microfiltration (MF), ultrafiltration (UF), nanofiltration (NF) and reverse osmosis (RO). Other types of driving force used in MSP are the difference in partial pressure, the difference in concentration and the difference in electric potential. When applied to wastewater treatment, the MSP that use pressure as driving force are the ones more industrially applied [71].

The disadvantages, on the other hand, are: (i) membrane lifespan can be short; (ii) low selectivity or low flux in some applications; and (iii) accentuated concentration polarization and fouling may occur.", "It is worth mentioning that membrane’s low selectivity can be perceived as an advantage in some applications, e.g., in the treatment of wastewaters that present a great variety of organic compounds in their compositions, which need to be removed from the water in a non-selective way.", "Concentration polarization and fouling are the main phenomena responsible for the permeate flux reduction over operational time in MSP. While the first one is a reversible effect, caused by the increase of solute’s concentration on the vicinities of the membrane, fouling is a partially or totally irreversible effect, caused by possible alterations on the membrane’s structure by deposition of solutes [69]. Fouling may cause permeate fluxes so diminished that it can make such application unfeasible [69]. Figure 2.15 illustrates the effects of concentration polarization and fouling on the behavior of permeate flux in", "Figure 2.15. Schematic variation of permeate flux over time caused by concentration polarization and fouling during membrane separation processes. Source: adapted from Habert et al. [69].", "Fouling is mainly caused by adsorption of molecules on the membrane surface or on the pore walls, pore clogging by molecules or suspended particles and deposition of suspended matter on the membrane’s surface [69]. Fouling effect should be taken into account in the evaluation of a MSP application since, as mentioned previously, it can reduce permeate flux so intensely that it impedes the process to be used. Therefore, it is crucial to evaluate the fouling effect of a particular liquid sample on membranes. A way of evaluating fouling effect is through the establishment of the modified fouling index (MFI), which in an index that describes the fouling capacity of a particular liquid sample. It was first described by Schippers and Verdouw [73] as an improved alternative to the silt density index (SDI), with the advantage of being proportional to the concentration of colloidal and suspended matters. Also, previous results have reported that SDI do not describe the fouling potential of landfill leachate as well as MFI, since SDI values of efficiently pretreated leachate samples did not change much while MFI values, indeed, reduced greatly [49].", "MFI is determined in a pressurized system, in which the sample percolates a microfiltration membrane at an established pressure. Then, the permeate volume must be gathered at regular time intervals in order to produce a chart of the inverse of filtration rate (t/V) as a function of the permeate volume (V). The MFI is graphically defined as the slope of the chart’s linear region and, the bigger the MFI value is, the greater is the fouling potential of the liquid. Figure 2.16 illustrates a typical MFI curve.", "Figure 2.16. Typical MFI curve.", "The evaluation of fouling indexes is very important for projects involving membrane systems. Wastewaters with excessive fouling indexes may cause irreversible depositions on the membranes, hampering the permeate flux and the performance of the filtration system as a whole. Wastewaters that contain biological and suspended matter can provoke severe fouling on membranes, especially on the more selective ones (NF and RO). A viable solution to overcome such matter is the use of pretreatments capable of fitting the fouling indexes of the liquid sample to the membrane’s specifications.", "2.2.1. Evaluation of membranes", "By and large, membranes can be evaluated through their rejection percentage, permeate flux and recuperation percentage. The rejection percentage to a specific solute, for instance, is a parameter that allows the assessment of the membrane’s selective ability and it can be calculated according to Equation 2.1.", "Where C F and C P represent the concentrations of said solute in the feed stream and on the permeate stream, respectively [69]. In batch systems, rejection percentage can be calculated using solute mass instead of solute concentration in both streams, which can be obtained by multiplying the concentration and the volume of each phase. As for recuperation percentage, it is defined as the ratio between permeate and feed flows (Equation 2.2). It is used to describe the filtration efficiency and is directly related to the potential of fouling formation [69].", "Where Q P is the permeate flow, and Q A is the feed flow. In batch systems, it can be calculated using permeate and feed’s volumes instead of flows. Membrane characterizations may also be performed through the variation of permeate flux with the applied differential pressure. The permeate flux for a pure solvent will be linearly dependent of the applied differential pressure if there is no membrane deformation (compaction), regardless of the type of membrane, as illustrated in Figure", "Figure 2.17. Influence of differential pressure on the permeate flux of pure solvent (water) in various types of membranes. Source: adapted from Habert et al.

The water permeability in RO membranes is around 10-2 m3 m-2 h-1 bar-1, while for MF membranes, it can reach 10 m3 m-2 h-1 bar-1, a difference of 3 orders of magnitude [69].", "Due to the retention of solutes by the membrane and its accumulation near its surface, the permeate flux of a solvent in a solution is smaller than the one of solvent in its pure form. The increase in transmembrane pressure by the presence of solutes intensifies this effect. A typical RO permeation can be observed in Figure 2.18, which illustrates the different permeate flux (J) behaviors between a solution and a pure solvent through an RO membrane.", "Figure 2.18.

Equation 2.3 quantitatively demonstrates the concept of reverse osmosis, where a minimum pressure must be applied on the membrane to overcome the increasing osmotic pressure and, therefore, ensure the existence of a permeate flux [69]. The fundamentals of reverse osmosis are further discussed in item 1.2.2.", "2.2.2. Fundamentals of reverse osmosis (RO)", "Reverse osmosis is an MSP usually applied when low molar mass solutes need to be retained, such as dissolved inorganic salts and small organic molecules (glucose, for instance). The name “reverse osmosis” is due to the fact that, in this type of process, the permeate flux occurs in the opposite direction of the osmotic flux [74]. Figure 2.19 illustrates an explanation of this process.", "Figure 2.19. Osmotic flux (a), osmotic balance (b) and reverse osmosis (c). Source: adapted from Habert et al. [69]", "When a semi-permeable membrane divides a solution from its solvent in its pure form, there is a flux of solvent toward the solution side (Figure 2.19a) because there is a difference in the chemical potentials of both sides. So, as the solutes cannot cross the membrane, part of the pure solvent trespasses the membrane in order to promote an equilibrium of chemical potentials of both sides. The differential pressure between solution and pure solvent is called osmotic differential pressure and, since there is no other driving force in the system, the osmotic pressure remains until the osmotic balance is achieved (Figure 2.19b), when a difference in the levels on both sides can be observed. Reverse osmosis takes place when pressure is applied on the solution side, forcing the creation of a solvent flux towards the pure solvent side, which breaks the osmotic balance and reverse the osmotic flux (Figure 2.19c) [68]. For that to happen, the applied pressure must be higher than the solution’s osmotic pressure [68].", "2.2.3. Reverse osmosis applied to the treatment of landfill leachate A search was performed in the Web of Science core collection to evaluate the number of articles about the use of reverse osmosis in the treatment of landfill leachate over the last fifteen years (2006-2020). The command {ts=(“reverse osmosis” OR RO) AND (landfill leachate)} was used in its advanced search tool. It returns 251 outputs, most of them after 2015. This suggests that this technology represents a recent alternative for the treatment of this type of wastewater and, thus, development in its application is still required.", "As presented in Table 2.2, Chamon [35], Peters [36] and Ushikoshi et al. [37] evaluated the use of RO membranes for the treatment of landfill leachate. Peters [36] tested the substitution of the usual biological treatments for RO and NF membranes and observed that both membranes were able to remove most pollutants in the leachate, despite their accentuated drop in permeate flux. As for Ushikoshi et al. [37], the authors studied the use of RO membranes for the removal of dioxins from the leachate of a landfill at Kanto, Japan, and focused their efforts on reporting that the system was capable of removing 99.9% of the chemical species in leachate, without making clear the drawbacks presented by their experiment. More recently, Chamon [35] evaluated the use of RO to treat leachate samples with distinct compositions and concluded that, despite generating permeates clean enough to be reused as a source of non-potable water, the permeate flux decrease over operational time made their use unfeasible for the treatment of most samples.", "Also, Rocha [60] compared the results for the treatment of leachate in a single-step RO membrane system with the ones for the treatment of the same leachate in a membrane bioreactor (MBR) followed by an RO system. The author reports that both treatment routes were able to fit the leachate samples into the European standards for wastewater discharge, but the pretreatment in MBR presented higher permeate flux and longer lifespan for the RO membrane.", "Renou et al. [59] assessed to use of lime coagulation followed by a prefiltration step as pretreatment for an RO membrane system treating leachate from a stabilized landfill. They observed that coagulation effectively reduced the leachate’s concentrations of carbonates and humic substances, which are responsible for fouling formation, resulting in much fewer changes of membrane modules and operation pauses for chemical cleaning.", "As for Singh et al. [61], the authors evaluated the effect of small ozone doses on the RO permeate flux when treating the leachate of three different stabilized landfills. They argued that, although ozone reduced the concentrations of several organic pollutants, it worsened the permeate fluxes when compared to their respective raw leachate. This observation would lead to the conclusion that ozonation do not represent an appropriate pretreatment method for this process. At the same time, this conclusion is debatable since the decrease in permeate flux is only presented in its normalized form according to their initial values, without any mention to their absolute values. The comparisons among all these works allow the affirmation that, as expected, RO is an effective method to treat landfill leachate in most cases, as these membranes are able to retain nearly all polluting chemical species, enabling the permeation of just water, practically. Nonetheless, the greatest concern with this technology, as demonstrated, is the accentuated decrease of permeate flux over operational time caused by the high fouling potential of this type of wastewater. The most recent research focus on the evaluation of pretreatments that minimize leachate’s fouling effects and, in this scenario, advanced technologies, such as advanced oxidation processes (AOP) or even the MSP themselves, may represent possible solutions.", "Finally, it is important to highlight that the final destination of the concentrates retained by the membrane, another important problem associated with the use of RO to treat wastewaters in general, may be performed in the case of landfill leachate by reintroducing it to the solid waste pile of the landfill. Besides being economically feasible, historically, this reintroduction has shown to be quite propitious, causing no additional harm to the landfill and no significant alterations in leachate composition [75], although it should still be considered in the long term.", "At the same time, according to the recently approved law #9055 of the State of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil [76], the re-introduction of residues from leachate treatment to the landfill of origin is allowed as long as it does not exceed 1/3 (in volume or mass) of the leachate generated by it. In this sense, destructive techniques, like ozonation, might be more valuable as a pretreatment to reverse osmosis then other methods, like coagulation/flocculation and Fenton process, since the first one does not generate residues that would add to the RO concentrate before recirculation.", "2.2.4. Fundamentals of submerged microfiltration", "Unlike what was presented for RO membranes, microfiltration (MF) membranes are composed of porous structures with average pore sizes between 0.1 and 10 μm, as displayed in Table 2.4. MF is largely efficient for the removal of suspended solids [34], present in leachate in relevant concentrations. This type of material, if not removed in previous treatment steps, may enhance RO’s concentration polarization and fouling effects (described in item 1.2), reducing permeate flux and membrane’s lifespan. It evidences the need of removing suspended solids in a previous treatment step, clearing the path for the use of MF as pretreatment for RO.", "As illustrated in Figure 2.12, submerged MF systems operate in batch mode with the membrane module immersed in a tank containing the wastewater to be treated, and a negative differential pressure, applied inside the module, allows the crossing of permeable compounds while components that are bigger than the pore size are retained by the membrane and accumulate inside the tank [70]. MF systems usually operate with aeration inside the tank to make the fluid stir in order to reduce the effects of concentration polarization of solutes in the vicinities of membrane surface, thus avoiding or reducing the decrease of permeate flux [63].", "2.2.5. Microfiltration as pretreatment to reverse osmosis", "MF membranes have been considered a good pretreatment method for RO processes since early evaluations [77,78], mainly due to their ability of retaining microorganisms and suspended solids, species that could greatly intensify fouling on RO membranes [79]. Ebrahim et al. [78] were able to reduce seawater’s fouling index from 6.50% to an average 2.24% by using a microfiltration step prior to reverse osmosis, which is in accordance with the observations of Chakravorty & Layson [77], who explained that the values of fouling index after microfiltration are usually lower than 3.00 when applied to seawater treatment.", "Herzberg et al. [80] attempted to reduce the biofouling on RO membranes by applying a prior microfiltration step when treating seawater. The authors observed that the pretreatment was able to enhance two to three times the RO permeate flux, while increasing salt rejection from 97.0% to 98.8%. They also reported much lower bacterial activities on the RO membrane surface that received previously microfiltered water when compared to the RO membrane that received raw seawater.", "Corral et al. [81] compared microfiltration and slow sand filtration as pretreatments to RO membranes used for desalinating water. The authors report that although sand filtration was able to produce suitable feed water for RO treatment, the microfiltration consistently provided water of better quality, which significantly improved the RO performance in the long-term. They also mention that the costs of both pretreatments are quite similar.", "All these studies highlight the great ability of microfiltration to remove suspended matter from the feed water, which is essential to reduce following on the later RO membranes, enhancing their lifespans. However, microfiltration could benefit from the association with other pretreatment methods that could reduce biofouling propensity, since microorganisms can cause permeate flux and selectivity reductions not only on RO membranes but on MF ones as well [79].", "2.2.6. Microfiltration applied to the treatment of landfill leachate", "A search was performed in the Web of Science core collection to evaluate the number of articles about the use of microfiltration in the treatment of landfill leachate over the last fifteen years (2006-2020), similarly to the one performed for reverse osmosis. The command {ts=(microfilt* OR MF) AND (landfill leachate)} was used in its advanced search tool. It returns only 52 outputs, indicating that these less selective membranes are not considered for this treatment as much as reverse osmosis. This is probably due to their inability to remove dissolved pollutants, commonly present in landfill leachate samples.", "Torres [63] used a submerged MF system to treat leachate from Gericinó landfill, in Rio de Janeiro. The author stated that, at their respective best operational conditions, submerged microfiltration was able to reduce only 16% of the leachate’s COD. However, she also verified that the turbidity was 99% reduced during the same process, which suggests the great capacity of MF to remove suspended matter from leachate. In the specialized literature, no other study reported the use of submerged systems to treat landfill leachate, but other works demonstrate that microfiltration itself is effective to remove suspended solids from this type of effluent.", "Moravia [6] used a continuous microfiltration system associated with a polishing nanofiltration step to treat leachate from the landfill of Belo Horizonte, in Minas Gerais State, that was previously submitted to an oxidation process by Fenton reaction. The author reports that the microfiltration step alone, when operating with an optimized differential pressure of 25kPa (0.25 bar), removed all total suspended solids (TSS) in the permeate stream from a feed stream containing an average concentration of 1535 mg/L. Pertile [34] evaluated several treatment techniques for the leachate of Caxias do Sul landfill, in Rio Grande do Sul State. She observed that the MF step, which operated with a differential pressure of 50 kPa (0.50 bar), reduced the leachate’s TSS from 200 mg/L to The evaluation of these works demonstrates that, by and large, microfiltration presents elevated efficiencies for suspended solids removal, a type of pollutant that severely aggravates fouling formation on RO membranes. MF, thus, detains the potential to act as a proper pretreatment for the treatment proposed in this work. Additionally, the association of MF with other pretreatment methods has been demonstrating great advantages for the whole process. Zielińska et al. [67] used ceramic MF and UF membranes to treat leachate from a stabilized landfill. Although only ultrafiltration was able to fit the leachate for discharge when applied as a single step, when these filtrations were associated with adsorption on activated carbon, not only the quality of the permeates from both membranes were equal, but MF permeate flux was actually higher than the UF one.", "Moravia et al. [56], Reis [57] and Torres [63] studied the association of Fenton reaction with microfiltration to treat mature landfill leachate, and all the works report significant improvements in the quality of permeate. Moravia et al. [56] and Torres [63] further investigated the viability of applying such combination as a pretreatment to high- pressure membranes (NF or RO) and both works recommend its use, which indicates that the combination of AOP and MSP can adequately treat this kind of wastewater.", "2.3. Advanced oxidation processes (AOP)", "Advanced oxidation processes (AOP) are defined as treatment processes that encompass the generation of ephemeral chemical species with high oxidation potential, among which, hydroxyl radicals (•OH). Besides their high oxidation potential (E0 = 2,8 V), these radicals also present low selectivity, enabling the transformation of a great variety of toxic compounds in relatively short periods [82,83]. In optimized conditions, AOP can mineralize most organic pollutants, converting them into carbon dioxide (CO 2), water and inorganic ions [84].", "Hydroxyl radical is one of the chemical species that may be produced with the highest oxidizing powers. Table 2.5 brings a comparison among redox potentials of different oxidizing species. Such potentials were all established in the same conditions", "Table 2.5.

Araujo [86] describes the hydroxyl radical attack to the organic matter in liquid samples through three distinct mechanisms: (i) reaction between hydroxyl radical and organic matter by hydrogen abstraction in the C-H bonds, generating organic radicals (R•) (Equation 2.4); (ii) electrons transfer reaction, in which hydroxyl radicals typically generate hydroxyl ions (HO-) (Equation 2.5); (iii) radical addition, in which hydroxyl radicals are added to the organic molecule through unsaturated sites, also generating organic radicals (Equation", "The secondary radicals generated by these reactions may react with other compounds, initiating a series of chain reactions that may completely mineralize all the organic matter contained in the wastewater radicals, or react with other radicals, ending the chain.", "In face of other treatment methods, AOP present, the advantage of not adding toxic compounds to the effluent, since the oxidizing agent (•OH) only exists in the aqueous medium during the oxidation process itself, being reduced to hydroxyl ions or neutralized by radical additions afterwards [85]. Another great advantage of AOP is the fact that they are destructive processes, i.e., the treatment does not happen by transferring the contaminants to other phases, but rather by degrading them through chemical reactions Most AOP combine a strong oxidizing agent (like hydrogen peroxide (H 2O2) or ozone (O 3)), catalysts (like transition metal ions and semiconductors like titanium dioxide (TiO2)) and radiation (like ultraviolet (UV) or electron beam) [85,88]. Table 2.6 lists and classifies the main AOP found in the literature. Table 2.6. Typical advanced oxidation process’ systems.

The application as a single-step is often limited to the degradation of pollutants in little contaminated water. In the cases of complex or highly polluted effluents, AOP are generally applied in combination with a previous treatment, in order to reduce the wastewater’s pollution level for the AOP step [85]. It may also be used along with a subsequent treatment, aiming at the partial oxidation of pollutants into biodegradable substances or into substances that are more easily eliminated by conventional physicochemical processes [85].", "Moravia [6] described some positive and negative aspects of using AOP in the treatment of wastewater. The positive ones are: (i) they do not act just transferring the contaminants to another phase; (ii) they may transform recalcitrant compounds into more biodegradable ones; (iii) they may completely mineralize certain contaminants; (iv) they often present lower energy costs than other treatments. The negative aspects are: (i) they may possibly form undesirable co-products; (ii) they may generate sludge (Fenton-based AOP); (iii) they may need elevated operational complexity.", "In the following item, ozonation’s particularities are discussed.", "2.3.1. Fundamentals of ozonation", "Ozonation has been being consistently applied in the treatment of water and wastewater since the latter years of the XX century, when it emerged as the main successor of chlorination process after the discovery of carcinogenic aspects of the last process’s co-products [89]. Ozone was discovered in 1840 by Christian Friedrich Schönbein [90] and it is a powerful oxidizing agent, as shown in Table 2.5. The decomposition of ozone leads to the formation of environmentally friendly products (O 2), besides being a highly unstable chemical compound (t 1/2 < 90 min. Depending on the environment, it can be shorter than one minute.) [91]. Therefore, it is fundamental that it is produced at the place where it will be used ( in situ production), reducing costs with transportation and storage [91]. As a result of its oxidizing potential, several applications of ozone are found in the literature, such as: water treatment for human consumption (disinfection, color and odor removal, degradation of contaminants), combustion of recalcitrant organic compounds, purification of industrial wastewater and discoloration of wood pulp [92–94].", "Ozonation is a chemical oxidation technique that uses ozone as oxidizing agent [95]. Ozonation process has been showing to be a very efficient alternative for the mineralization of pollutants or for their transformation into less complex compounds [84]. It may also be used to promote the oxidation of recalcitrant organic compounds, to increase its biodegradability, to remove color and odor or to reduce the production of excessive biological sludge [89].", "Since it is a gas reagent, when ozone is used for oxidizing liquid samples, it must be bubbled through the sample in order to keep the two phases (liquid in gaseous) in contact to promote the diffusion of ozone to the liquid medium and, thus, facilitate the oxidation reactions. In this context, it is very usual that this process takes place in semi- batch reactors, where the liquid sample is batch-fed while the gas reagent is continuously fed to it through diffusers that divide it in small bubbles. In industrial scale, the effluent feed stream may also occur as a continuous stream.", "Ozone can be produced from pure oxygen, from the oxygen in the air or from highly pure water [96]. Vera [91] mentions three possible ozone generation methods: (i) through an electrical discharge in dry air or pure oxygen, known as corona process; (ii) through the irradiation of O 2 molecules with UV light, known as photochemical process; (iii) through highly pure water electrolysis, known as electrochemical ozone production (EOP). Among these three methods, corona process is the most used in industrial scale and in laboratory experiments [62].", "Figure 2.20 represents a scheme of ozone production through corona process.", "Figure 2.20. Scheme of ozone generation through corona process. Source: adapted from Dezotti et al. [89]", "During the high voltage electrical discharge, some O 2 molecules decompose in their elemental constituents (Equation 2.7) and these generated oxygen atoms are incorporated by other O 2 molecules, forming ozone (Equation 2.8) [90,96]. By and large, ozone production from pure oxygen is twice as big as the one from dry air for the same amount of energy [96].", "Besides the concentration of oxygen molecules in the feeding gas, the ozonation process’ efficiency is extremely dependent of ozone transference from the gaseous to the liquid phase. In order to maximize mass transfer, several systems were developed aiming at the enhancement of the liquid/gas interface, either by reducing the ozone bubbles’ size through the action of air diffusers, which increases their superficial areas, by increasing turbulence through magnetic stirrers, or by using a contact column filled with some filling material, such as Raschig rings, among others [90].", "The knowledge of ozone decomposition mechanisms in aqueous solutions and its attacks to organic matter is of great importance for the proper use of ozonation process and for the development of new applications [90]. In spite of being the subject of study of several researchers [96–100], such mechanisms are not fully comprehended due to their complexity.", "Ozone molecules may directly attack the organic compound, which constitutes a direct reaction, or generate hydroxyl radicals, which are the ones that are attacking the organic compounds, also known as undirect reaction [95]. If ozone acts generating hydroxyl radicals, it is considered as a type of AOP. This is not the case if the oxidation is caused mainly by the ozone molecules themselves (direct reaction mechanism), which is also called ozonolysis [96]. The path that ozone takes in each process is influenced by many factors, such as temperature, pH and the nature of organic and inorganic compounds in the aqueous matrix [61].", "Usually, in acidic conditions (pH < 4) the direct reaction mechanism dominates while for alkaline conditions (pH > 10) the undirect reaction mechanism dominates, generating hydroxyl radicals [96]. It is admitted that in more neutral conditions, as the ones normally observed in superficial water and wastewater, both mechanisms (direct and undirect) co-exist and can be relevant for the process [96].", "Differently of what is observed for the undirect mechanism, in ozonolysis, the oxidation reactions are generally selective for aromatic and unsaturated compounds and tend to present slower kinetics [96]. In the direct oxidation, ozone molecules act as electrophilic agents, attacking preferably aromatic rings, causing them to open, which generates organic compounds of smaller carbon chains [90]. In unsaturated aliphatic compounds, molecular ozone attacks the double bond, breaking it and generating two separate new molecules [90]. Figure 2.21 exemplifies some oxidation reactions of organic matter by molecular ozone, the ozonolysis.", "Figure 2.21. Examples of ozone electrophilic attacks on organic compounds. Source: Gottschalk et al. [96]", "The indirect mechanism encompasses the production of hydroxyl radicals from ozone molecules, which later oxidizes organic pollutants as described in Equations 2.4 to 2.6. The generation of hydroxyl radicals happens in series of initiation, propagation and termination phases. Ribeiro [90] described the main reactions involved in each of these phases, and such description is summarized in this work. The initiation phase consists of the decomposition of ozone by initiating agents, such as hydroxyl ions (OH-). This is the reason why ozone-based AOP processes usually take place at alkaline pH. Other initiating agents may act instead of hydroxyl ions, which is further discussed ahead. The decomposition of ozone generates secondary oxidant species that react immediately and non-selectively with other molecules. The reaction between ozone and hydroxyl ion, for instance, forms a superoxide radical anion (O 2-•) and a hydroperoxyl radical (HO 2•), radical species that co-exist in equilibrium as shown in Equations 2.9 and 2.10. It is important to highlight that, at alkaline pH, the excessive hydroxyl ions shift the chemical equilibrium in the direction of superoxide radical formation.", "Then, propagation phase begins with superoxide radical anions (O 2-•) reacting with other ozone molecules to produce ozone radicals that immediately decompose to generate hydroxyl radicals through hydrogen trioxides (HO 3•), as described by Equations 2.11,", "Hydroxyl radicals may also react with ozone molecules, as described in Equations", "These are considered scavenging reactions, since excessive ozone molecules would compete with organic pollutants for the produced hydroxyl radicals, making it necessary to adjust the proper amount of ozone that has to be fed to each specific process. However, as these reactions ultimately produce hydroperoxyl radicals (HO 2•), the chain reactions of hydroxyl radicals’ production can restart from Equation 2.10. Therefore, excessive ozone would only slow down the kinetics of organic matter oxidation but not block it. Termination phase consists of the consumption of produced hydroxyl radicals by reacting with organic or inorganic compounds. Besides the desired oxidation of organic pollutants (Equations 2.4, 2.5 and 2.6), inhibitory substances may react with hydroxyl radicals, forming secondary radicals that do not produce superoxide radicals (O 2-• or HO2•), which stops the chain reactions. Equations 2.16 and 2.17 exemplify the scavenging reactions of hydroxyl radicals with carbonates and bicarbonates, respectively.", "Another possibility of ending the chain reactions is the reaction between two radicals. In this case, the unpaired electron of each radical is paired up again, as illustrated by the example of Equation 2.18.", "Thus, the molar balance of ozone’s indirect reaction mechanism (Equations 2.9 to 2.15) shows that each three ozone molecules produce two hydroxyl radicals (Equation", "As previously mentioned, during the undirect reaction mechanism of ozonation, ozone molecules produce hydroxyl radicals by the action of initiators. Besides free hydroxyl ions in an alkaline environment, other sources may act as initiators. Hydrogen peroxide (H 2O2), for instance, is one of these. The combination of ozone and hydrogen peroxide to generate hydroxyl radicals is called Peroxone process. Equations 2.20, 2.21 and 2.22 describe the initiation phase of such process [101].", "After this initiation, chain reactions continue as described in Equations 2.10 to 2.15, which provides the global reaction of hydroxyl radicals formation by Peroxone process presented in Equation 2.23.", "UV radiation is also capable of acting as initiator of ozonation process since it generates hydrogen peroxide from ozone and water (Equation 2.24), which can start the Peroxone process [74]. Additionally, UV light favors the direct dissociation of hydrogen peroxide into two hydroxyl radicals (Equation 2.25), which results in a global reaction for the ozone/UV process described in Equation 2.26 [74].", "When comparing the global reactions of these three distinct initiation methods (Equations 2.19, 2.23 and 2.26), it is clear that there is a better utilization of available ozone to produce radicals if UV light or hydrogen peroxide are added to the system. However, the choice of using these initiators must be cautious. UV light may be little effective in the case of dark or turbid wastewaters, which is often the case of leachate, since these characteristics may hamper the permeation of radiation through the liquid’s bulk [101]. Hydrogen peroxide, on the other hand, if excessively added, may act as a scavenger of hydroxyl radicals (Equation 2.27), slowing down the oxidation kinetics", "It is also important to highlight the importance of pH in any ozone-based oxidation process. While ozonation by itself is usually favored in alkaline conditions, Peroxone process tends to be favored in neutral conditions, since, at elevated pH values, hydrogen peroxide is easily decomposed in water and O 2, which depreciates its action in initiation the formation of hydroxyl radicals [22].", "As discussed, ozone-based oxidation may occur through different mechanisms and groups of reactions. Concerning wastewater treatments, landfill leachate in particular, the composition of contaminants is, by and large, unknown, not completely known or quite complex due to the great variety of compounds. When ozone is applied in this type of treatment, it may be virtually impossible to propose the reactional paths of oxidation that take place in the liquid’s bulk. In these cases, it might be more efficient to study the variations in the process’ parameters and how much they impact the quality of the treated wastewater. Some parameters that may meaningly impact the efficiency of organic matter oxidation by ozonation are listed and discussed ahead.", " pH:", "As previously mentioned, pH is the main responsible for guiding the oxidation mechanism of ozone (direct or indirect) [96]. Additionally, in Peroxone or ozone/UV processes, in which hydrogen peroxide exerts a major role in the formation of hydroxyl radicals, alkaline pH values may cause its decomposition into water and O 2, making it necessary to operate at more neutral values [22]. Thus, even if the oxidation reactions are not fully comprehended, adjusting the pH may provide the most appropriate oxidation mechanism for each specific wastewater.", " Ozone dose:", "Excessive ozone molecules may scavenge hydroxyl radicals (Equation 2.14), slowing down the oxidation kinetics. So, proper ozone dose must be investigated in order to avoid unbalancing the equilibrium of reactions.", " H2O2 concentration:", "As hydrogen peroxide may improve ozone use for the production of hydroxyl radicals but may also act as these radicals’ scavengers (Equation 2.27), it is important to evaluate not only its best initial concentration, but also if its presence or UV radiation presence is even necessary [101]. In some cases, hydroxyl radicals’ production may be favored if initiated just by hydroxyl ions in alkaline conditions.", " Mass transfer:", "Enhancing the interface between liquid and gaseous phases is highly important in ozonation processes in order to improve ozone transference from the gas stream to the wastewater [90]. The size of ozone bubbles and their residence time in the liquid bulk, which is directly related to the height of liquid column, should be perfected in order to facilitate the diffusion of ozone molecules to the wastewater and, thus, increase the process’ efficiency.", "2.3.2. Ozonation as pretreatment to reverse osmosis", "Ozonation has been effectively applied to reduce membrane fouling during surface and groundwater treatment. For instance, Brown et al. [103] studied ozonation as a pretreatment to improve the performance of an RO system used for treating synthetic surface water (pH = 7.0) and observed that a 0.30 mg/L ozone dose caused an increase in the RO permeate flux after 62.5 hours of operation when compared to raw water. Kim et al. [104] used a hybrid ozone/ultrafiltration system to treat natural waters (pH = 7.9) and reported that the permeate flux decayed only 15% with the use of ozone while it decayed around 60% and 55% in the same UF conditions with no gas dispersion and with oxygen bubbles instead of ozone, respectively.", "Karnik et al. [105] evaluated the effects of a dissolved ozone dose around 0.05 mg/L on the permeate flux of a nanocrystalline ceramic membrane used in the treatment of lake water (pH = 8.2) and observed that it decayed 11% with ozone while it decayed 24% with just oxygen, instead. Lee et al. [106] reported the use of an ozone dose of 0.1 mg of O 3 for each mg of suspended solid in the permeate flux of a microfiltration membrane used to treat sewage (average pH = 7.0) and observed slight improvements in the permeate flux over time.", "Overall, it is clear from these studies that ozonation is capable of reducing the concentrations of suspended and colloidal matter and, as a consequence, reducing the fouling potential of the liquid sample. However, it is crucial to highlight that most of these works evaluated the treatment of water, which is deeply less complex than landfill leachate. The partial oxidation of a complex water matrix, like leachate, may generate compounds that are more propense to cause fouling than the original ones and, therefore, ozonation’s efficiency for that purpose must be investigated.", "2.3.3. Ozonation applied to the treatment of landfill leachate", "A search was performed in the Web of Science core collection to evaluate the number of articles about the use of ozonation in the treatment of landfill leachate over the last fifteen years (2006-2020). The command {ts=(ozon* OR O3) AND (landfill leachate)} was used in its advanced search tool, resulting in 327 outputs. Just as observed for reverse osmosis, most of the articles were published after 2015, suggesting, once again, that this technology is a recent alternative for the treatment of this type of wastewater. Therefore, there is room for research and development.", "As presented in Table 2.2, Bila et al. [43] studied the influence of ozone on the biodegradability improvement of leachate from Gramacho landfill, in Rio de Janeiro, whose initial BOD/COD ratio was just 0.05, according to the authors. They attest that it was possible to increase this value to 0.30 through the use of 3 g of ozone for each liter of leachate to be treated. Tizaoui et al. [44] used ozonation and Peroxone processes to enhance the biodegradability of leachate from Jebel Chakir landfill, located in Tunisia. The authors report that the use of hydrogen peroxide allowed a two-time improvement in the efficiency of ozonation process, which also increased the leachate’s BOD/COD ratio Cortez et al. [52] investigated ozonation and Peroxone as the polishing step for a biologically treated leachate (i.e., rich in recalcitrant organic matter, which resisted to the biological treatment). The authors also report a greater efficiency of Peroxone process when compared with the more traditional ozonation, declaring that it was possible to increase leachate’s BOD/COD ratio from 0.01 to 0.17 and to reduce its COD in 63%. The same research group also investigated the use of Fenton reaction and ozone-based AOP as a pretreatment to biological processes in the treatment of mature landfill leachate [53]. In this second study, they observed that ozone-based processes were capable of elevating BOD/COD ratio from 0.01 to 0.24 while achieving 72% in COD reduction, which was considerably more efficient than Fenton reaction (BOD/COD increase from 0.01 to 0.15 and 46% of COD reduction).", "More recently, Wang et al. [65] evaluated the use of ozone to specifically remove humic substances from the concentrate streams of NF and RO processes applied in the treatment of landfill leachate. The authors affirm that the process was effective, being able to completely remove the humic acids fraction from both concentrates after 110 minutes of gas feeding. They also report that, although it was not enough for the concentrates to reach Chinese standards for wastewater discharge, there were considerable changes in their compositions and expressive reductions in their recalcitrance.", "Singh et al. [61] investigated the use of ozonation as the pretreatment step to RO in the treatment of leachate samples from three distinct landfills (pH = 7.5~7.9), all presenting recalcitrant nature (BOD/COD ratios between 0.02 and 0.12). All experiments run with an ozone concentration in the gas stream of 66.7 g of ozone for each cubic meter of gas and the authors report that, in the optimized ozonation conditions, the leachate samples absorbed 78% less radiation in 254 nm (Abs 254) and presented 23% less dissolved organic carbon than raw leachate. Nonetheless, as mentioned in item 1.2.3, the ozonated leachate samples showed lower permeate fluxes in the RO membrane than their respective raw samples, which would exclude ozonation as an adequate pretreatment option to RO, at least in the ozonation conditions evaluated by the authors. However, it is worth to point out, once again, that such observation is questionable, since the authors presented the permeate fluxes only in their normalized form in relation to their values at the beginning of permeation, not mentioning their absolute values. Additionally, it is important to keep in mind that leachate compositions may vary according to several factors, and, thus, this conclusion does not indicate that ozonation is not proper for pretreating landfill leachate prior to membranes in a more general sense.", "Through the analysis of all these works, it is possible to notice that, when ozonation is applied to the treatment of landfill leachate, it is almost exclusively used for recalcitrant leachate samples, i.e., this technique is currently considered for such treatment as an alternative to the usual biological processes. Additionally, most authors argue about the advantages of ozone to enhance leachate’s biodegradability, tacitly suggesting the use of a subsequent biological treatment step. These results allow the affirmation that ozonation process is able to provoke profound changes in the chemical composition of leachate, considerably reducing the concentration of recalcitrant compounds, which currently represent the biggest concern for the treatment of this type of effluent.", "2.4. Combinations of O 3, MF and RO", "The Web of Science database was used once again to return the articles available in the literature about the specific techniques applied as treatment in this thesis. The search commands {ts=(ozon* OR O3)}, {ts=(microfilt* OR MF)} and {ts=(“reverse osmosis” OR RO)} were used to find articles concerning ozonation, microfiltration and reverse osmosis, respectively. When these search commands were combined with articles published in the last fifteen years containing “leachate” in their titles, they returned the number of outputs as demonstrated in Figure 2.22.", "Figure 2.22. Research about ozonation (O3), microfiltration (MF) and reverse osmosis (RO) applied as treatment for leachate in the last fifteen years (2006-2020), according to the literature available in the Web of Science core collection.", "The numbers presented in Figure 2.22 suggest that ozonation and reverse osmosis are more interesting for the treatment of landfill leachate than microfiltration, probably due to the limitation of the last method of retaining suspended matter, mainly. Either way, combinations among these three methods to act as leachate treatment seem to be quite unusual. The advanced search tool returned 15 outputs for the combination of ozonation 212 O3 MF RO O3+RO MF+RO O3+MF O3+MF+RO and RO, 13 for the combination of MF and RO, 2 for the combination of ozonation and MF and only 1 article that presents a combination among the three methods. All these articles were carefully evaluated to verify how many of them are related to the scope of this thesis.", "Among the 13 articles returned for microfiltration and reverse osmosis (MF+RO), 6 of them use MF as a pretreatment step for RO, and only 2 out of these 6 applied the raw leachate directly on the microfiltration membrane [107,108]. It is a much more common configuration to couple MF with other pretreatment methods prior to RO membranes, especially biological treatments [109,110], chemical precipitation [109] or coagulation- flocculation [111,112]. This highlights the possible benefits of associating other pretreatment methods with MF to RO final treatment step. Additionally, no mention of ozonation process was found in these 13 articles, which is an evidence that the treatment configuration of this thesis has never been reported before.", "As for the 15 articles that combine ozone and RO (O3+RO) to treat leachate, it is clear from the analyses of their abstracts that the majority of configurations represent the use of ozonation as a treatment method for the concentrate stream of reverse osmosis, which differs from the proposed treatment in this thesis. In fact, only 2 articles among them evaluated the ozonation step as a pretreatment for reverse osmosis, one of them being the article described in this thesis’ chapter 3. The other one is exactly the one output for the combination of all three treatment methods (O3+MF+RO), which uses low doses of ozone (66.7 mg/L) as an attempt to reduce leachate’s fouling on high-pressure membranes (RO and NF) [61]. This article was thoroughly discussed in sections 2.2.3 and 2.3.3 and, in spite of returning as an output for the combination of all three methods used in this study, the authors did not mention microfiltration in any step of their research. The 2 outputs for the combination of ozonation and MF (O3+MF) correspond to this same article [61] and another one that used ozonation in small doses (60.0 mg/L) as a pretreatment to improve microfiltration performance when applied to a previously biologically treated leachate [113]. The authors report that ozonation presented the capacity of improving the MF membrane’s performance, which suggests that the same behavior could be observed for other membranes.", "All these searches indicate that the combination of ozonation, microfiltration and reverse osmosis is promising for the treatment of landfill leachate, but it still needs to be investigated since information about it in the literature is yet very scarce.", "2.5.

Leachate samples from two different landfills were collected and characterized. The modified fouling index (MFI) was used to estimate the fouling potential of raw and ozonated leachate samples. A response surface experimental design was applied to optimize operational pH and ozone dose. The results demonstrate ozonation’s great capacity to reduce leachate’s MFI and ecotoxicity. These results, along with the similar behavior shown for leachate samples from distinct landfills, suggest that ozonation is a promising technology to fit this kind of wastewater into the requirements of RO membranes, enabling their use in such treatment.", "A version of this chapter was published as a paper in Processes (IF: 2.753) in April 2020.", "E.

Introduction", "Landfill is the most used method for the treatment of municipal solid waste (MSW) worldwide [1]. However, the generation of by-products is inevitable during and after its operation. Landfill leachate is one of these undesirable by-products. It is a contaminated liquid that may cause serious environmental problems if not properly drained and treated. Such problems encompass the pollution of surface water and groundwater, which may directly affect the local population and biota [2–4]. It is generated from the microbiological degradation of organic matter contained in the solid waste and water that comes from both its natural moisture and rainwater that percolates the waste pile, infiltrating landfill inner layers [5,6].", "Leachate composition depends on many factors and its characteristics vary over time and from one place to another. Therefore, the choice of the most appropriate treatment for such wastewater is a challenging task in its management [7,8]. As it is composed by both suspended/colloidal and dissolved matters in large amounts, a combination of separation and destruction mechanisms is recommended for the efficient treatment of this mixture [9]. Many studies using physical, chemical and biological processes to treat leachate from the most diverse origins can be found in literature. Landfills’ aging promotes the generation of leachates that are richer in recalcitrant organic matter [10]. Associated to the strict environmental regulations, this phenomenon creates a demand for methods to treat such wastewater other than the usual biological processes [11,12]. In this context, the use of advanced technologies, such as Membrane Separation Processes (MSP), particularly Reverse Osmosis (RO), has shown potential to fit leachate to the discharge parameters or even to its reuse [13–15].", "According to Renou et al. [16], the RO membranes ability to retain both organic pollutants and inorganic salts makes such method able to properly treat complex wastewaters such as landfill leachate. However, Renou et al. [10] highlight that the greatest complication to MSP use is the decrease of permeate flux over operational time, which is attributed to accentuated concentration polarization and fouling. Whilst the first one is a reversible effect caused by the accumulation of solutes on membrane surface, fouling is a partially or totally irreversible effect caused by the interaction between solute and the membrane, either by deposition or pore blocking [17,18]. These phenomena may be responsible for permeate fluxes so diminished that the use of such membrane is not viable, especially with more restrictive membranes, like RO [19]. The authors also describe that, to overcome such matter, the utilization of advanced pretreatments like Advanced Oxidation Processes (AOP) is a possibility.", "AOP represent a group of processes that non-selectively oxidize organic matter by the action of free hydroxyl radicals (•OH). These radicals possess an elevated oxidative potential (E0 = 2.8 V) and are produced inside the liquid during the process itself [20]. AOP differ from other wastewater treatments by presenting high efficiencies of recalcitrant organic matter degradation [21], which makes this method indicated for the treatment of leachates that may not be very susceptible to biological treatments. Among AOP, one of the stand-outs is ozonation, which produces hydroxyl radicals by the action of a gas stream containing ozone that is fed to the wastewater [22]. The authors describe, as well, that an advantage of ozonation is that ozone itself may directly oxidize organic matter, since it also presents a high oxidative potential (E0 = 2.07 V). The direct oxidation of ozone is selective for unsaturated and aromatic organic compounds, which are very common in landfill leachate [14]. The mechanism of ozone oxidation (direct or indirect) is mainly guided by the pH of the sample, where an acidic environment favors the direct oxidation while an alkaline one favors the production of free radicals Ozonation has been effectively applied to reduce membrane fouling during surface and groundwater treatment. Brown et al. [23] used ozonation as pretreatment to improve the performance of a RO system used to treat synthetic surface water and observed that a 0.30 mg/L ozone dose caused increase in the RO permeate flux after 62.5 hours of operation when compared to raw water.

[24] used a hybrid O 3/ultrafiltration (UF) system to treat natural waters and reported that the permeate flux decayed only 15% with the use of ozone while it decayed around 60% and 55% in the same UF conditions with no gas dispersion and with oxygen bubbles instead of ozone, respectively. Karnik et al. [25] evaluated the effects of an ozone dose around 0.05mg/L on the permeate flux of a nanocrystalline ceramic membrane used in the treatment of lake water and observed that it decayed 11% with ozone and 24% with just oxygen, instead. Lee et al. [26] reported the use of an ozone dose of 0.1 mg of O 3 for each mg of suspended solid in the permeate flux of a microfiltration membrane used to treat sewage and observed slight improvements in the permeate flux over time.", "In this scenario, the goal of this Chapter is to evaluate the efficacy of ozonation process to work as a single-step pretreatment to RO membranes in the treatment of recalcitrant landfill leachate. It was assessed by means of the direct impact of ozonation on the reduction of fouling potential of leachates from two distinct sanitary landfills located on the metropolitan region of Rio de Janeiro State (Brazil), both presenting an elevated amount of recalcitrant organic matter. Response surface methodology was used as a statistical tool to help guide the choice of the best conditions to ozonation application before RO step. The modified fouling index (MFI) was used to estimate the fouling potential of raw and pretreated leachates. Toxicity tests were also performed to evaluate the impact of this process on the local biota. The findings of this work are expected to generate relevant information concerning the viability of this treatment option for landfill leachate worldwide.", "3.2. Material and methods", "3.2.1. Leachate samples", "For this Chapter, leachate samples were collected from the equalization ponds of two landfills located at the metropolitan region of Rio de Janeiro State (Brazil), henceforth named Landfill 1 and Landfill 2. The samples were stored refrigerated at temperature below 10°C.", "Landfill 1 started its operation in 2011 and was designed to operate for 20 years with an average waste deposition of 8,000 t/day. However, around 2016, it was already receiving around 10,000 t/day, which reduces its expected operation period to 15 years. This landfill represents the final destination of 80% of all municipal solid waste generated in Rio de Janeiro municipality and generates around 450 m³ of leachate daily. As for Landfill 2, it started its operation in 2012 and was designed to operate for at least 21 years with an average waste deposition of 1,500 t/day. This landfill generates around 100 m³ of leachate daily.", "3.2.2. Analytical methods", "The characterizations of raw leachates from both landfills, as well as the ones pretreated by ozonation at their respective chosen best conditions, were made through the following parameters (along with their analytical methods, according to APHA [27], and their equipment): Absorbance at 254 nm – Abs 254 (5910 B – Shimadzu UV mini 1240 and quartz cuvettes of 10 mm lightpath); Total alkalinity (2320 B – Automatic Burette Tritette Class A); Conductivity (2510 B – MS Tecnopon Instrumentação); True color (2120 C – Spectrophotometer DR2800 Hach and quartz cuvettes of 50 mm lightpath); Biochemical Oxygen Demand – BOD 5 (5210 B – Oximeter YSI); Chemical Oxygen Demand – COD (5220 D - Spectrophotometer DR2800 and reactor Hach); Ammonia nitrogen – N-NH 3 (4500-NH 3 E – Orion 4 star Thermo pH ISE portable); pH (4500-H+ B – pHmeter microprocessor Quimis); turbidity (2130 B – Turbidimeter: Poli Control-AP 2000). Acute ecotoxicity tests using Allivibrio fischeri , also known as Vibrio fischeri or Photobacterium phosphoreum , were also performed. As mentioned by Ghosh et al. [28], it is important to estimate the toxic potential before the discharge of any fluid on water bodies since some chemical compounds may be, individually or in combination, harmful to the biota even in small concentrations. Moreover, during AOP, the oxidation products generated can be even more toxic than the original contaminants [22], which makes such evaluation essential when this kind of treatment is applied to any wastewater. For acute ecotoxicity tests, it was used the methodology described in the Brazilian Standard NBR 15411-3 [29] in Microtox equipment (SDI, Analyzer model 500) with a lyophilized strain from Umwelt Biotecnologia Ambiental (Blumenau, Brazil).. Assays ran over 15 and 30 minutes and results were expressed in terms of EC50, i.e., the effective concentration of leachate in the dilution where a 50% reduction in luminescence is observed.", "As for the evaluation of ozonation efficacy, the modified fouling index (MFI) was used. MFI is an index that describes the fouling potential of a specific liquid sample during filtration processes. Although it is a mere indication of how fouling formation will behave during filtration in the actual membrane system, MFI allows the assessment of the fouling potential through the use of a very small liquid sample and disposable microfiltration membranes, which is good for the preservation of RO membrane since many permeation tests need to be performed. The index is assessed in a pressurized system where the liquid sample percolates a 0.45 µm (Millipore) membrane with 47 mm in diameter at pressure of 30 psi (2.07 bar) and at room temperature (25°C). Figure 3.1 illustrates the MFI unit scheme.", "Figure 3.1. Scheme of the MFI unit.", "A chart of the inverse of filtration rate (t/V) as a function of permeate stream volume (V) is plotted. MFI is defined as the slope of the chart’s straight region [30]. The steeper the slope, the bigger the capacity of the liquid to cause fouling. The establishment of fouling indexes, like MFI, is important for the design of treatment systems with membranes, mainly when dealing with Nanofiltration (NF) or RO. Wastewaters that present excessive indexes may cause irreversible deposition on the membrane, reducing the permeate stream flux and harming the process performance.", "3.2.3. Ozonation", "Ozonation tests were all performed in an ozonation unit with some adaptations for this particular treatment. Its effectiveness was calculated as the percentage of MFI reduction that the leachate presented immediately after ozonation calculated over the same index measured right before ozonation process. Ozonation unit is composed of an O 3 generator, an analyzer of O 3 concentration on the gas stream, a semi-continuous reactor (where leachate is batch fed before the unit’s start whilst gas stream is continuously fed), two O 3 destruction baths and an altered foam- collecting vessel, as well as all the hoses and manual valves necessary to ensure a proper gas flow through the unit. Figure 3.2 presents a scheme of such unit.", "Figure 3.2. Scheme of the ozonation unit.", "Before O 3 generation starts, the semi-continuous reactor was fed with the entire leachate sample to be ozonated and, then sealed. The sample had its pH previously adjusted to the value specified for each experiment with the help of a 50% w/w NaOH solution or, eventually, with commercial HCl solution (purity of 37%). Such solutions were this concentrated in order to minimize dilution effects in the sample. During operation, the unit is continuously fed with a gas stream containing 99.5% of O 2 at the gauge pressure of 62 kPa (9 psi) and with a fixed flow rate of 5 L/min (following instructions of the O 3 generator manufacturer), which flows into the generator. There, a strong electrical discharge (known as Corona discharge) produces O 3 from the O 2 molecules in the feeding gas stream.", "Usually, the unit operates with valve A1 open and valves A2 and A3 closed, so that the generator’s outlet gas stream, which contains O 2 and O 3, feeds the semi-continuous reactor at its bottom through a diffuser plate to divide it into small bubbles. To overcome reactor overflows caused by the foam generated during the contact of gas stream and leachate, initially, the use of commercial anti-foam suspensions was considered. Early experiments used very small anti-foam suspension volumes (2 droplets for each litter of leachate) in order to preserve the leachate’s original composition. However, these initial experiments showed that the addition of anti-foam suspensions to the leachate samples was responsible for MFI increases so massive that even their ozonated samples presented higher MFI values than the raw leachate itself, making the use of such suspension counterproductive for the purpose of ozonation application. These MFI curves are displayed in Supplementary Material A.", "Afterwards, a foam-collecting vessel was evaluated as a possible solution. It was an adaptation of what was described by Salla et al. [31], who used a vessel to separate foam and gas. In this work, to avoid leachate loss, a recycle line was plugged at the bottom of the foam-collecting vessel through which the collected foam can be re-introduced to the reactor after its regeneration to the liquid form at regular time intervals. The unit operates in an intermittent mode between gas feeding and recycles. The recycle works by closing A1 valve, which stops the gas stream feeding to the reactor, and opening A2 and A3 valves, which makes the gas stream go through by-pass line directly to the destruction baths, and the regenerated foam be re-introduced to the reactor.", "The O 3 analyzer is capable of continuously measuring O 3 concentrations in gas streams in terms of mg/L of gas by using small gas stream samples. In the unit, it is connected to the inlet line of the reactor and the outlet line of the foam-collecting vessel. Both connections are equipped with manual valves (B1 at the inlet and B2 at the outlet) to make the unit operate sending only one continuous gas stream sample at a time to the analyzer, enabling it to measure the amount of O 3 fed to the leachate or the amount not consumed by it. The dose of ozone is, then, calculated by the difference between these measurements, which represents the amount of ozone consumed by the leachate over the volume of leachate being treated.", "The process stops by ceasing the gas stream feeding. Leachate volumes and test conditions are specified for each test ahead.", "3.2.4. Response Surface methodology", "For each landfill leachate, an experimental design was made in order to produce a response surface. This design is a statistical tool to verify the influence of experimental parameters on an aimed response and also in which levels such parameters are better applied. It generates a mathematical model that suits the observed results in the best way possible and that expresses the expected response value of a test from the values applied for each evaluated parameter, making it possible to predict the response to be obtained [32]. The model is an equation that describes the regression of all experimental data to the surface that best fits them.", "The central composite design (CCD), which is used in this Chapter, is one type of response surface design, as it provides the possibility of suiting the observed data to a quadratic mathematical model to predict the response. If so, an estimation of which experimental conditions may maximize or minimize the response could be done. The mathematical models generated may be illustrated in response surfaces to enable the visualization of response peaks. CCD methodology establishes that, for an evaluation of two parameters in two different levels, 8 experiments are necessary (being 4 from the factorial analysis and 4 from the axial points) plus the replicates of the central point (which are 4 in this work), totalizing 12 experiments for each design. Both designs were made with the help of Design Expert 6.0.4 software and featured as evaluated response the MFI reduction (in terms of percentage calculated over the MFI of raw leachate). In the software, the amount and order of experiments are organized according to the parameters and levels to be studied and, after the insertion of experimental results, a statistical analysis generates the mathematical models that describe the response surface. The experimental parameters evaluated on both designs are:", "1. Leachate initial pH (from 8 to 12);", "2. O3 dose fed to the leachate (from 0.5 g/L to 1.5 g/L).", "The decision for these intervals was guided by results observed in preliminary tests made with a leachate sample from Landfill 1, which followed trial and error logic. In these tests, which are available in Supplementary Material B, it was observed that acidic operational pH values seemed to be less effective for leachate’s MFI reduction than alkaline ones. Also, these results suggested that the addition of hydrogen peroxide (H 2O2) worsened the process’ effectiveness when compared to plain ozonation, probably because this compound was acting as a scavenger for hydroxyl radicals rather than as a precursor for their production. Therefore, acidic operational pH and the possibility of addition of hydrogen peroxide were excluded from the experimental design.", "The pH range was established to encompass the leachate’s natural pH value (around 8) and more alkaline values (where hydroxyl radicals’ generation is favored). The O 3 dose range was established to encompass the minimum condition in which visual changes were observed in the leachate and an arbitrary 3-times-bigger condition.", "3.3. Results and discussion 3.3.1. Characterization of leachate samples Table 3.1 presents the characterization of leachate samples from both landfills.", "Table 3.1. Characterization of leachate samples from both landfills. Parameter Units Landfill 1a Landfill 2a Total alkalinity mg CaCO 3/L 13083 ± 325 14015 ± 373 aThe errors may refer to the standard deviations for the parameters where multiple measurements were performed (total alkalinity, BOD 5, COD, N-NH 3) or to the equipment uncertainty for the parameters where a single measurement was performed (pH, Abs 254, true color, turbidity and conductivity).", "First of all, it is important to observe that both leachates present similar and not very expressive BOD 5/COD ratios, which shows that, among their organic matter content, most chemical species are not biodegradable since they can be chemically oxidized but not biochemically oxidized. It indicates the presence of relevant concentrations of recalcitrant compounds among their organic loads, such as humic substances (humic and fulvic acids), which are commonly found in landfill leachate. Also, characterization results demonstrated that these samples possess overall similar compositions. Turbidity, however, is an exception, which is a parameter associated to the presence of suspended matter. Such difference reflects on the MFI values observed for both raw leachates, since MFI test takes place on a microfiltration membrane, which retains suspended matter, mainly. Therefore, it makes sense that the leachate that presents higher turbidity will also be the one to present higher MFI.", "Despite the great difference observed between these values of MFI, they are both very elevated, especially if taking into account some reference MFI values for the application of RO in water treatment: from 0 to 2.0 s/L2 [33] or from 0 to 1.0 s/L2 [34]. Such intervals are not a consensus amongst scientific community and are mainly recommended for water treatment, there being several applications of RO membranes to treat wastewaters with MFI values above these intervals. However, wastewaters with MFI as high as the ones evaluated will certainly cause accentuated decreases in permeate stream fluxes if applied directly to these membranes, making it essential to investigate pretreatments that reduce the fouling potential of these leachates.", "3.3.2. Experimental design", "Table 3.2 presents the list of 12 experiments established for the CCD of Landfill 1 as well as the results observed for MFI in each test, expressed in terms of s/L², its reduction calculated over the MFI of raw leachate (1.03x107 s/L²), expressed in terms of %, and the reductions predicted by the mathematical model, also expressed in terms of %.

A possible explanation is that the reduced mass of O 3 was not enough to properly start the degradation mechanisms. Test number 7 was, then, removed from the design, as it is recommended by the method in these cases, since, as an outlier, it would disturb the generation of the mathematical model that properly describes the expected results. The correct model to estimate MFI reduction as a function of the test parameters was, then, established, and it is demonstrated on Equation 3.1.", "Equation 3.1 describes a model with the variables A (pH) and B (O 3 dose), where such variables must be transformed into their coded values, i.e., the variables must be converted, before the response estimation, in their proportional correspondent number in the interval (-1;+1) (which represents (8.0;12.0) for pH and (0.5;1.5) for O 3 dose) or (- 1.41;+1.41), when taking the axial points into account. The R² factor credited to this model is equal to 0.9795, which says that this model is reliable to predict the MFI reduction percentages obtained in each test as long as both parameters are within the evaluated intervals.", "The model is quadratic for variable A with a negative coefficient (-4.06), therefore, it suggests that there is a maximum MFI reduction at pH 12.6. However, this pH value is not within the evaluated pH interval and, so, it is only possible to conclude that, within the evaluated interval, MFI reduction will be maximized at pH 12.0. Also, the model is linear for variable B with a positive coefficient (+4.54), i.e., within the evaluated interval, the bigger the O 3 dose fed to the leachate (1.5 g/L), the greater the MFI reduction will be. At these test conditions, a 99.71% reduction in MFI is expected, which makes it possible to declare that ozonation process shows great potential to reduce membrane fouling of this leachate. Figure 3.3 illustrates the response surface obtained from such model.", "Figure 3.3. Response surface generated from the mathematical model that describes MFI reduction for Landfill 1.", "Table 3.3 presents the list of 12 experiments established for the CCD of Landfill 2 in the same structure as Table 3.2.

Also, the model is linear for variable B with a positive coefficient (+7.22), i.e., within the evaluated interval, the bigger the O 3 dose fed to the leachate (1.5 g/L), the greater the MFI reduction will be. At these test conditions, a 95.12% reduction in MFI is expected, which makes it possible to declare that ozonation process shows great potential to reduce membrane fouling of this leachate, too. Figure 3.4 illustrates the response surface obtained from such model.", "Figure 3.4. Response surface generated from the mathematical model that describes MFI reduction for Landfill 2.", "Comparing Equations 3.1 and 3.2, it is possible to observe that both mathematical models follow similar structures: linear with a positive coefficient for O 3 dose and quadratic with a negative coefficient for pH. The biggest difference between them is the pH value in which MFI reduction is maximized (12.6 for Landfill 1 and 9.0 for Landfill 2). Both values of pH correspond to an alkaline environment, where O 3 acts predominantly generating hydroxyl radicals. However, in less alkaline conditions, like pH 9.0, it is admitted that O 3 direct oxidation may also be a part of organic matter degradation, even if it happens in a smaller scale [35].", "A reduction on the MFI of Landfill 1 leachate of 99.71% is expected on the best evaluated ozonation conditions (pH = 12.0 and O 3 dose = 1.5 g/L). Such process actually produced a pretreated leachate whose MFI was 3.94x105 s/L², which is 96.22% lower than the one from raw leachate (1.03x107 s/L²). Similarly, for Landfill 2, the expected 95.12% reduction on the best evaluated ozonation conditions (pH = 9.0 and O3 dose = 1.5 g/L) was almost observed, since such process actually produced a pretreated leachate whose MFI is 2.04x105 s/L², which is 94.08% lower than the one from raw leachate (3.38x106 s/L²).", "First of all, it is clear the great ability of ozonation to act in the reduction of fouling potential since all reductions, predicted or real, are above 90%. Besides, despite the mathematical models suggesting that MFI would be more intensively reduced in Landfill 1 leachate, in practice, a smaller difference between the MFI reductions is observed. Although all reduction efficiencies are considerably high, MFI final values are still far above those indicated intervals for the direct application in RO membranes when treating water. This points to the conclusion that ozonation process is not proper to be used as a single-step pretreatment. Possibly, the association between ozonation and other treatment techniques would provide a pretreated leachate with even lower MFI values. Torres [36], for example, verified that the isolated use of Fenton reaction, another AOP method, was not enough to reduce the MFI of the studied leachate to a point where it would be suitable for direct application on RO membranes, but, when Fenton reaction was associated with a submerged microfiltration step, the author judged that the resulting water was proper for such application. The work of Torres supports the idea of associating ozonation process to a microfiltration step to improve this pretreatment efficiency.", "Table 3.4 presents the characterization of raw leachate samples and pretreated leachate samples in their respective best conditions of ozonation for both evaluated landfills.", "Table 3.4. Characterization of raw and pretreated samples of leachate (pH = 12.0 and O3 dose = 1.5 g/L for Landfill 1; pH = 9.0 and O 3 dose = 1.5 g/L for Landfill 2). Param.

Such elevation shows influence on the leachate total alkalinity, as it may be observed on Landfill 1, where pretreated leachate alkalinity is higher than the raw leachate one, since the excessive free hydroxyls elevate the total alkalinity measurement. As for Landfill 2, whose operational pH is lower than the one for Landfill 1 and that, therefore, possesses less free hydroxyls at the end of ozonation, total alkalinity is considerably lower in the pretreated leachate than it is in the raw leachate (72.89% lower), even with pH increasing from 7.95 to 8.60, which indicates that ozonation is capable of reducing leachate concentrations of carbonates and bicarbonates. The differences in operational pH caused a variance in the efficiency of ammonia nitrogen removal as well (42.95% removal for Landfill 1 and 20.20% removal for Landfill 2), despite the similarity of ammonia nitrogen concentrations in the raw leachates. It is known that ammonia can be removed from leachate through air stripping, a process based on mass transfer of a gas dissolved in a liquid phase to a gaseous stream, a phenomenon called desorption [34]. The concentration of ammonia nitrogen encompasses the ionized (NH4+) and non-ionized (NH 3) portions of ammonia. These two species present themselves in a chemical balance that depends on the pH given that, at alkaline conditions, the available OH- ions shift the balance to the formation of non-ionized ammonia [34]. Such balance is demonstrated in Equation 3.3.", "As the gaseous stream in air stripping is not capable of desorbing the ionic ammonia, usually, this process depends on the wastewater pH elevation to values close to 12.0 to force the generation of the non-ionic form so that it can be carried by the bubbles [34]. So, it is believed that the ozonation process applied to Landfill 1 leachate, which happened at pH 12.0, was able to desorb ammonia to its gaseous stream in a more effective way than the process applied to Landfill 2, at pH 9.0.", "The evaluation of organic matter content demonstrated that ozonation had just a modest efficiency on its reduction. However, it is curious to notice that, for both leachates, there were reductions in BOD 5/COD ratios, which indicates that the pretreated samples are even less susceptible to biological treatments than the raw ones. This behavior does not follow what is likely to happen for wastewaters that undergo AOP processes, which are frequently used for increasing the biodegradability of organic load [22,37]. As expected, ozonation process showed low efficiencies in reducing conductivity. Nevertheless, as described by Gottschalk et al. [35], high concentrations of inorganic salts in wastewaters make the coalescence of ozone bubbles decrease, which expands the liquid-gas interface, and, therefore, favors the O 3 mass transfer from the gaseous to the liquid phase. It is anticipated that the leachate conductivity will be reduced by RO membranes on a future treatment step.", "The process was greatly efficient to reduce leachate turbidity and color, the last one achieving reductions over 90%. It is known that the dark color of leachate is mainly caused by humic substances, which are also responsible for the great recalcitrance of this effluent [38]. So, it seems that ozonation was particularly effective in transforming such substances. Figure 3.5 illustrates the difference in Landfill 1 leachate’s color before and after ozonation.", "Figure 3.5. Color difference in leachate sample before (a) and after (b) ozonation.", "Chen et al. [13] observed reductions of 41.32%, 68.82% and 83.50% for COD, Abs254 and color, respectively, when applying around 1.6 g of O 3 to treat 2 L of leachate’s concentrate that was previously submitted to a coagulation step. Singh et al. [14] reported reductions in Abs 254 of 65%, 78% and 78% and in the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) of 13%, 15% and 17% for the leachate of three stabilized landfills evaluated in their work. The authors applied around 7 g of ozone to treat 1 L of each leachate. As for Amaral- Silva et al. [39], the authors reported COD reduction of 34% and color reduction of 95% when treating 500 mL of recalcitrant leachate with 1.8 g of O 3 at pH 9.0. All these reduction percentages are similar to what is observed on this Chapter, being high for color, moderate for Abs 254 and low for organic matter content.", "3.3.4. Toxicity", "Table 3.5 presents the results of acute ecotoxicity for the raw leachate from both landfills and their respective pretreated effluents at the best ozonation conditions. Table 3.5. Acute ecotoxicity for raw leachate from Landfills 1 and 2 and pretreated leachates in their respective best ozonation conditions (pH = 12.0 and O 3 dose = 1.5 g/L for Landfill 1; pH = 9.0 and O 3 dose = 1.5 g/L for Landfill 2). Sample EC50 15min EC50 30min aRL1 represents the raw leachate from Landfill 1; bPL1 represents the pretreated leachate from Landfill 1; cRL2 represents the raw leachate from Landfill 2; dPL2 represents the pretreated leachate from Landfill 2.", "Keeping in mind that the lower the EC50, the higher the ecotoxicity to Vibrio Fischeri organisms, it is clear that the ozonation process was able to reduce the samples’ toxicities to a great extent, although both pretreated samples still presented some toxicity. This proves that ozonation did not produce intermediate oxidation products that are more toxic than the original ones in relevant concentrations, which is a phenomenon that actually was observed by Urbano et al. [22]. The authors used an ozonation process to degrade sulfaquinoxaline molecules in low concentrations and noticed that the solution acute ecotoxicity increased (up to 85% of luminosity inhibition in Vibrio fischeri tests) when ozonation happened in alkaline pH. It was also reported by Silva et al. [40], who evaluated the use of ozonation to treat landfill leachate and observed that, while the raw leachate showed an average EC50 of 13.15% to Vibrio Fischeri , the samples after treatment presented average EC50 of 1.74% and 1.18% for ozone doses of 0.5 gO 3/L and 1.5 gO 3/L, respectively.", "The results presented throughout this Chapter attest that ozonation has great capacity to reduce the fouling potential of leachate. They suggest, therefore, that this technology can be applied as an effective pretreatment prior to a RO step, given the operational and efficiency difficulties of RO membranes when applied to leachate treatment. The possibility to reduce membrane fouling by applying a prior ozone treatment step is a promising alternative to make RO membranes a viable and efficient treatment option.", "3.4. Conclusions", "The results demonstrated ozonation great capacity to reduce the fouling potential of both leachates, with real MFI reductions of 96.22% for Landfill 1 and 94.08% for Landfill 2. Also, a similar behavior was observed for these two landfills in the reduction of many evaluated parameters, which indicates that this technology is capable of fitting this kind of wastewater to proper conditions for application on RO membranes. However, it is noteworthy that the optimum operational pH varied considerably from one landfill to the other (12.0 for Landfill 1 and 9.0 for Landfill 2), which provoked differences in the removal efficiencies of some parameters, such as total alkalinity and ammonia nitrogen, and points to the need of an evaluation of the best operational pH on a case-by-case basis. It is worth mentioning that, despite the technical efficacy presented in this study by such method, pH 12.0 is very high and possibly very expensive for practical applications, which is also valid for the O 3 dose applied to both samples. An economic evaluation is required before applying ozonation on this type of treatment. The reductions in BOD 5/COD ratios for both samples go against what is likely to happen for wastewaters that undergo AOP processes, frequently used for increasing the biodegradability of organic load. It was also worth noticing that ozonation significantly reduced leachate toxicity in both cases, since EC50 15min increase from 0.77% to 31.87% for Landfill 1 and from 1.62% to 35.25% for Landfill 2.", "Nonetheless, the best operational conditions for both effluents and their final MFI values suggest that ozonation would hardly be properly applied as a single-step pretreatment and that it would be useful to apply a treatment step like microfiltration along with the ozonation step in order to minimize the O 3 demand and to reduce even more the fouling potential of this wastewater. Such association is expected to provide further improvements on this pretreatment, making it possible to build a treatment plant where ozonation and membrane processes can effectively treat recalcitrant leachates.", "3.5.

Combination of ozonation and microfiltration to suit landfill leachate for reverse osmosis treatment In this chapter, combinations between ozonation process (O 3) and submerged microfiltration (MF) were evaluated as fouling-reducing pretreatments for reverse osmosis (RO) in the treatment of landfill leachate. All leachate samples used in this Chapter were collected at the landfill identified as Landfill 2 in Chapter 3. The modified fouling index (MFI) was used to estimate the fouling potential of raw and pretreated leachates. The results demonstrate that a first ozonation step followed by the microfiltration step represent the best layout, being able to reduce the leachate’s MFI over 170,000 times. The whole treatment (O 3 + MF + RO) is capable of fitting the landfill leachate to the local standards in force for discharge in freshwater bodies. Additionally, it was possible to notice the benefits of using ozonation prior to the microfiltration step when compared to the opposite order, both because of the smaller MFI value obtained (19.53 s/L² instead of 5.10x103 s/L²) and also for the improvement in permeate flux during microfiltration step itself. Finally, the RO permeate fluxes over 6.5 hours of operation suggest that the established pretreatment route is capable of overcoming the operational difficulties presented by this type of membrane when applied in the treatment of a wastewater as complex as landfill leachate.", "A version of this chapter is currently submitted to Journal of Water Process Engineering (IF: 3.465).", "GRAPHICAL ABSTRACT:", "4.1. Introduction", "Landfill is the most used technology for the treatment of Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) worldwide [1]. However, the generation of some by-products, during and after its operation, is inevitable. Landfill leachate, one of these undesirable by-products, is a contaminant liquid that may cause serious environmental problems, such as the pollution of surface water and groundwater [2–4]. It is generated from the microbiological degradation of organic matter contained in the solid waste and water that comes from both its natural moisture and rainwater that percolates the waste pile, infiltrating landfill inner layers [5,6].", "Leachate’s characteristics vary over time and from one place to another. Therefore, the choice of the most appropriate treatment for such wastewater is a challenging task in its management [7,8]. Combinations of separation and destruction mechanisms are recommended for its efficient treatment since it is usually composed of a mixture of suspended/colloidal and dissolved matters in large amounts [9]. There are applications of physical, chemical and biological processes to treat leachate from the most diverse origins.", "In Brazil, biological processes are commonly used in the treatment of landfill leachate as an attempt to reproduce the model consolidated for decades for sewage treatment, since young landfills tend to produce leachate with high biodegradability [1]. However, landfills’ aging promotes the generation of leachates that are richer in recalcitrant organic matter [10], which, along with the stricter environmental regulations, creates a demand for alternative methods to treat this wastewater [11,12]. In this context, membrane separation processes (MSP), particularly reverse osmosis (RO), have been increasingly used to fit leachate for discharge [13–15].", "RO membranes are capable of retaining organic pollutants and inorganic salts, making it able to properly treat complex wastewaters such as landfill leachate [16]. However, this technology struggles with the decrease of permeate flux over operational time [17,18]. This can be caused by concentration polarization, a reversible effect of accumulation of solutes on the membrane surface, or fouling, a partially or totally irreversible effect of membrane alterations [10,19]. The permeate fluxes may get so diminished over operational time that the membrane application is not viable, especially with more restrictive membranes, like RO [20]. Previous investigation suggests that RO inefficiencies are usually caused by improper feed pretreatment [20,21]. Thus, the use of adequate pretreatment steps may help overcome this issue.", "The use of microfiltration (MF) membranes have been considered a good pretreatment method for RO processes since early evaluations [22,23], mainly due to their ability to retain microorganisms and suspended solids, species that could greatly intensify fouling on RO membranes [24]. These studies highlighted, however, the advantages of associating MF to other pretreatment methods that would reduce biofouling propensity, which can cause permeate flux and selectivity reductions on both MF and RO membranes [24]. One option is ozonation, a process that degrades contaminants by the action of a gas stream containing ozone that is fed to the wastewater [25]. Ozone may directly oxidize organic matter or generate hydroxyl radicals (•OH), highly oxidative chemical species that non-selectively degrade organic matter and microorganisms [26]. Ozonation has been effectively applied to reduce membrane fouling during surface and groundwater treatment [27–30] and the combination of oxidation processes and microfiltration has been successfully used in the treatment of landfill leachate to act as pretreatments to high- pressure membranes [31,32].", "In this scenario, the goal of this work is to evaluate the combination of microfiltration and ozonation processes that provides better efficacy of fouling reduction of a leachate from a sanitary landfill located at the metropolitan region of Rio de Janeiro State (Brazil). The modified fouling index (MFI) was used to estimate the fouling potential of raw and all pretreated leachates. The chosen pretreatment route was, then, applied to different leachate samples before feeding them to an RO membrane. These samples were characterized before and after each treatment step in order to verify the step’s contribution to the treatment as a whole. Toxicity tests were also performed to evaluate the impact of this process combination on the local biota. The findings of this work are expected to generate relevant information concerning the viability of this treatment option for landfill leachate worldwide. Additionally, an effective pretreatment is supposed to minimize costs with RO membrane replacements due to the improvement in its lifespan.", "4.2. Material and methods For this Chapter, leachate samples were collected from the equalization pond of a landfill located at the metropolitan region of Rio de Janeiro State (Brazil). The samples were stored refrigerated at temperature lower than 10°C until the moment of pretreatment.", "4.2.1. Pretreatment combinations", "The pretreatment routes evaluated were composed of ozonation process and/or submerged microfiltration membrane process, as described in Figure 4.1. The evaluation of their efficiencies was made through modified fouling index (MFI), which is an index that describes the fouling potential of a specific liquid sample during filtration processes.", "Figure 4.1. Pretreatment routes evaluated in Chapter 4.", "4.2.2. Modified fouling index", "Although it is a mere indication of how fouling formation will behave during filtration in the existing membrane system, MFI allows the assessment of the fouling potential through the use of a small liquid sample and disposable membranes. It is assessed in a pressurized system where the liquid sample percolates a 0.45 µm (Millipore) membrane with 47 mm in diameter at 0.2 MPa (30 psi) and at room temperature (25°C). Figure 4.2 illustrates the MFI unit scheme.", "Figure 4.2. Scheme of the MFI unit.", "A chart of the inverse of filtration rate (t/V) as a function of permeate stream volume (V) is plotted. MFI is defined as the slope of the chart’s straight region [33]. The steeper the slope, the greater the capacity of the liquid to cause fouling. The establishment of fouling indexes, like MFI, is important for the design of treatment systems with reverse osmosis (RO) membranes since wastewaters that present excessive indexes may cause irreversible deposition on the membrane, reducing the permeate stream flux and harming the process performance [31,34]..", "4.2.3. Ozonation Ozonation tests were all performed in an ozonation unit put together for this particular assays. Figure 4.3 illustrates a scheme of such unit.", "Figure 4.3. Scheme of the ozonation unit.", "Ozonation unit is composed of an O 3 generator, an analyzer of O 3 concentration on the gas stream, a semi-continuous reactor (where leachate is batch fed before the unit’s start whilst gas stream is continuously fed to it), two O 3 destruction baths and an altered foam-collecting vessel, as well as all the hoses and manual valves necessary to ensure a proper gas flow through the unit.", "The semi-continuous reactor needs to be batch-fed with the sample to be ozonated before the operation starts. pH adjustment to the specific value of each experiment was previously performed with 50% w/w NaOH solution or with commercial HCl solution (purity of 37%). These high concentrations were necessary in order to minimize dilution effects in the sample that might mask the results. During operation, the unit is continuously fed with a gas stream containing 99.5% of O 2 at the gauge pressure of 62 kPa (9 psi) and a fixed flow rate of 5 L/min (following the instructions of the O 3 generator manufacturer). The gas stream flows into the generator where O 3 is produced from the O 2 molecules by the action of an electrical discharge.", "Regular operation happens with valve A1 open and valves A2 and A3 closed, so that the generator’s outlet gas stream feeds the semi-continuous reactor through a diffuser plate to divide it into small bubbles. At regular time intervals, these three valves switch in order to reintroduce the recovered leachate in the foam-collecting vessel to the reactor. The O 3 analyzer continuously measures O 3 concentrations in the gas stream in terms of g/m³. Valves B1 and B2 allow the measurement of O 3 concentration in the feed gas stream or in the exhausted gas stream. The difference between these two throughout the assay is used to estimate the O 3 dose fed to the leachate. The process stops by ceasing the gas stream feeding.", "The results in Chapter 3 have shown that the higher the O 3 dose, the higher the reduction of fouling potential and that the operational pH should be evaluated on a case- by-case basis. Therefore, all ozonation assays herein happened with a sample volume of 1 L, with a fixed O 3 mass of 1 g transferred to it. The operational pH evaluated were 6.0, 8.0, 10.0 and 12.0. The efficiency of ozonation process was assessed by means of MFI reduction, measured in triplicate.", "4.2.4. Submerged microfiltration The microfiltration assays took place at a submerged MF system whose scheme is illustrated in Figure 4.4.", "Figure 4.4. Scheme of the submerged microfiltration unit.", "The unit is composed of a leachate tank, where the MF module (0.1–0.4 µm hollow- fiber membranes, 0.1 m² of permeation area, Pam Membranas – Rio de Janeiro, Brazil) is submerged in the wastewater to be treated, a pressure gauge, a vacuum pump and an air compressor. The pump applies a continuous negative pressure (-0.1 MPa) in the interior of the hollow fibers, which causes the permeable compounds in the leachate to be sucked-in and led to a collecting vessel while the non-permeable compounds accumulate in the tank.", "The air compressor injects bubbles inside the module at a continuous flow rate (F air) of 2.5 L/h in order to create stirring that reduces the concentration polarization effect in the vicinities of the membrane surface. Backwash was not performed because, after reversing the flux orientation, the system could not recover the operational pressure at a feasible time to resume operation. The microfiltration was applied both on the raw leachate and on the leachate after ozonation in the best evaluated operational pH. Each MF cycle lasted 150 minutes with an initial leachate volume of 20 L inside the tank. The permeate flux behavior over time was observed.", "Three methods of chemical cleaning were evaluated to be applied in between MF cycles in order to reduce fouling effects and recover the module’s permeability. The efficiency of each cleaning method was assessed by a recuperation factor, which represents the membrane’s water permeability (L P) after chemical cleaning calculated over the one from the clogged membrane, right before the cleaning process. The three cleaning methods were:", "a) 3 g/L sodium hypochlorite (NaClO) bath for 1 hour; b) 1 g/L citric acid (C 6H8O7) bath for 24 hours followed by 50 g/L sodium percarbonate (Na 2CO3·1.5H2O2) bath for 30 minutes; c) 0.1 g/L sodium hypochlorite (NaClO) bath for 24 hours followed by 50 g/L sodium percarbonate (Na 2CO3·1.5H2O2) bath for 30 minutes. The method with the highest recuperation factor was later applied in between permeation cycles for both raw and ozonated leachate.", "Samples of raw leachate that underwent the microfiltration step were also submitted to the ozonation process in the same operational pH as for the raw leachate to produce samples pretreated by route #4. Then, samples of leachate after all five pretreatment routes had their MFI values assessed, in triplicate, in order to establish the best pretreatment route prior to RO step.", "4.2.5. Reverse osmosis", "The chosen best pretreatment route was applied to two leachate samples from the same landfill collected in different moments. The pretreated leachates were submitted to an RO step in a similar system to the one used for MFI assessment and illustrated in Figure 4.2, but with a cross-flow RO membrane (TW30-1812-100, Dow Filmtec – Miami, USA) instead of an MF flat one. The RO operations lasted for 6.5 hours at a feeding pressure of 0.5 MPa (73 psi) with initial volumes of pretreated leachate in the feeding tank equal to 20 L. The permeate flux behavior over time was observed. At each treatment step, samples were analyzed through the following parameters (along with their analytical method, according to APHA [35], and their equipment): Absorbance at 254 nm – Abs 254 (5910 B – Shimadzu UV mini 1240 and quartz cuvettes of 10 mm lightpath); Total alkalinity (2320 B – Automatic Burette Tritette Class A); Chloride ions concentration (4500 D); True color (2120 C – Spectrophotometer DR2800 Hach and quartz cuvettes of 50 mm lightpath); Chemical Oxygen Demand – COD (5220 D - Spectrophotometer DR2800 and reactor Hach); Ammonia nitrogen – NH 3-N (4500- NH3 E – Orion 4 star Thermo pH ISE portable); pH (4500-H+ B – pHmeter microprocessor Quimis); turbidity (2130 B – Turbidimeter: Poli Control-AP 2000). Acute ecotoxicity tests using Allivibrio fischeri , also known as Vibrio fischeri or Photobacterium phosphoreum , were also performed. It was used the methodology described in the Brazilian Standard NBR 15411-3 [36] in Microtox equipment (SDI, Analyzer model 500) with a lyophilized strain from Umwelt Biotecnologia Ambiental (Blumenau, Brazil). Assays ran over 15 and 30 minutes and results were expressed in terms of EC50, i.e., the effective concentration of leachate in the dilution where a 50% reduction in luminescence is observed. The lower the EC50, the higher the samples ecotoxicity to Vibrio Fischeri organisms.", "4.3. Results and discussion", "4.3.1. Ozonation", "Table 4.1 presents the results in triplicate of MFI for raw leachate and for its ozonated samples in different initial pH values.

Deviation (s/L²) Reductiona Raw leachate 3.31x106 aReduction percentage of MFI calculated over the MFI of raw leachate. It is possible to notice that the ozonation process presents higher MFI reduction efficiencies between pH 8.0 and 10.0, being slightly higher for pH 8.0, which is beneficial for this application since it is close to the natural pH range of the leachate samples (between 7.0 and 8.0). At pH 8.0, this ozonation process showed to be capable of causing a significant reduction of MFI, which is almost 90% lower than the one of raw leachate. This MFI reduction percentage is similar to the values reported in Chapter 3 by ozonation applied to similar landfill leachate samples. On the other hand, it has also been reported that ozonation may enhance the fouling potential of landfill leachate [14], which, once again, demonstrates the need of evaluating the best treatment route on a case-by-case basis.", "In the literature, higher pH values are usually reported to cause improvements in ozonation process’ efficiency. For instance, pH 11 was reported to provide the best COD reduction [37] and Abs 254 reduction [38] of a mature landfill leachate. It is known that the pH exerts major influence on the degradation mechanisms of ozonation, since higher pH values tend to generate hydroxyl radicals, starting an indirect degradation, while lower pH values are more propense to undergo the direct ozone degradation, which is more selective to cyclic and unsaturated organic compounds [39]. In an intermediate pH value, as the one observed in this Chapter, it is admitted that both mechanisms take place, which seems to favor the MFI reduction of this particular leachate. The pH 8.0 was, therefore, established as the one in which ozonation process must occur in all ozonation assays presented henceforth.", "4.3.2. Submerged microfiltration Table 4.2 presents the results of chemical cleaning methods applied to the clogged MF membrane module to recover its water permeability (L P) after operation cycles of 150 minutes at -0.1 MPa with raw leachate. The curves from which L P values were extracted are presented in Supplementary Material B, along with the permeate flux behavior of raw leachate after each of the three cleaning methods. Table 4.2. Evaluation of the chemical cleaning methods applied to the clogged MF membrane module (after permeation of raw leachate samples) for the recovery of its water permeability.", "Cleaning method Clogged L P (L h-1 m-2 bar-1) Recovered L P (L h-1 m-2 bar-1) Recovery Factor", "Cleaning method (c) (0.1 g/L sodium hypochlorite bath for 24 hours followed by 50 g/L sodium percarbonate bath for 30 minutes) showed the highest recovery factor among the evaluated routes. Comparing cleaning methods (b) and (c), it is clear that the alkaline solution was more effective for recovering the membrane’s permeability than the acidic one. Also, comparing methods (a) and (c), it seems that the addition of a cleaning step with peroxide-based product helped enhance the recovery factor. All this information suggests that leachate fouling on the MF membrane is mainly caused by organic colloids, particulate materials and microorganisms rather than by inorganic scaling, since alkaline cleaning solutions are normally used for organic and colloidal fouling, acidic cleaning solutions, for inorganic scaling and peroxide is used for membrane disinfection, reducing biofouling [40]. This same behavior was observed by Torres [31] when evaluating cleaning procedures for microfiltration membranes applied to treat landfill leachate. Method (c) was, therefore, established as the cleaning method and was applied between every permeation cycle described henceforth.", "Figure 4.5 presents the permeate flux over time on the MF membranes. Permeations were made with raw leachate or ozonated leachate at pH = 8.0. After each 150 minutes of permeation, the established chemical cleaning method was applied in order to recover the permeate flux.", "Figure 4.5. Permeate flux behavior over time on the submerged microfiltration membrane of raw leachate or ozonated leachate at pH = 8.0 (P = -0.1 MPa;", "The curves in Figure 4.5 show the benefits of applying an ozonation step prior to the MF one, since the permeate fluxes of the ozonated samples remain further above the flux values of the raw leachate samples throughout the whole operation. This same benefit has been previously reported when applying ozonation to humic acid solutions prior to MF membranes [41]. The permeate flux of raw leachate samples instantly drops to less than 10% of the initial permeation in the chemically cleaned membrane module. Not only is the flux decay attenuated for the ozonated sample, but also its final value (at the steady state) seems to settle at a much higher permeate flux. These results corroborate the ones presented in Table 4.1, which indicates that ozonation can greatly reduce leachate’s capacity of causing fouling on MF membranes. They are also in accordance with MFI great reductions by ozonation reported in the results of Chapter 3. 020406080100120140 t (min)raw O3", "4.3.3. Pretreatment combinations", "After applying an ozonation step to a previously microfiltered leachate sample in the same operational conditions that were used in the raw ones (pH = 8.0; m O3 = 1 g; Vleachate = 1 L), all pretreatment routes described in Figure 4.1 were performed and their MFI assessment, in triplicate, are presented in Table 4.3. The curves from which MFI values were obtained are displayed in Supplementary Material C. Table 4.3. Modified fouling index of leachate samples after combined ozonation and microfiltration pretreatment routes.", "Route Pretreatment MFI (s/L²) R² Average Deviation (s/L²) Reductiona aReduction percentage of MFI calculated over the MFI of raw leachate. These results point to the great capacity of both technologies to reduce the fouling potential of leachate, both individually and in combination, since all pretreatment routes reached values of MFI reduction close to 90.0% or higher. It is curious to observe that the leachate sample after microfiltration still presents a considerably high MFI value, which, in theory, should not happen once the MFI assessment takes place at a disposable MF membrane (0.45 µm). It is only intuitive that the submerged MF step would retain all compounds capable of depositing on the membrane surface of the later MFI apparatus, reducing it to values close to zero. The observation of MFI still elevated for the sample after MF step could be caused by differences between filtration operations or even between the membranes’ materials of submerged microfiltration process and MFI assessment. However, the most probable explanation is in the fact that fouling, besides harming permeate flux, also hampers the membrane selectivity [24]. Thus, the quick fouling formation observed through the accentuated permeate flux drop of raw leachate (Figure 4.5) is also responsible for lowering the submerged microfiltration membrane selectivity and, therefore, reducing the permeate stream quality. This phenomenon is one more reason for combining both pretreatment technologies. The combinations between both methods were especially effective, presenting MFI reductions higher than 99.8% in both cases. The sample that went through ozonation followed by microfiltration, besides presenting higher permeate fluxes during MF step itself, showed final MFI under 20 s/L², which is considerably smaller than the 3.34x106 s/L² presented by the raw leachate.", "This value is half of the one obtained by Torres [31], who used Fenton process (another advanced oxidation process (AOP) method) followed by submerged MF to reduce the MFI of a stabilized landfill leachate of Rio de Janeiro. This indicates that ozonation may act more efficiently than Fenton process in this pretreatment route, besides holding the advantage of not generating sludge during oxidation. It is also 30 times lower than the one obtained by Alfaia et al. [42], who used coagulation/flocculation processes to reduce leachate’s MFI, which points that the combination of oxidation and separation methods is much more efficient for that purpose than the conventional treatments. Finally, Chang et al. [43] reported the use of sequential coagulation/flocculation, microfiltration and ultrafiltration to reduce the MFI of previously biotreated leachate samples from a six- year closed landfill in Taiwan. The authors obtained an MFI reduction from 5.50x105 s/L² (which is already six times lower than the raw leachate of this work) to 28.5 s/L², which is a little higher than the final MFI value of this work, even with the extra UF final step. Additionally, as previously mentioned, ozonation may be more advantageous as an RO pretreatment than Fenton process and coagulation/flocculation since it does not generate residues that would add to the RO concentrate before recirculation to the landfill. This characteristic fits the recently approved law #9055 of the State of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil [44], which establishes that the re-introduction of residues from leachate treatment to the landfill of origin is allowed as long as it does not exceed 1/3 (in volume or mass) of the leachate generated by it.", "An MFI value of 20 s/L² is still above the intervals usually described as proper for water desalination through RO membranes (between 0 and 1 s/L² [45] or between 0 and 2 s/L² [34]). However, there is no consensus among the scientific community about such intervals for RO membrane application on wastewater treatments. Either way, this value is 170,000 times smaller than the MFI of raw leachate, which represents a substantial improvement for the process in terms of fouling reduction. Route #5 was, therefore, selected as the best pretreatment prior to the RO step and the whole treatment was applied to leachate samples collected from this same landfill in two distinct moments (samples A and B) in order to validate the efficacy of this process.", "4.3.4. Reverse osmosis", "The normalized permeate flux behavior in the reverse osmosis system of these two pretreated samples (samples A and B) over operational time is illustrated in Figure 4.6.", "Figure 4.6. Normalized permeate flux over operational time in the reverse osmosis system of two distinct leachate samples (samples A and B) after pretreatment by route #5 (ozonation followed by microfiltration).", "The charts in Figure 4.6 show that the permeate flux drop is not very accentuated, maintaining itself above 80% of its initial value after 6.5 hours of operation for both leachate samples, which demonstrates the efficacy of the pretreatment method applied in 0,00,20,40,60,81,01,2 t (h)sample A sample B preserving the RO permeability. Table 4.4 presents the characterization of both these samples in their raw forms and after each treatment step. Table 4.4.

Overall, the characterization results demonstrate the great importance of all treatment steps, where each of them is responsible for the improvement of leachate quality in different parameters at different efficiency ratios. The complete treatment route is responsible for expressive pollutant reductions, above 97% for almost all evaluated parameters. pH for both leachate samples is higher after ozonation, which is due to the pH adjustment prior to this process and natural pH variation during oxidation reactions. Such elevation shows influence on the leachate alkalinity since the excessive free hydroxyls elevate the total alkalinity measurement, making ozonated samples present higher alkalinity than the raw ones in both cases. pH and alkalinity did not change much during MF step, but the total alkalinity greatly reduced during RO step, probably due to the retention of carbonates and bicarbonates by the RO membrane.", "The evaluation of organic matter content demonstrated that ozonation had significant effect on its reduction, which can be perceived both by COD and by Abs 254 values in both cases. The efficiency of COD and Abs 254 observed are similar or higher to what is commonly observed in the literature when ozonation is applied to leachate treatment [13,14,46]. The same effect was not observed by MF step, where these parameters did not change much, which suggests that the most significant part of organic matter still in the samples after ozonation is dissolved, not suspended. This remaining organic matter was effectively removed by the RO step, which results in an overall organic matter reduction close to 99% for both parameters.", "The ozonation step presents a slight reduction of ammonia nitrogen, which is a bit further removed by the MF step. The reduction of ammonia concentration by both steps is probably caused by air stripping, i.e., a mass transfer of gas dissolved in a liquid phase to a gaseous stream that contains a lower concentration of such gas, a phenomenon called desorption [45]. Air stripping is commonly applied for the removal of ammonia from landfill leachate and it is highly effective when the pH is adjusted to values above 11, but not that much for lower operational pH values, like this one [15,47]. Since both pretreatment steps encompass a gas stream that is continuously fed to the leachate throughout the process, their bubbles were able to carry some of the dissolved gaseous ammonia. However, the biggest reduction takes place on the RO membrane, where almost all the remaining ammonia nitrogen is retained.", "The greatest contribution of MF step to the leachate quality seem to be in the reduction of turbidity, a parameter that is associated to the presence of suspended matter, which is greatly responsible for membrane fouling [24]. It makes sense since this treatment step was applied mainly as a way to preserve the RO membrane lifespan rather than as a method to directly improve the leachate quality. Ozonation also reduced partially the turbidity prior to MF step and the remaining turbidity after MF was greatly removed by RO membrane, presenting overall reductions higher than 99% in both cases. As for color reduction, ozonation step showed to be particularly effective, being responsible for most of its removal. This observation corroborates results previously published in the literature, which report that color is the parameter most affected by ozonation when applied in the treatment of landfill leachate [13,46]. The same observation occurred in the results of Chapter 3 when ozonation was also applied to leachate samples from landfills in Rio de Janeiro State. In the results of this Chapter, the whole process caused an overall color reduction above 99% where ozonation alone was responsible for the removal of more than 80% of it. Figure 4.7 illustrates the changes in leachate’s color at each treatment stage.", "Figure 4.7. Color changes of leachate sample B at each treatment stage, where (a) represents the raw leachate, (b), the sample after ozonation, (c) after ozonation and microfiltration and (d), after ozonation, microfiltration and reverse osmosis.", "When analyzing the chloride ions concentrations, as expected, it is clear that RO step was the sole responsible for their reductions, above 97% in both cases, which leads to final chloride concentrations much lower than what is established by national standards in force for freshwater bodies (Cl- < 250 mg/L) [48]. Other parameters that are specified in local resolutions for wastewater discharge in water bodies [49,50] are also within the range established (5.0 < pH < 9.0; COD < 200 mgO 2/L; NH 3-N < 20 mg/L) for both RO permeates, which suggests that this treatment route is capable of fitting landfill leachates to proper discharge conditions.", "Table 4.5 presents the results of Vibrio Fischeri acute ecotoxicity for leachate sample B at each step of treatment.", "Table 4.5. Acute ecotoxicity of leachate sample B at each step of treatment (ozonation, microfiltration and reverse osmosis) for Vibrio Fischeri . sample EC50 (15 min) EC50 (30min)", "Keeping in mind that the lower the EC50, the higher the ecotoxicity to Vibrio Fischeri organisms, it is clear that each treatment step significantly contributes to the reduction of ecotoxicity of leachate. It is important to highlight that no treatment step caused toxicity enhancement, which is likely to happen for oxidation processes like ozonation [25]. This phenomenon was, indeed, reported by Silva et al. [51], who evaluated the use of ozonation to treat landfill leachate and observed that, while the raw leachate showed an average EC50 of 13.15% to Vibrio Fischeri , the samples after treatment presented average EC50 of 1.74% and 1.18% for ozone doses of 0.5 gO 3/L and 1.5 gO 3/L, respectively.", "Torres [31] used a combination of AOP (Fenton process) and submerged microfiltration to treat landfill leachate and observed an EC50 improvement to Vibrio Fischeri from 9.4% in the raw sample to 70.5% in the treated one. Despite the great toxicity reduction, the process was not able to entirely remove the toxicity on these organisms. This information suggests an advantage of using ozonation instead of Fenton process for the oxidation step of this treatment since, in the present work, the sample after ozonation and microfiltration steps showed no toxicity (>100%) to the same organisms. This hypothesis is corroborated by the work of Bastos [52], who applied ozonation to treat a raw landfill leachate sample that presented EC50 of 2.04% and, after oxidation, the samples presented no ecotoxicity to the same organisms.", "In this work, the sample after microfiltration and the final sample, after RO, did not present acute ecotoxicity to the organisms evaluated. The results of ecotoxicity, along with the previous results presented in this Chapter, demonstrate that the treatment that is proposed (O 3 + MF + RO) is capable of fitting landfill leachates to the standards in force for discharge in freshwater bodies or even for its reuse in the landfill.", "4.4. Conclusions", "This Chapter demonstrates the great capacity of ozonation and microfiltration processes to work as pretreatments for reverse osmosis membranes to treat landfill leachate. The combinations between both methods were especially effective for the reduction of leachate’s fouling potential, presenting MFI reductions higher than 99.8%. The sample that went through ozonation followed by microfiltration showed final MFI under 20 s/L², which is considerably smaller than the 3.34x106 s/L² presented by the raw leachate.", "It was possible to notice the benefits of using ozonation before the microfiltration step compared to the opposite order, not only because of the smaller MFI value obtained (19.53 s/L² instead of 5.10x103 s/L²), but also for the permeate flux improvement during the microfiltration step. Chemical cleaning showed to be effective for recovering the microfiltration membrane permeability, since cleaning baths of sodium hypochlorite and sodium percarbonate were capable of increasing more than 6 times the water permeability of the clogged module.", "Finally, the RO permeate fluxes of pretreated leachate after 6.5 hours of operation were still above 80% of its initial values, which suggests that the established pretreatment route is capable of overcoming the operational difficulties presented by this type of membrane when applied in the treatment of a wastewater as complex as landfill leachate. The use of such techniques prior to the RO step would vastly improve this membrane’s lifespan, reducing the costs with constant replacements. The final treated samples presented reductions higher than 97% for almost all parameters evaluated when compared to the values of their respective untreated samples.

Final Considerations", "5.1. Conclusions", "The main objective of this thesis was to evaluate combinations between advanced oxidation processes (AOP), specifically ozonation, and membrane separation processes (MSP) in order to produce an effective treatment route for recalcitrant landfill leachate samples. The focus was on the evaluation of pretreatments that mitigate the harmful effects of leachate to reverse osmosis membranes, improving the permeate flux over operational time and reducing costs with cleaning and replacements of membrane modules.", "The first results demonstrated ozonation great capacity to reduce the fouling potential of leachate samples from two distinct landfills, with real modified fouling index (MFI) reductions of 96.22% for Landfill 1 and 94.08% for Landfill 2. Also, a similar behavior was observed for these two landfills in the reduction of many evaluated parameters, which indicates that this technology is capable of fitting this kind of wastewater to proper conditions for application on RO membranes. However, it was observed that the optimum operational pH varied considerably from one landfill to the other (12.0 for Landfill 1 and 9.0 for Landfill 2), which provoked differences in the removal efficiencies of some parameters, such as total alkalinity and ammonia nitrogen, and points to the need of an evaluation of the best operational pH on a case-by-case basis. It is worth mentioning that, despite the technical efficacy presented by ozonation in this condition, pH 12.0 is very high and possibly very expensive for practical applications, which is also valid for the optimized O 3 dose applied to both samples (1.5 g/L). An economic evaluation is required before applying ozonation on this type of treatment.", "The reductions in BOD 5/COD ratios observed for the samples of both landfills go against what is likely to happen for wastewaters that undergo AOP processes, frequently used for increasing the biodegradability of organic load. It was also worth noticing that ozonation significantly reduced leachate toxicity in both cases, since EC50 15min increased from 0.77% to 31.87% for Landfill 1 and from 1.62% to 35.25% for Landfill 2. Nonetheless, the best operational conditions for both effluents and their final MFI values suggest that ozonation would hardly be appropriately applied as a single-step pretreatment. Thus, it would be useful to apply a treatment step like microfiltration along with the ozonation step in order to minimize the O 3 demand and to reduce even more the fouling potential of this wastewater. In this scenario, new leachate samples were submitted to different combinations of ozonation and microfiltration in order to improve the proposed pretreatment to reverse osmosis.", "These new results demonstrate the great capacity of both ozonation and microfiltration processes to work as pretreatments for reverse osmosis membranes to treat landfill leachate. The combinations between both methods were especially effective for the reduction of leachate’s fouling potential, presenting MFI reductions higher than 99.8%.

Recommendations for future work", " Verify the economic feasibility of the proposed treatment as well as its scale-up to applications on actual landfills;  Evaluate possible modifications in ozonation process and reactor in order to promote better ozone diffusion to the liquid phase;  Evaluate the possibility of reusing the ozonation exhausted gas stream as the air injection during microfiltration step in order to improve ozone utilization;  Study the differences in fouling mechanism of raw and pretreated leachates in order to further understand the phenomena involved in these processes;  Verify the possibility of treated leachate’s reuse rather than its discharge."]}

Taxonomic revision resulted so far in one new genus ( Parasymmela gen. n. ) and 18 new species: Parasymmela amazonica sp. n. , P. howdeni sp. n. , Raysymmela equatorialis sp. n. , Raysymmela erwini sp. n. , Symmela beskei sp. n. , S. capixaba sp. n. , S. clarki sp. n. , S. erichsoni sp. n. , S. fuhrmanni sp. n. , S. guerlini sp. n. , S. iannuzziae sp. n. , S. martinezi sp. n., S. nunesorum sp. n. , S. paraguayensis sp. n. , S. pseudopaca sp. n. , S. reischei sp. n. , S. terezae sp. n. , S. unidentata sp. n. We raise Sayloria Frey, 1973, a former subgenus of Symmela Erichson, 1835, to genus level, that includes now three species. Further, the study resulted in the following new synonymies and new combinations: Raysymmela pallipes (Blanchard, 1850) (= Symmela boliviensis Moser, 1918, syn. n.); Symmela longula Erichson, 1835 (= S. angustula Moser, 1919, syn. n. ); Symmela nitida Erichson, 1835 (= S. tenella Erichson, 1835, syn. n. ); Sayloria bicoloripes (Saylor, 1946) comb. n.

One Astaena species resulted to be member of Sericoidiini: Manonychus robustus (Frey, 1973) comb. n. , another one a senior synonym of a species known from India being thus not part of the Neotropical fauna: Neoserica pubescens (Burmeister, 1855) comb. n.

In this framework I investigated the systematic placement of a newly discovered first non -feeding lineage of Sericini (Parasymmela gen. n. ) which is characterized by a num ber of synapomorhies that are very divergent from related species, and many of these are related to non -feeding. In this context, the subtribe Astaenina Burmeister, 1855 is re -established.", "The topology of phylogenetic analyses contrasted in many cases current classification: While in the separate analysis (Chapter 5) under inclusion of a few extra -generic members of Neotropical Sericini, Symmela resulted monophyletic, it did not in the all -taxa analysis. Astaena and Raysymmela in none of the analyses resulted monophyletic. Sayloria and Parasymmela always resulted in monophyletic clades.", "Finally, comparing the two major sister clades, Old World and Neotropical Sericini, in terms of their morph ological disparity and diversity, the here elaborated data (plots & distances) do not support the hypothesis that morphological disparity could be a driver for the diversity of Sericini in the Old World. General body shape and single morphological characte rs appear under similar general evolutionary pressure: high morphometric disparity between nocturnal and diurnal Neotropical species was also corroborated by disparity estimated from discrete morphological characters.", "Key words: Beetles, taxonomy , phylogeny , morphometrics , South America.", "Rio de Janeiro Julho de 2021", "2 All other species of Astaena including many taxa new to science will be treated subsequently in a separate monograph.

Color coding of Neotropical genera corresponds to that of Fig . 4.", "INTRODUCTION", "Beetles (Coleoptera) represent one of the largest groups of organisms in the Animal kingdom (Zhang 2013) including ca. 400,000 species. They are subdivided into five suborders: Protocoleoptera (fossil species only), Archostemata, Myxophaga, Adephaga, and P olyphaga (Bouchard et al. 2011). The suborder Polyphaga represents the most diverse lineage, allocating 16 superfamilies, and includes also the Scarabaeoidea. Scarabaeoidea is mainly diagnosed by the presence of lamellate antennae and dentate anterior tibiae (Kohlmann & Morón 2003). They are therefore known also as Lamellicornia.", "Based on morphological characters of adults and larvae but also based on molecular data, Scarabaeoidea is well supported as a monophyletic group (e.g., Lawrence et al. 2011; Hunt et al. 2007; Bocak et al. 2014; McKenna et al. 2019), although its classification is not consensual (e.g., Smith 2006; Cherman & Morón 2014). While former authors such as Janssens (1949) recognized three families within Scarabaeoidea (Lucanidae , Passalidae, and Scarabaeidae), there are others such as Paulian (1988) who elevate this number to 29, maintaining Lucanidae and Passalidae, but rising to the category of family taxa that are classified by other authors as groups of single genera or subfa milies within Scarabaeidae. According to the currently widely accepted proposal of Bouchard et al. (2011), Scarabaeoidea presents 12 families, highlighting Scarabaeidae that allocates 16 subfamilies with current representatives. The latter family can be al so separated in two major groups of feeding habits: dung beetles (Scarabaeinae + Aphodiinae) and herbivore chafers (pleurostict Scarabaeidae) (Scholtz & Grebennikov 2006).", "The evolution of scarabs was mainly influenced by the uprising of Angiosperms but al so but the follow up radiation of dung beetles on ungulates dung (Mammalia) (Ahrens et al. 2014 d). The latter diversified successfully after the K -T event and the extinction of dinosaurs (dos Reis et al. 2012). In terms of species diversity, the subfamily Melolonthinae stands out, whose representatives are phytophagous as adults and primarily saprophagous or rhizophagous as larvae. Adults, but most of all larval stages, in Brazil widely known as 'corós' (white grubs), are often pests in agricultural plantat ions (e.g., Morón 2004; Pereira & Salvadori 2006; Jackson & Klein 2006).", "Recent phylogenetic analyses of Scarabaeidae have shown discrepancies between current classification and resulting phylogenetic trees, particularly in herbivorous chafers, such as the paraphyly or polyphyly of several groups (e.g., Tanyproctini; Rutelinae, Melolonthinae)", "(Šípek et al. 2016; Eberle et al. 2019; Neita Moreno et al. 2019) revealing thus the need for further, more detailed analyses that are able to produce more robustly su pported tree topologies.", "In the past two decades, the taxonomic and systematic study of South American scarab beetles had an enormous boost with numerous trained students, special training programs, and grant schemes (e.g., Partnerships for Enhancing Exper tise in Taxonomy (PEET); https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2004/nsf04606/nsf04606.htm). This resulted in many new taxonomic publications of hitherto poorly studied groups, particularly in herbivorous chafers (e.g., Jameson 1998; Evans 2003; Smith 2003; Ratcliffe 20 03, 2018; Jameson & Swoboda 2005; Jameson & Hawkins 2005; Ratcliffe & Cave 2006, 2015, 2017; Katovich 2008; Jameson & Ratcliffe 2011; Ratcliffe et al. 2013; Di Iorio 2013; Smith & Mondaca 2015; Fuhrmann & Vaz -de-Mello 2017; Smith & Evans 2018; Moore et al. 2018; Fuhrmann 2019). So far, one major impediment (Wheeler et al. 2004; Carvalho et al. 2005) was the access of critical type material, often housed in North American or European natural history collections. In course of these efforts, taxonomic revision s, keys, web pages, illustrated guides, and checklists have been created. Despite this enormous progress, several groups remained nevertheless orphans, i.e. they did not yet receive any appropriate taxonomic treatment. Among these groups is the tribe Seric ini.", "Sericini are one of the most diverse tribes of pleurostict chafers including around worldwide more than 4000 described species being one of 27 tribes recognized of supposedly paraphyletic Melolonthinae (Ahrens et al. 2014 d; McKenna et al. 2019). They have a nearly cosmopolitan distribution (not occurring Australia) and had their origin in the Cretaceous (Ahrens et al. 2014 d; Eberle et al. 2017 a; McKenna et al. 2019). Sericini was recognized as monophylum based on phylogenetic analyses with morphologic al and molecular characters (Ahrens 2006 a, Ahrens & Vogler 2008; Ahrens et al. 2014 d).", "In the Neotropics, representatives of the Sericini tribe are currently classified into five genera, four of which occur in South and Central America: Symmela Erichson, 1835 (21 species described), Astaena Erichson, 1847 (132 spp.), Raysymmela Saylor, 1947 (4 spp ), and Miotemna Lacordaire, 1856 (monospecific). The fifth genus, Serica McLeay, 1819, occurs only in North America (Evans 2003), it is a monophyletic lineage of the Old Word Sericini clade (Eberle et al. 2017 a).", "The South American species of Sericin i were described mainly by German entomologists, namely Carl H. C. Burmeister, Wilhelm F. Erichson, Julius Moser, and Georg Frey (see", "Table 1). The current collections containing their respective series are housed at the European cities of Halle and Berlin (Germany), and Basel (Switzerland) (see Horn et al. 1990). After the original descriptions of most of the species, Frey (1973) presented the only comprehensive review of the South American species of the Sericini tribe. However, he provided descriptions o f the newest species only as a dichotomous key, not employing rigorously genitalia characters as standard for species diagnosis that are since the works of Ohaus in the beginning of the 20th century (e.g., Ohaus 1901) known as highly informative in the tax onomy of Scarabaeidae. This new knowledge, in particularly the use of genital morphology in taxonomy, underlines the need for a taxonomic revision.", "In a first cladistic -like approach, Machatschke (1959) treated the South American within the subtribe Serici na and did not investigate them in detail. So far, the only test of monophyly of South American lineages of Sericini was conducted by Ahrens (2006 a) using a few taxa of the genera of this region (without including the genus Miotemna ). Symmela , Astaena and Raysymmela were recovered as a well -supported clade. The monophyly of the South American Sericini genera is based on the following synapomorphies: 1) palpiger and prementum separated by a suture, 2) palpiger and ligular lobes separated, and 3) prementum and ligular lobes separated by a suture (Ahrens 2006 a). Additionally, they share with Ablaberini some plesiomorphies, which are not encountered anymore in the Old World lineage, such as the contiguous mesocoxae or the presence of two terminal mesotibial spur s. In this context, testing the monophyly of the genus group taxa of South American Sericini based on a more representative sample of the diversity of the group, with attention to the generic type species as a nomenclatural reference, represents an unprecedented and informative effort in their systematics. Nevertheless, a phylogenetic incursion on a group such as the Sericini tribe relies on detailed revision of the alpha taxonomy of their genera, given their poor revisional status and significantly underestimated diversity. Given that this group holds several crop pests, this comprehensive taxonomic treatment yield also more practical and applied outcomes for pest management. In this context, this thesis intended to work on these two fronts - taxonom y and phylogeny - in order to fill an important knowledge gap in the systematics of this still little known scarab chafer group.", "CHAPTER ONE", "Non-feeding discovered in Sericini chafers (Coleoptera, Sca rabaeidae): new genus from Amazonia and its phylogenetic position Thaynara L.

Here we briefly characterized all genera included in South American Sericini fauna per a key of identification. Manuscript submitted to Zoological Journal of Linnean Society .", "Abstract Here we examine outstanding scarab species discovered from two localities in the Amazonian Basin. We used comparative morphology and phylogenetic analysis to infer their systematic placement. A parsimony -based phylogenetic analysis was performed using 108 morphological characters from adults and larvae. Taxon sampling represented most ‘traditional’ subfamilies of coprophagous and phytophagous Scarabaeidae. Given the apparent presence of some morphological key characters, we emphasized on Sericini and other melolonthinae lineages in order to assess as accurately as possible their systematic placement. Phylogenetic analysis revealed them to be part of the clade of South American Sericini and to represent a new genus which was distinctive in several apomorphies : Parasymmela gen. n. We were able to distinguish two separate species, Parasymmela amazonica sp. n. and P. howdeni sp. n. The strong reduction of mouthparts in Parasymmela led us to assume that it represents the first non -feeding taxon among the megadiver se tribe Sericini which is discussed in the light of the evolutionary biology and feeding behavior of all phytophagous scarab lineages. For the South American Sericini, repeatedly retrieved as sister to all other Sericini, the subtribe Astaenina Burmeister , 1855 (type genus: Astaena Erichson, 1847) is re -established (currently in synonymy with Sericina Kirby, 1837).", "Key words. South America, chafer beetles, phylogenetic analysis, new genus, new species, feeding behavior.", "Introduction", "The mode of feeding played a crucial role in the evolution and diversification of scarab beetles (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae) (Ahrens et al. 2014d). While one major lineage (pleurostict scarabs) diversified as follow up with the successful angiosperms as phytophages, the other (Scarabaeinae+Aphodiinae) had a significant shift to feeding on mammal dung, whose availability was again resulted of the successful follow -up of mammals with the successful angiosperms (dos Reis et al. 2012). Despite alternative hypotheses regarding an earlier origin of dung feeding ( e.g., Gunter et al. 2016), a recent", "calibrated beetle tree seem to confirm the hypothesis of a mammal follow -up (McKenna et In contrast to other phytophagous beetles ( e.g., weevils, longhorn beetles), phytophagous scarabs are little specialized on their host plants. They each feed on a vast range of hosts, and their diversity is thus not explainable by an arms race with their host (Ahrens et al. 2014 d). Besides their generally larger body size, phytophagous scarabs (pleurosticti) all share strongly sclerotized mouthparts with stron g teeth at maxillary galea and extended molar zones at the mandibles. A few lineages (Ahrens et al. 2014 d) further adopted pollen feeding, which is reflected also in mouthpart morphology (Nel & Scholtz 1990). Adaptations linked to these feeding traits are recognizable also in species' morphospace, i.e., their general body shape (Eberle et al. 2014). Feeding and subsequently plant -released kairomones for many species play a crucial role for their chemical communication and mate -finding mechanisms ( e.g., Leal 1998; Ruther et al. 2002; Subaharan et al. 2013). Many species possess morphological adaptations to ensure copulation also while feeding. For example, to fix females best during copulation, males possess asymmetric tarsal lobes, or robust genital claspers and a short hook at phallobasal operculum (see e.g., Ahrens 2006 a). Non-feeding in adult specimens is rather rare among pleurostict chafers. While there is a number of species in which adults feed facultatively, without that mouthparts get reduced, there are very few examples, in which non -feeding among adults is obligatory. In many of these also the mouthparts are strongly reduced (Table 1). Sericini are one of the most diverse tribes of pleurostict chafers including around 4000 described species. Non -feeding never have been observed. The tribe has a nearly cosmopolitan distribution (not occurring on poles and in Australia) and had a Cretaceous origin in the West Gondwana with repeated dispersion out of Africa and is one of the oldest extant chafer lineage s (Ahrens et al. 2014 d; Eberle et al. 2017a; McKenna et al. 2019). The Neotropical Sericini are the sister clade of all other Sericini, both lineages were separated at circa 100 Mya (Eberle et al. 2017a). Most part of the recent systematic work on the trib e focuses on the Old World Sericini ( e.g., Ahrens 2004; Ahrens et al. 2016; Ahrens & Bezdek 2016; Fabrizi & Ahrens 2014; Fabrizi et al. 2019a, b, 2021; Liu et al. 2019; Eberle et al. 2017b; Rössner & Ahrens 2004). The knowledge about the Neotropical lineages is very limited (Frey 1973). This includes the scarce knowledge of biodiversity in the number of species, distribution, and ecology and so far Neotropical taxa represent only 5% of total Sericini species richness.", "In a comprehensive taxonomic treatment of South American species (Pacheco et al. 2020, 2021), a few outstanding specimens were discovered for two localities of the Amazonian Basin. We recognized these specimens as two new species which are herein described. Using comparative morphology and phylogenetic inference, we attempt in this study to infer the systematic position of these new enigmatic species. The strong reduction of their mouthparts leads us to assume that these t axa do not feed. This discovery could improve our understanding of the evolution of these scarab beetles, and of Sericini in particular, which is discussed in the context of other observed non -feeding cases in Scarabaeoidea and in the light of the historic al patterns of the evolution of the Amazon region.", "Material and methods", "Phylogenetic analysis", "Terms and methods used for measurements, specimen dissection and preparation of genitalia follow Ahrens (2004, 2006 a). The data matrix was assembled in Mesquite version 3.61 (Maddison & Maddison 2018). The matrix for cladistic analysis is based on the data published by Ahrens (2006 a) and was slightly extended to include all Neotropical Sericini genera. Now it contains 1 08 morphological characters of external and genital morphology of adults and larvae (2 characters more compared to Ahrens (2006 a)). Inapplicable characters were coded as ‘ -’, whereas unknown character states were coded as ‘?’(following Strong & Lipscomb 19 99). The parsimony analysis was run in TNT (Goloboff et al. 2004) with ten ratchet iterations. In a first run, all characters were run equally weighted and non -additive. Subsequently, we performed parsimony searches using implied weighting (Goloboff 1993) as implemented in TNT (k=3). Branch support (symmetric resampling) was calculated with 100 replicates (change probability: 33) (Goloboff et al. 2003). Character changes were mapped on the consensus tree using WINCLADA (Nixon 2002).

A short discussion of non -feeding in scarabs appear to be worthwhile in order to highlight the importance of the record of these two non -feeding Sericini species", "in the Amazon region. Among scarabs, we may distinguish between facultative non -feeding and obligatory non -feeding. While the first have fully developed mouth parts, the latter show a number of reductions as a consequence of the omission of feeding.", "Most of the records of the facultative non -feeding scarabs are from the postglacially reoccupie d areas such as central Europe, and a few others, for the biodiverse areas of the world (the few registered cases for the latter, could be due to the difficult detection of non - feeding since species biology is not well known). While there seem to be no rec ognizable patterns for facultative non -feeding scarabs, obligatory non -feeding can be observed commonly in somehow relict, partly even ancient lineages which often contain only a very few species (e.g., Diphyllostoma , Pleocoma , Pachypus , see also Table 1). Often such relics are found in areas with temperate climate but stable climatic conditions (such as the southern part of the continents (southern South America and South Africa, Australia), or Mediterranean islands ( Pachypus ; Crovetti 1969; Eberle et al. 2019b). Non -feeding is also often associated with loss of capacity of flight in at least one sex (female). We assume that many of such non -feeding cases have not yet been recorded as such (due to lack of knowledge of species biology and of examination of m outhparts) and neither their phylogenetic position is likely being addressed appropriately in order to recognize them as isolated or relic lineage (Eberle et al. 2019a). However, according to our present knowledge (which we suppose is very fragmentary) the case of a non -feeding Amazon species would not necessarily fit into that pattern of preferred occurrence of such non -feeding scarab species. Furthermore, since type series was only composed in both recorded species only of male specimens, we hypothesize t hat females are strongly restricted in their mobility. The very interesting fact about this genus is that all specimens of the type species, Parasymmela amazonica sp. n., were found in feces of the cervid species Mazama gouazoubira (Fischer von Waldheim, 1 814) which is, in contrast to the newly discovered Parasymmela , widely distributed in South America. Given the strong Latin American dung beetle scientists and collector community, it is very unlikely that the species is really associated with dung, but ra ther geographically restricted and occasionally found together feces. Mouth parts strictly exclude a feeding of adults on dung. One other only case among other supposedly dung -feeding melolonthines is in Sparrmannia flava Arrow, 1917, where the saprophagou s larvae (!) (but not the adults) feed on antelope dung in desert habitats (Scholtz 1988). This could be also the case for the larvae of Parasymmela , but without further data in both cases, we can only speculate.", "Morphology of mouth parts of Parasymmela suggest clearly that both species are non - feeding: galea without teeth or soft -skinned lobes for particle filtering; all setae on ventral side of labrum reduced; mandibles reduced in size and with small molar lobe.", "Currently the new genus is resulting to be closely related to Symmela , which would suggest a rather young age compared to all other South America Sericini genera (i.e., Astaenina). At the other hand, the number of autapomorphies of Parasymmela is considerable (some not included in this data set for phylogenetic analysis, see above) what makes a more basal position among Astaenina not unlikely. However, to resolve this question, a detailed molecular phylogeny is to be done under inclusion of all genera.", "The systematic position of Parasymmela gen. n.", "The systematic position of Parasymmela inferred by the morphology -based phylogenetic analysis is clearly within the southern American Sericini, while the support of the sister group relationship with Symmela is not too large (Bootstrap / Symmetric Resampling: 60/65, respectively). Parasymmela resulted to possess all synapomorphies of Sericini, including enlarged metacoxae, a filiform spiculum gastrale, the widely divided distal spines of metatibia, and the fused labroclypeus. None of the se characters is present in Aphodiinae which resemble at first glance considerably to Parasymmela in external appearance. The lineage of the South American Sericini was recovered as sister to all other Sericini (Ahrens 2006 a; Ahrens & Vogler 2008; Eberle et al. 2017a), therefore the subtribe Astaenina Burmeister, 1855 (Type genus: Astaena Erichson, 1847) should be re -erected (currently in synonymy with Sericina Kirby, 1837; Smith 2006).", "Although we used implied weighting and equal weighting for phylogeneti c analysis, we preferred the former to drive our principal conclusions. Implied weighting, a method for phylogenetic inference that actively seeks to down -weight supposed homoplasy, has in recent years begun to be widely utilized in phylogenetic analysis ( Goloboff 1993, 2014). However, Congreve & Lamsdell (2016) have shown that implied weighting is inconsistent in its ability to retrieve a known phylogenetic tree. Our equally weighted analyses were more conservative, retrieving higher number of polytomies ( Fig. 1). Equally weighted analyses seem less likely to generate erroneous topologies while implied weighting ( Supplementary Fig. 1) was reported to generally resolve polytomies while also propagating potential errors,", "resulting in an increase in both presu mably correctly and incorrectly resolved nodes with a tendency towards higher rates of error compared to equal weighting (Congreve & Lamsdell 2016). Tree topology from either analysis here is constant for the relationships of South American Sericini, which is why there are no further implications for the outcome of our study.", "Many of the outstanding apomorphies of Parasymmela are autapomorphies, with little impact on the resulting topology with the current sampling. Some of them, such as the shape of labroclypeus or the number of labial palpimeres were not included into the current dataset due to this reason. In this situation , morphology was unhelpful for the determination of the exact systematic placement of the new genus. Unfortunately, we failed to obtain through sanger sequencing DNA fragments of \"standard\" phylogenetic markers frequently used in the past for Scarabaeoidea (e.g., Ahrens et al. 2007, 2011, 2014 d; Bocak et al. 2014; Eberle et al. 2015, 2017a; Gunter et al. 2016; Hunt et al. 2007; Liu et al. 2015 b; Neita Moreno et al. 2019; Šípek et al. 2016; Ahrens & Vogler 2008), for a possible DNA based phylogenetic analysis.", "Acknowledgements We are grateful for the helpful comments on non -feeding scarabs from M.F.

We raise Sayloria Frey, 1973, a former subgenus of Symmela Erichson, 1835, to genus level, that includes three species. Our study results in the following new combinatio ns and synonymy: Sayloria bicoloripes (Saylor, 1946) comb. n. (= A. postnodata Frey, 1973 , syn. n .), S. abcora (Saylor, 1946) comb. n. (= A. apolinarmaria Saylor, 1946 , syn. n .) and S. pottsi (Saylor, 1946) comb. n.", "Keywords. Chafers, Sayloria , taxonomy, Neotropical region, South America.", "Introduction", "Sericini is a monophyletic tribe of chafers beetle with a nearly worldwide distribution, that is absent only in Australia and circumpolar regions (Ahrens 2006a; Eberle et al. 2017a). It comprises about 4000 species allocated in 200 genera (Ahrens 2006a). While Sericini are still generally poorly known in terms of their taxonomy and systematics, some significant progress has been made over the past two decades with hundreds new species of Sericini are being discoveries in Asia and Africa (e.g., Ahrens 2004a; Ahrens & Fabrizi 2016; Eberle et al. 2017b; Fabrizi et al. 2014, 2019a,b; Liu et al. 2019). However, South American species are still comparatively poorly known (Smith & Evans 2005). For South A merica, around 250 nominal taxa have been previously described. The latest comprehensive treatment was a synopsis of Frey (1973). But the recognition of most species is still very difficult since many species have been described based on female specimens a nd so far, comprehensive illustrations of species morphology are scarce.", "The systematic status of South American Sericini received, however, several important recent updates: several genera were excluded from Sericini [ e.g., Athlia Erichson, 1835 and Dihymenonyx Gutiérrez, 1949 are now allocated in Athliini (Smith & Evans 2018); Blepharotoma Blanchard, 1850 (Sericini according to Frey 1973) was transferred initially to Liparetrini (Evans & Smith 2005; Katovich 2008) but now to Seric oidini (Smith 2008)] or", "their synonymy was recognized with non -Neotropical Sericini genera being no more elements of Neotropic fauna [ e.g., Rhynchosymmela Frey, 1974 synonymized with Maladera (subgenus Hemiserica Brenske, 1894; Ahrens 2004b)]. Therefore, c urrently four genera are recognized for the Neotropics, Symmela Erichson, 1835, Astaena Erichson, 1847, Raysymmela Saylor, 1947, and Miotemna Lacordaire, 1856 (Evans & Smith 2005). This work is part of series studies with the goal to examine the type speci mens of Sericini species from South America, to designate lectotypes or neotypes, to redescribe them, to revise their taxonomic status, and to produce high -quality images from the type specimens and their labels. In this way, it will become possible to ens ure the identity of the species for future work, particularly to be able to recognize yet undescribed species, but also to make taxonomic information available for applied research including ecological, phylogenetical and biogeographical issues.", "Most parts of the South American Sericini species were described by German entomologists, housed at European collections (Evans 2003). However, a good number of species was described by Lawrence W. Saylor (1913 –1999; Ratcliffe 2016 ). During the stay of the first author (TLP) at United States National Museum, Smithsonian Institute, Washington D.C. (USNM) it was possible to loan and examine the Sericini type specimens described by Saylor from the Californian Academy of Sciences, and thus making possible the first part of this taxonomic revision. Here we revise the type material of the 18 species (fro m 19 species) of South American Sericini described by L.W. Saylor, providing redescriptions and systematic assessment of the species. Raysymmela huanuca Saylor, 1947 was not included on this work, it will be treated in the framework of a separate revision of this genus.", "Material and Methods", "Specimens studied for this work are all housed at the California Academy of Sciences, San Francisco, EUA (CAS).

Saylor, of which six of 18 are known only in female specimens. This represents nearly 35% of the species, which makes a comprehensive taxonomic treatment difficult since generally all species of Sericini are distinguish with the confidence only through the examination of male genitalia. Although external morphology, including shape and surface structure of head, pronotum, and elytra is relative stable in South American Ser icini compared to Old World Sericini lineages, the taxonomy of the species is complicate by the fact that sexual dimorphism is extreme in many species. Dimorphism is not only apparent in the shape of tarsi and pygidium, but also in body color and surface s heen, thus males and females of the same species are often not associated initially ( e.g., Sayloria abcora ).", "We were able to identify Sayloria Frey, 1973 as a separate genus based on a comprehensive and comparative preliminary review of morphological chara cters within South American Sericini (Pacheco et al. in preparation), exclusive hypothesized synapomorphies of Sayloria include mouthparts characters ( e.g., the deeply excised anterior margin of the mentum) and the absence of a robust lateral carina on abdominal ventrites. Given the high degree of homoplasy in many morphological traits of Sericini that make a generic systematic very difficult ( e.g., Ahrens 2006b,c; Ahrens & Vogler 2008; Liu et al. 2015 b; Frings et al. 2020), results from comparative morp hology will need to be supported by evidence from future molecular phylogenies.", "Acknowledgments We thank Christopher Grinter for the loan of the specimens from Californian Academy of Sciences (CAS), Eugenio Nearns for help with pic tures procedures and warm welcome at the Smithsonian Institution, Washington D.C.

Neotropical Sericini were so far revised only by Frey (1973), but since Saylor (1947 a) no additional species were added to the genus.", "In the present study, we revise the taxonomy of the genus Raysymmela and investigate the phylogeny of its species as well as their relationship to the other Neotropical Sericini genera with a phylogenetic analysis based on morphological characters.", "Material and methods", "Taxonomic revision", "Data from specimens examined are cited in the text with original label contents given in quotation marks, multiple labels are separated by a ‘/’. Measurements refer to the maximum extension of the specimen or the named structure. Diagnostic descriptions we re generated automatically from the Mesquite (Maddison & Maddison 2018) character matrix and then subsequently manually edited. For all male specimens genitalia were dissected and were glued to a pointed card and mounted on the same pin. Genitalia and habi tus of type specimens were photographed using a stereomicroscope a Zeiss AxioCam HRc mounted on a Zeiss Stereo Discovery V20 stereo -microscope or Leica M125 with a Leica DC420C digital camera. Image stacking used the automontage software as implemented in Leica Application Suite (v.3.3.0) or the software Zerene Stacker. The resulting images were subsequently digitally edited to eliminate the background on Adobe Photoshop CS3. Samples examined under the electron microscope were dehydrated by an ascending alc ohol series (with ethanol solutions of 50%, 70%, 90%, and 100%). The samples remained in each ethanol solution for five minutes and were then placed in an acetone filled vial for three minutes, subsequently air -dried on paper, mounted on pin stubs, and coa ted in a Cressington sputter coater (108 auto). SEM micrographs were taken with a Zeiss Gemini (SmartSEM, V05.00.05, SEM Type: Supra 55 VP).

The data matrix was assembled in Mesquite version 3.61 (Maddison & Maddison 2018). All valid species recognized to the genus Raysymmela was used in the analysis including the two new species. Also, we include two species of all Neotropical genera, two O ld-Word Sericini species as outgroup taxa, and a species ( Camenta innocua (Boheman, 1857)) of Ablaberini, the sister clade of Sericini, being used for rooting the resulting tree (Table 1). The final matrix comprised 21 species and 126 morphological charact ers of external and genital morphology (Table 2). Inapplicable characters were coded as ‘-’, whereas unknown character states were coded as ‘?’(following Strong & Lipscomb 1999). The parsimony analysis was run in TNT (Goloboff et al. 2004; Goloboff & Catal ano 2016) with ten ratchet iterations. All characters were run equally weighted and non -additive. Branch support (symmetric resampling and bootstrap) was calculated with 100 replicates in TNT (default settings) (Goloboff et al. 2003). Character changes wer e mapped on the strict consensus tree using WINCLADA (Nixon 2002). State transformations were considered to be apomorphies of a given node only if they were unambiguous (i.e. without arbitrary selection of accelerated or delayed optimization) and if they w ere shared by all dichotomized most parsimonious trees.

The consistency and retention index of the single characters is given along the character descriptions (Table 3).", "Our anal yses found Raysymmela to be not monophyletic, with at least three different lineages recognized within the genus: R. curtula , R. seticollis (both species in polytomy as sister to a clade Symmela/ Parasymmela Pacheco & Ahrens (in review) + other Raysymmela ), and all the other species so far assigned to Raysymmela (Figs 12, 13). This latter clade was sister to Symmela (including Parasymmela ) and supported by 10 synapomorphies, three of them being non -homoplasti c synapomorphies: the tridentate inner protarsal claws of the males, and the longer and strongly bent subparameres (characters 86, 124, and 125, respectively). Node support of this node was however lower than 50. Within this clade (we would refer to Raysym mela , sensu stricto, the type species R. bruchi , resulted in the strict consensus tree in a polytomy with R. huanuca , R. pallipes , R. erwini , and R. costaricensis . In the majority rule consensus tree, R. bruchi is sister to R. varians supported by the long er phallobase basal apodeme as apomorphy (character 114).", "Interior nodes of South American Sericini had generally low branch support (<50), except for the clade composed of the Raysymmela , Symmela , and Parasymmela lineages. Under the current sampling of t axa and characters, the older established genera ( i.e., Astaena Erichson, 1847 and Symmela ) probably also do not represent monophyletic lineages. Sayloria Frey, 1973 and Parasymmela represents monophyletic clades with high support values, however, nested within Symmela and Astaena , respectively.", "Discussion", "In regard of comparative morphology, two \"groups\" are diagnosable within the genus Raysymmela based on the presence or absence of a lateral carina on the abdomen and the shape of protarsal claws of male specimens (see couplet 1 of the key): (1) R. curtula + R. seticollis ; (2) Raysymmela sensu stricto including all other seven species recognized in the genus. Nonetheless, in a phylogenetic morphological -based context with the current taxon sampling (including a limited number of representatives of the other South American", "genera), only the latter group appears to be monophyletic. Results also revealed that the principal diagnostic character of the genus used by Saylor (1947 a) (i.e., the carina between penultimate ventrite and propygydium, character 71) is a plesiomorphic character. The lineages of R. cu rtula and R. seticollis could be placed in other, even new, genera, however, it is unknown yet, due to the low support values, whether both are sister species (representing a unique lineage), or not. Thus, further analyses including more information (i.e., molecular data and more taxa) are required to resolve the correct systematic classification of these species. So far, no molecular data are available neither for Raysymmela , nor for Symmela (Eberle et al. 2017 a). The polytomy of Raysymmela sensu stricto i n the strict consensus also might indicate the need of molecular data to resolve more robustly the relationships within the genus. However, interestingly the species of Raysymmela sensu stricto are all restricted to the Andean belt but being there widely d istributed from Costa Rica to northern Argentina, while R. curtula and R. seticollis are occurring only on the Brazilian shield.", "The current analysis, due its limited sampling species here, may not address the relationships of Astaena or Symmela , particularly in regard of the systematic position of the here included Sayloria and Parasymmela being both nested in one of the former gen era. Astaena or Symmela will be analyzed separately with appropriate taxon and character sampling. The current taxonomic revision revealed also extended blank areas between available findings where no record of Raysymmela exist. This might be a hint, there we might expect a much better insight to the genus' diversity and distribution when the fauna of these (supposedly) day active beetles will be better and appropriately explore. In fact, yet, our knowledge on the ecology of Raysymmela is near to zero. Spec imen labels do rarely provide any information on how/ (during which time of the day) the specimens were collected, just in one case there is for R. bruchi , ex. Inga flowers (Fabaceae), while several Raysymmela seticollis were collected with Malaise traps (and no records exist mentioning light traps). However, the small body size and the generally bicolored dorsal pattern, which is very common in many other day -active Sericini, might be a hint that all species share this li fe style which could be then explanation why they are so rare in collections since usually not captured during surveys of chafer assemblages with light traps.", "Thus, we see this contribution as a primer for future investigations based on specimens of more collections, and possibly to intensify the collection of these beetles also for molecular studies.", "Acknowledgements This work was supported by Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior (CAPES/PRINT) under grant 88887.368189/2019 –00 (TLP), Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico (CNPq) under grants 142383/2017 –1 (TLP) and 304318/2018 –3 (MLM), and German Science Foundation (DFG AH175/10 –1).", "CHAPTER FIVE", "The genus Symmela Erichson, 1835 (Coleoptera, Scarabaeidae, Sericini): taxonomy and phylogenetic analysis Thaynara L.

As a result of the revision, we propose the following new synonymies: Symmela longula Erichson, 1835 (= S. angustula Moser 1919 syn. n. ), Symmela nitida Erichson, 1835 (= S. tenella Erichson, 1835 syn. n. ). Fourteen new species are described: Symmela beskei sp. n. , S. capixaba sp. n. , S. clarki sp. n. , S. erichsoni sp. n. , S. fuhrmanni sp. n. , S. guerlini sp. n. , S. iannuzziae sp. n. , S. martinezi sp. n. , S. nunesorum sp. n. , S. paraguayensis sp. n. , S. pseudopaca sp. n. , S. reischei sp. n. , S. terezae sp. n. , S. unidentata sp. n.

South America, chafers, scarabs, beetles, new species.", "Introduction", "Symmela Erichson, 1835 was the first genus of Sericini erected from South America and it is one of six genera of Sericini occurring in South American (Pacheco et al. 2021; Chapter 1). The genus was based principally on the constitution of the antennal club being composed of only eight antennomeres (Erichson 1835). With the establishment of Raysymmela Saylor 1947 and Astaena Erichson , 1847, the lacking suture between propygidium and penultimate ventral abdominal ventrite became main diagnostic feature (Frey 1973). Originally, the genus included nine species (Erichson 1835). Further species were formally added by Gory few taxa it was removed from the genus to be relocated in the ge nus Raysymmela Saylor, 1947 ( Saylor 1947 ; Pacheco et al. ; Chapter 4). Since the last taxonomic revision of Frey (1973), who described a further single species, no additional species was added to the genus.", "Frey (1973) erected formally an additional subgenus of Symmela , S. (Sayloria ) Frey, 1973, which however, recently was erected to genus level (Pacheco et al. 2021). This work is part of a comprehensive treatment of the taxonomy of South American Sericini (Pacheco et al. 2020; 2021; Chapter 4). In the present study, we revise the taxonomy of the genus Symmela and investigate the phylogeny of its species as well as their relationships to the other Neotropical Sericini genera with a phylogenetic analysis based on morphological characters.", "Material and methods", "Taxonomic revision Data from specimens examined are cited in the text with original label contents given in quotation marks, multiple labels are separated by a ‘/’. Measurements refer to the maximum extension of the specimen or the named structure. Diagnostic descriptions we re generated automatically from the Mesquite (Maddison & Maddison 2018) character matrix and then subsequently manually edited. For all male specimens genitalia were dissected and were glued to a pointed card and mounted on the same pin. Genitalia and habi tus of type specimens were photographed using a stereomicroscope a Zeiss AxioCam HRc mounted on a Zeiss Stereo Discovery V20 stereo -microscope or Leica M125 with a Leica DC420C digital camera. Image stacking used the Automontage software as implemented in Leica Application Suite (v.3.3.0) or the software Zerene Stacker. The resulting images were subsequently digitally edited to eliminate the background on Adobe Photoshop CS3. Samples examined under the electron microscope were dehydrated by an ascending alc ohol series (with ethanol solutions of 50%, 70%, 90%, and 100%). The samples remained in each ethanol solution for five minutes and were then placed in an acetone filled vial for three minutes, subsequently air -dried on paper, mounted on pin stubs, and coa ted in a Cressington sputter coater (108 auto). SEM micrographs were taken with a Zeiss Gemini (SmartSEM, V05.00.05, SEM Type: Supra 55 VP).

The data matrix was assembled in Mesquite version 3.61 (Maddison & Maddison 2018). All valid species recognized to the genus Symmela was used in the analysis inclu ding the newly discovered species. Also, we include at least two species of all Neotropical genera, two Old -Word Sericini species as outgroup taxa, and a species (Camenta innocua ) of Ablaberini, the sister clade of Sericini, being used for rooting the resulting tree (Table 1). The initial matrix comprised 40 species and 137 morphological characters of external and genital morphology ( Supplementary Table s 1, 2). Inapplicable characters were coded as ‘ -’, whereas unknown character states were coded as ‘?’(fol lowing Strong & Lipscomb 1999). The parsimony analysis was run in TNT (Goloboff et al. 2004; Goloboff & Catalano 2016) with ten ratchet iterations. All characters were run equally weighted and non -additive. Branch support (symmetric resampling and bootstra p) was calculated with 1000 replicates in TNT (default settings) (Goloboff et al. 2003). Character changes were mapped on the strict consensus tree using WINCLADA (Nixon 2002). State transformations were considered to be apomorphies of a given node only if they were unambiguous (i.e. without arbitrary selection of accelerated or delayed optimization) and if they were shared by all dichotomized most parsimonious trees. Character states are described in Supplementary Table 2, as well the respective consistenc y and retention index of the characters.", "In a subsequent run, we excluded the characters with a retention index (Farris 1989) lower 0.2 and rerun all analysis in TNT again.

Despite the great amount of characters included into the analysis, the resolution of the obtained tree was initially far from being satisfying. Nearly half of the species resulted i n a polytomy in the strict consensus, and support of most branches, particularly also that of Symmela , were low. Several species with highly similar genitalia, such as S. mutabilis and S. clypeata or S. longula and S. nitida , did not group together. The hi gh amount of homoplasy among the characters have to be regarded as the principal reason, which is reflected by the low assemble consistency and retention index.", "In fact, after deleting the highly homoplasious characters from the data set using a filtering based on the retention index (Farris 1989), we obtained a tree with higher resolution and slightly better branch support. Some of the initially observed inconsistencies were still present, however, it might be also possible, that the observed similarity in genital morphology between S. longula and S. nitida is the result of convergence, although, in other Sericini groups this has not been observed among sets of more closely related lineages (Ahrens, pers. comm.).", "The distribution of the genus Symmela and th at of the genus Raysymmela (Pacheco et al. ; Chapter 4) are well differentiated. There is only very little overlap in the ranges of these two genera which are so similar in their general appearance and life traits (see also Pacheco et al.; Chapter 7). While Raysymmela is distributed mainly in the Andes, Symmela is mainly found so far on the Brazilian shield. Although the sampling density of both genera in the continent is not particularly high, we assume that this pattern is real. Representatives of both genera are expected to be collected with the same collecting techniques, and thus should have been collected together, if they do occur together. This appears very interesting, but about the causalities we may only speculate at this moment. More details about the species distribution are needed, and possibly also more robust species relationships along a time - calibrated phylogeny, to place patters of divergence in geological and paleoclimatical time scales and frameworks for further interpretation.", "The most ch aracters used here were those also used for the morphological characterization during taxonomic revisions of the group.

Here we examined all available type specimen s of the Neotropical species and performed a first phylogenetic analysis of known species with the aim to validate the current classification. The data matrix comprised 181 terminals and 163 characters of external and aedeagus morphology. Tree search used the parsimony ratchet and equal character weighting. A subsequent analysis was run excluding incompletely coded species (females) resulting in a reduced data set with 143 terminals. Current classification was not confirmed by the resulting trees: all major genera ( Astaena , Symmela , Raysymmela ) resulted to be not monophyletic. With the reduced taxa dataset, Miotemna was sister of all other Astaenina, Raysymmela and Symmela nested again within Astaena ; but Symmela and Raysymmela were monophyletic, the latter excluding, however, R. seticollis and R. curtula . Based on the coded characters we explored also disparity and found strongly contrasting general patterns compared to the obtained phylogeny. Approval of classification and hyp othesis testing in regard of evolutionary questions are in need of a molecular phylogeny, due to the resulting instable and weakly supported tree topology when based on morphology alone.", "Introduction", "Sericini are one of the most diverse tribes of pleuro stict chafers including around 4000 described species. The tribe has a nearly cosmopolitan distribution (not occurring on poles and in Australia). Its origin dates back to Cretaceous in West Gondwana land, thus Sericini is one of the oldest extant chafer l ineages (Ahrens et al. 2014 d; Eberle et al. 2017a; McKenna et al. 2019). Repeated dispersions out of Africa occurred versus Asia. The Neotropical Sericini, for which the name Astaenina Burmeister, 1855 was recently reestablished (Pacheco et al. ; Chapter 1 ), have been identified to be the sister clade of all other Sericin i, both lineages were separated at circa 100 Mya (Eberle et al. 2017a). Our knowledge about Neotropical Sericini is very limited (Frey 1973), so far Neotropical taxa represent only 5% of total Sericini species richness.", "In the framework of a comprehensive taxonomic treatment of the South American species (Pacheco et al. 2020, 2021 ), we examined all available type specimens and performed a first", "assessment of the phylogenetic relationships of all known species with the aim to investigate whether so far reco gnized genera represent monophyletic entities. In particular focus of our interest is the largest of the South American genera, the genus Astaena Erichson, 1847 which counts more than 140 valid species. In the past, several generic names have been synonymi zed with Astaena , such as Miotemna Lacordaire, 1856 or Temnostoma Blanchard, The species of Astaena are inconspicuous, elongate in body shape, relatively large (8 -16 mm), and have in general elongate legs. They are all supposedly night active, but detailed data on their ecology are not available. Based on the extracted morphological data of the examined type specimens, we attempt to reconstruct here the phylogeny of Astaena , in context of all South American Sericini species using parsimony as a first primer for a deeper systematic and taxonomic investigation of this diverse genus, i.e. a detailed taxonom ic treatment and revision which is in preparation.", "Material and methods", "Phylogenetic analysis Terms and methods used for measurements, specimen dissection and preparation of genitalia follow Ahrens (2004 a, 2006a). The data matrix was assembled in Mesquite version 3.61 (Maddison & Maddison 2018). All valid species recognized to the South American Sericini were used in the analysis. For a few species we were not able to examine the type specimens or any othe r confidentially determined specimens which were thus omitted from analysis. In order to test the influence of incompletely coded female type specimens on the tree topology, we coded for several taxa male and female specimens separately, particularly, when type series included only females. We included two Old -Word Sericini species as outgroup taxa, and a species ( Camenta innocua (Boheman, 1857)) of Ablaberini, the sister clade of Sericini, being used for rooting the resulting tree (see material examined in Supplementary Table 1). The original data matrix comprised 181 species and 163 morphological characters of external and genital morphology, of which 4 characters were excluded because they were uninformative. Thus, the final matrix used for analysis compr ised 159 characters (Table 1). Inapplicable characters were coded as ‘ -’, whereas unknown character states were coded as ‘?’ (following Strong & Lipscomb 1999). The parsimony analysis was run in TNT (Goloboff", "et al. 2004; Goloboff & Catalano 2016) with ten ratchet iterations. All ratchet analyses were repeated 20 times, to make sure that the possibly shortest tree was found. All characters were run equally weighted and non -additive. Branch support (symmetric resampling and bootstrap) was calculated with 100 0 replicates in TNT (default settings) (Goloboff et al. 2003). Character changes were mapped on the strict consensus tree using WINCLADA (Nixon 2002). State transformations were considered to be apomorphies of a given node only if they were unambiguous (i. e. without arbitrary selection of accelerated or delayed optimization) and if they were shared by all dichotomized most parsimonious trees. Character states are described in Table 2, as well the respective consistency and retention index of the characters.", "Since many species were present in female sex only lacking many characters of aedeagus, we performed a second tree search under the exclusion of taxa represented by females only. This dataset contained 143 taxa ( Supplementary Table 2).", "Finally, we confr onted the results of the phylogenetic analysis by a phenetic approach to infer whether discrete morphology (i.e. our character matrix) contains any alternative structure that could provide insight to possible natural entities, or even to the biology of the species (i.e., when grouping is based on plesiomorphies). Therefore, we investigated the morphological disparity from the discrete morphological characters of the examined species. For this purpose we exported the uncorrected distances in Mesquite (Maddis on & Maddison 2018), and performed on these a Principal Coordinate Analysis (Gower 2005) in PAST (Hammer et al. 2001) .", "Results", "Phylogenetic analysis", "We were able to extract from the investigated specimens 159 informative morphological characters and performed a parsimony tree search on them. This analysis resulted in a single most parsimonious tree with a length of 2847 steps (CI: 0.09, RI: 0.51). Despite the rather good resolution of the single tree, branch support of most nodes was po or (Figs 5-8). Support for internal nodes within Astaena Erichson, 1847 was generally lower than in the smaller genera Raysymmela Saylor, 1946, or Symmela Erichson, 1835, in which at least a few", "principal nodes had significant support. Only a few species pairs within Astaena resulted well-supported (but see below). Astaenina, i.e. the clade of Neotropical Sericini, was monophyletic, however, support of this nodes was poor and only with symmetric r esampling higher than 50 (62). All major genera, such as Astaena , Symmela , and Raysymmela resulted to be not monophyletic, the smaller genus level entities so far established ( Sayloria , Miotemna ) nested within Astaena . But also Symmela nested within Astaen a, a part of Raysymmela was nested within Symmela ; while the two species, Raysymmela seticollis (Moser, 1921) and R. curtula (Erichson, 1835) were placed on a pectinate hierarchical branches at the base of the clade Parasymmela (gen. n.) + Symmela (the lat ter including the rest of Raysymmela ). Many conspecific terminals, such as representatives of the two sexes, or taxa that have been previously or by our investigation recognized as synonyms (e.g., A. sulcatipennis (Blanchard, 1850) and A. fuscipennis Burme ister, 1855), were all monophyletic ( Figs 5-8).", "Homoplasy was high among the characters involved in the analysis, however, after filtering out all characters with ri<0.2 did considerably deteriorate the tree topology (results not shown here) towards a near -polytomy of most Astaena species and not better resolved Symmela and Raysymmela clades.", "The amount of lacking characters was considerable, since many specimens were known only by a female (type) specimen(s). However, the distribution of these terminals appeared not particularly clustered ( Figs 5-8), clades completely composed by female terminals were not encountered. Nevertheless, it was apparent that the pectinate and poorly resolved topology at the base of the all taxa tree ( Figs 5-8) showed numerous female terminals (but not exclusively). Therefore we also ran the tree search analysis in TNT on only male specimens (Supplementary Figs 1-3). The CI was slightly improved (CI: 0.11; RI: 0.5; TL: 2385/ 2 MPTs) which was likely due to the fact that we did not delete for this run the uninformative character s. In the resulting consensus tree ( Supplementary Figs 1-3) branch support was not much improved, but the topology in part significantly altered: The monophyletic Sayloria was one clade within Astaena . Miotemna was the sister of all other Astaenina, and Raysymmela , Symmela and Parasymmela nested again within Astaena . However, Symmela this time was monophyletic, Parasymmela its sister. Raysymmela was monophyletic except the two uncertain R. seticollis and R. curtula , which were in polytomy with Symmela + Parasymmela and Raysymmela .", "Given the little amount of coherence of the different Astaena clades resulting here (in terms of low branch support or clade stability) among the different analyses, as for example evident by the very different position of Miotemn a, we refrain here to discuss the topology of Astaena here more in detail.", "Homoplasy and possibly also incomplete character coding (many species had to be coded based only on partly poorly preserved type specimens) strongly hampered the tree reconstruction using parsimony. We had also no better outcome from additional analyses using implied weighting (results not shown), we performed a phenetic approach to infer whether any alternative entities are recognizable at all from morphology (i.e., even functional groups). Therefore, we plotted the morphological disparity inferred by Prin cipal Coordinate Analysis (PCoA). In contrast to the resulting phylogeny from the parsimony ratchet, PCoA revealed clearly two major well -defined entities (recognizable as well -distinct groups of dots): the first comprised Symmela and Raysymmela (i.e., diu rnal species), the second Astaena (including Miotemna ; i.e., nocturnal species). While Sayloria was situated at the margin of Astaena , Parasymmela was entirely off both major clusters along with the outgroups, Camenta Erichson, 1847, Omaloplia Schoenherr, 1817, and Pleophylla Erichson,", "Discussion", "The phylogeny on Astaenina presented here is the largest ever performed morphology -based phylogenetic analysis on Sericini. While only a few number of originally coded characters resulted to be uninformat ive, the amount of homoplasy was high (as expressed by very low CI value). The amount of lacking characters was considerable, since many specimens were known only by a female (type) specimens. Surprisingly, most species, for which we coded male as well as female specimens as separate terminals, specimens of the same species turned out also as monophyletic, which gives us good hope to \"reinterpret\" the species, which are only known as a female, and to assign likely correctly the conspecific males to the spec ies name. Nevertheless, using species known with males, results in a rather altered tree topology, which give us evidence for the limited robustness of the results. Some of the genealogical entities (i.e., nominal genera) were retrieved with more confidenc e from the males only approach, however, weak phylogenetic structure within the largest genus of Neotropical", "Sericini (i.e., Astaena ) makes it difficult to base supraspecific classification on morphology due to lacking robustness. Once again this shows, ho w crucial it is to include molecular in systematic and evolutionary research.", "While in external appearance, Astaena appear to form a rather well defined genus, the morphology -based parsimony tree represents it as a kind of collective group (based on plesiomorphies, at least when \"defining\" it based a plot as shown in Fig. 9 rather than by proper synapomorphies) in whic h supposedly ancestral characters are retained and that shape the phylogeny of the genus. This makes it difficult to derive further going conclusions on the classification of Astaenina, and particularly on Astaena based on morphology alone. However, integr ative exploration of alternative but phenetic evidence from the morphological characters analyzed here, results of the analysis of morphological disparity appear to \"rehabilitate\" Astaena , at least as a physiognomic entity which lacks, however, support fro m synapomorphies from parsimony based -phylogenetic analysis of so far available morphological data. Of course, we are aware of the general shortcomings of a distance -based, phenetic approach (e.g., Huson & Steel 2004), however, the integrativity and multid imensionality of using in this case distances (in form of a two -dimensional plot as an integral of many traits), suits perfectly to keep out the problems of a poorly resolved and supported tree topology in order to infer at least some preliminary and more robust patterns that can be translated into hypotheses in evolutionary biology.", "Most striking observation is that particularly within Astaena genital morphology is extremely uniform, a fact that is unknown for other Sericini but as well as Ablaberini. Eve n in Raysymmela and Symmela , species groups were evident from the complexly shaped genitalia, which are also reflected by the trees retrieved here. Usually, species groups in most Sericini can be easily recognized by clear and consistent synapomorphies (e. g., Ahrens 2005, 2006b,c, 2007, 2009, 2012; Eberle et al. 2017b), even in female genitalia (Özgül -Siemund Here, the observed patterns of disparity and the resulting phylogeny of Neotropical Sericini could be translated, cautiously - in con sideration of the weak branch support, into a hypothesis, in which diurnal lineages and species evolved once out of nocturnal lineages (Astaena ), without the latter had significant evolutionary change in ca. 100 Million years (i.e., the approximate age of origin of Astaenina; Eberle et al. 2017a). The low species diversity in Astaenina could reflect this as well.

Therefore, we compared in this work linear measurements of body features of Neotropical and Old World linages of Sericini chafers to uncover patterns possibly linked to fora ging behavior (day or night activity) or to the success of their diversification in terms of diversity. If diversity in Sericini chafers would be linked to morphological disparity, we would expect in the much less diverse Neotropical lineage a very clear d rop of morphological disparity. Comparing the two major sister clades, Old World and Neotropical Sericini, in terms of their disparity and diversity, the here elaborated distance data do not support the hypothesis that morphological disparity could be a d river for the diversity of Sericini in the Old World. The influence of the metacoxal length on morphological disparity, appears to represent a possible key for a better understanding of the evolution of Sericini in the Neotropical region (including their l ower diversity), and answer the question of why they are so much less diverse than their sister lineage in the Old World. The increasing length of the metacoxal plate appears to be a result of the presence of a secondary metacoxal joint in Old World Serici ni, which has a crucial impact on hind leg mobility and digging behavior. General body shape and single morphological characters appear under similar general evolutionary pressure: high morphometric disparity between nocturnal and diurnal Neotropical speci es was also corroborated by disparity estimated from discrete morphological characters.", "Key words: Niche, chafers, body shape, activities period, South America.", "Introduction", "Although the enormous diversity of host -specific herbivore insects is well explained by the hypothesis of an arms race between host plant and host (Ehrlich & Raven 1964; Mitter et al. 1991; Farrell 1998), the striking diversity among herbivorous Scarabaeoi dea is still poorly understood (Ahrens et al. 2014d; Eberle et al. 2014) since they are prevailingly polyphagous herbivorous. While follow -up diversification based on Angiosperm explosion and high survival rights are other explanations, particularly for be etle diversity (Hunt et al. 2007), these, however, do not apply for herbivorous scarabs. In the search for explanations for scarab diversity, ecomorphological analysis is one important tool to understand the", "coexistence between closely related species and to uncover important evolutionary traits of the organisms (Ricklefs & Miles 1994; Guillerme et al. 2020). Particularly morphological disparity may unveil hidden evolutionary patterns and causalities (Nel et al. 2018; Deline et al. 2018; Deline 2021) throug h the insight into the relative importance of genomic and ecological factors in macroevolution (Foote 1997). The study of the relationship of disparity vs species diversity may reveal interesting evolutionary correlations and causalities particularly, when the objects are to observe only with difficulty (Triantis et al. 2016; Copilaș -Ciocianu & Sidorov 2021) or not anymore, such as in fossils (e.g., Neige 2003; Ruta In scarabs, the use of morphological disparity, i.e. the estimate of the lineage’s occupancy of a suitably defined n -dimensional morphospace (Foote 1997; McGhee 1999; Wills 2001; Erwin 2007), have been demonstrated recently in several studies. Inward et al. (2011), for example, demonstrated differences of morphospace in different functional groups of feeding habits over various assemblages of dung beetles (Scarabaeinae), even in unrelated species or groups. Eberle et al. (2014) showed that some lineages wit h different feeding habits may not be distinguished by morphospace in Pleurostict scarabs, while others and several phylogenetic lineages can; they also found that the morphospace coevolved with some morphological key innovations regarding locomotion, part icularly in Sericini. Sericini are herbivore pleurostict chafer beetles with more than 4000 described species and a near cosmopolitan distribution (Ahrens 2006 a). It is one of the oldest extant chafer lineages (Ahrens et al. 2014d; Eberle et al. 2017a; Mc Kenna et al. 2019) that had its origin in the West Gondwana during Cretaceous with repeated subsequent dispersals out of Africa (Eberle et al. 2017a). The oldest split of Sericini is between an Old World and a Neotropical lineage, showing an extreme contra st in species diversity: the Old World lineage is about 20 fold more diverse.", "While most part of the recent taxonomic and systematic work on the tribe have focused on the Old World taxa, very little is known about the Neotropical lineage. This includes th e scarce knowledge on taxonomy (Frey 1973) as well as their diversity (i.e., number of species), distribution, and ecology. The findings of Eberle et al. (2014) were based on a few exemplar species, for which DNA data were available (Ahrens & Vogler 2008). However, we were interested whether their findings, particularly for the Sericini, are consistent with a more complete sampling of the fauna, especially of the poorly sampled Neotropics. Therefore, we compared in this work linear measurements of body feat ures of Neotropical", "and Old World linages of Sericini chafers taken routinely during taxonomic revisions to uncover patterns possibly linked to foraging behavior (day or night activity) or to the success of their diversification. If diversity in Sericini c hafers would be linked to morphological disparity, we would expect in the much less diverse Neotropical lineage a very clear drop of morphological disparity. In case that disparity and diversity are not linked, patterns would be random and not significantl y distinct.", "Material and methods", "We used six different body variables (Fig. 1), of which three comprised body ratios, and three were linear distance measurements. We analyzed data for four available (out of five) South American genera and nineteen Old -Word genera of Sericini chafers (main ly from Asia), represented so far by 108 and 736 species, respectively (list of examined species, see Supplementary Table 1). Data were taken from newly measured specimens (Pacheco et al. Chapter 6 ) and the following published taxonomic revisions (Ahrens & Fabrizi 2016; Ahrens et al. 2014a -c; Bohacz & Ahrens 2020a,b; Chandra et al. 2021; Eberle et al. 2017b; Fabrizi 2019; Ranasinghe et al. 2020; Sreedevi et al. 2018 , 2019).", "All measurements were taken with the help of an ocular grid on a stereomicroscope (we had in course of the years various models), and values were converted for the distance measurements to millimeters for the different magnifications. Measurements were taken in such a way that the endpoints were in focus. Rations were calculated directly from measured values.", "Obtained linear measurements were log10 -transformed to render more linear relations among variables and to obtain a similar dimension of vari ance (Ricklefs et al. 1981; Klingenberg 1996). Generally, the major component of variance in morphometric data sets of biological specimens is explained through size (Jolicoeur 1963; Burnaby 1966; Ferrario et al. 1995). However, since we consider size a cr ucial component of morphospace as well, we refrained to employ approaches that separate size from shape information (Eberle et al. 2014). Nevertheless, for a number of traits we used directly ratio measures, as these more directly infer some trait characte ristics (e.g., the general shape of a leg) and they have been therefore used since long in taxonomic works (e.g., Ahrens 1999, 2004 a).", "Patterns of morphometric covariation were analyzed with standard principal component analysis (PCA) on raw and log -norma lized data. Additionally, we omitted the total body length from the analysis to reduce the effect of overweighting overall body size. Euclidean distances between species were calculated directly from PC loadings, as means of general morphological disparity being subsequentially partitioned by lineage assignment or ecological groups (i.e., day activity habits). All calculations for the analysis of morphospace were made in PAST (Hammer et al. 2001), PC axes 1 and 2 were plotted with Excel. Pearson correlation of traits was calculated in Excel as well .", "Finally, we compared the disparity resulting from morphometric patters of the species, with the morphological disparity extracted from discrete morphological characters of the examined South American s pecies (from Pacheco et al. in prep.). For this purpose we exported the uncorrected distances in Mesquite (Maddison & Maddison 2018), and performed on these a Principal Coordinate Analysis (Gower 2005) in PAST.", "Results", "General trait variation While among the herbivorous scarabs, Sericini are generally smaller compared to the majority of species, the overall body size (length) varied considerably in our data, ranging from 3.6 to 14.7 mm (maximum width 2 to 9.8 mm). Infraspecific variation was, however , not considered here, since taxonomic treatments in Sericini (see Material and methods for references) provide in general a range of observed variation rather than induvial measure assessments (mainly due to time constrains and limited taxonomic value). A mong the here examined traits, the elytral length showed the strongest correlation with the total body size (Fig. 2) (r=0.94). The correlation between elytral length vs. body width (r=0.91), as well as total body size vs. body width (r=0.87), was slightly less tight. In contrast to that, none of the body ratios seemed to be very closely related to the body size (r=0.13, -0.05, 0.004, for BL vs. MTL/MTW, BL vs. ED/IOD, BL vs. MCL/MEL, respectively).", "Diurnal species with flower -visiting habits were found to be distinctly smaller, generally smaller than 7 mm. Night active taxa resulted to be generally larger (>7 mm). Other traits could not be revealed as particularly linked with the activity time, altho ugh diurnal species resulted to have always small eyes as well as relatively short and wide metatibiae. Night", "active species, which represent most of the species diversity of Sericini worldwide as well as in South America, showed a much wider variation. Ne otropical lineages showed not distinctly different patterns in morphospace. However, the length of the metacoxa (in relation to the length of metepisternum) is in the mean generally lower compared to the Old World taxa, although this difference is not pron ounced by a distinct gap (Fig. 3). The variation in all traits was largest in the most diverse but presumptively polyphyletic genera, Maladera and Neoserica (Ahrens & Vogler 2008; Liu et al. 2015b; Eberle et al. 2017a).", "Morphospace and disparity The plo ts of the most informative first two PC axes showed two slightly different pictures for raw data and log -normalized data, with the major difference that the overlap between diurnal and nocturnal species was reduced with the log -normalized data. When the to tal body length was excluded from analysis (Fig. 4B,D), results were similar to the complete data analysis. For the Neotropical genera, this led to a sharp separation between Astaena and Symmela/ Raysymmela in morphospace, while the morphospace of Symmela and Raysymmela widely overlapped. The Old World genera included in this analysis, which comprised in a large number of nocturnal lineages, had a rather pronounced overlap in morphospace (systematic (genus -level) specimen assignment not shown here in detail ). After log normalization, the different traits contributed in a different way to the patterns of morphospace. Elytral length (EL) and body maximum width (EW) had the greatest impact in all analyses on the morphospace ( Table 1), and for the all -raw data a nalysis also the total body length (BL). Interestingly, the first two had more impact in the log -normalized analysis than BL. Although being numerically of less impact, for the distribution of the species in morphospace also the other variables were highly important as it was visible from the vector loadings of the traits (Fig. 4), where coxal length (i.e., R: coxa) and metatibial proportions (i.e., R: metatibia) influenced the morphospace in orthogonal direction compared to the general length measures. The se vectors mainly explained the morphological divergence between Neotropical (i.e., Astaena ) and Old World, while the body size (EW, EL, BL) corresponds mainly to the divergence between diurnal and nocturnal forms, for normalized data also the size of eyes (R: eyes) became important.", "The general morphological disparity was measured also employing observed distances between the species, optionally partitioned by lineage assignment or ecological groups (i.e.,", "day activity habits). Compared to the mean and me dian distances between the species in morphospace, Neotropical taxa were generally above this value, while remainder Old World species were below that mean. This was the case for raw data as well as for normalized data. Maximum distances occurred, however, among the Old World species ( Table 2). We found contrasting results between raw and normalized data for diurnal activity patterns: while diurnal taxa are with raw data well below mean and median values, they are above with normalized data ( Table 3). When diurnal activity patterns were examined separately for Neotropical and Old World taxa ( Table 4), it became evident that Old World diurnal taxa were morphologically more despair than Neotropical ones, while nocturnal taxa did not differ in their morphologic al disparity in relation to their origin, although maximum distances always occurred among the Old World taxa.", "High morphometric disparity between nocturnal and diurnal Neotropical species was also corroborated by disparity estimated from distance data der ived based on discrete morphological characters. The latter showed a clear differentiation between the nocturnal Astaena species and the diurnal Raysymmela and Symmela species. The latter two genera, however, could not be clearly separated with the plots b ased on these characters (Fig. 5).", "Discussion", "Overall morphological appearance of all Sericini is highly similar and differentiation of many species by external features is difficult or impossible (Ahrens 2004 a). This extreme similarity, linked with a high degree of homoplasy of diagnostic characters, has also as a result that several of the current major genera are not monophyletic and that females are hard to classify to genus without any associated males (Ahrens 2004 a; Eberle et al. 2017a,b). Therefo re, morphometric methods seem to be particularly welcome to investigate the morphological disparity within this tribe.", "Our results corroborated some general correlation between body shape and the period of day activity, in which the major explaining varia ble of divergence is total length. Body measurements and daily activity patterns were found to be in correlation with body color, which was not assessed here by appropriate analysis but by background knowledge of the senior author and observations on the h ere examined specimens. Many of the diurnal species, beside of having a smaller in body size, show a particular bi -colored dorsal surface (with", "dark head and pronotum and yellow or reddish elytra with dark margin or spots), for example in the genera Symmel a and Raysymmela , but also the Asian Anomioserica , Microserica , and Oxyserica . This color pattern resembles a mimicry (Pasteur 1982; Mallet & Joron 1999) encountered also in many Lycids (e.g., Motyka , et al. 2018, 2021; Bocek et al. 2019), blister beetles, or leaf beetles (Bocakova et al. 2016; Bocak & Yagi 2010).", "The influence of the metacoxal length on the observed morphological disparity (Fig. 4) appears to represent a possible key for a better understanding of the evolution of Ser icini, in general but particularly for the Neotropical region, and answer the question of why the Neotropical lineages are so much less diverse than their sister lineage in the Old World. The increasing length of the metacoxal plate appears to be a result of the origin of a secondary metacoxal joint in Old World Sericini (Ahrens 2006 a; Eberle et al. 2014) which has a crucial impact on hind leg mobility and digging behavior (Eberle et al. 2014). This hypothesis was confirmed here by all Neotropical taxa havi ng consistently shorter metacoxa lacking the secondary metacoxal joint. The metacoxa in the latter is often even shorter than the metepisternum which in Old World lineages never occurs. However, this complex question needs further investigation, as Macroda ctylini, being of similar body size as Sericini but much less diverse in the Old World, kind of replace the more rare Sericini in the new World in terms of diversity and dominance in most species assemblages (e.g., García -López et al. 2010, 2012; Cherman 2 011; Kirmse & Ratcliffe 2019; Morón -Ríos & Morón 2001; Morón - Ríos et al. 2003, Pardo -Locarno 2013; García Atencia 2014; López -García et al. 2015), despite their considerably younger age (Ahrens et al. 2014 d).", "Comparing Old World and Neotropical Sericini in terms of their disparity and diversity, the here elaborated distance data do not support the hypothesis that morphological disparity could be a driver for the diversity of Sericini in the Old World. The lacking clear disparity within assemblages, in contr ast to dung beetles assemblages (Inward et al. 2010), was reason why Eberle et al. (2014) hypothesized a lack of competition among adult chafer beetles. However, as shown here, the feeding trait, such as herbivory, might not be sufficient to promote morpho logical disparity, especially when the herbivory is little host specific as in most scarab chafers.", "In contrast to that, lineage -specific correlation between disparity and diversity was reported for many other organisms, e.g., Mindel et al. 2016; Neustupa et al. 2009; Gerovasileiou et al. 2015; Zhang et al. 2020; Tong et al. 2020, 2021). In some cases correlation was evident only at higher systematic level, but not at species level (Tong et al. 2021) or among ecotypes", "(Tong et al. 2020). Thes e results, however, are to be considered with caution since their measure of diversity was often the number of sampled taxa (that was partly very incomplete in respect to the true diversity of the lineage), and no phylogenetic correction was performed (Garland 1992).", "Due to the present lack of a robust (i.e., molecular) phylogenetic hypothesis for Neotropical Sericini (Eberle et al. 2017a), we were limited here to a rather simple comparative approach that did not consider phylogeny. A consideration of the l atter would be useful in order to correct for the dependency of the signal due to the genealogical relationship of examined lineages as performed by phylogenetic contrast analysis (Garland 1992; McPeek 1995). Comparisons should consider therefore principal ly well -known sister clades, or functional groups (e.g., ecotypes) that are anyway not supposed to be related.", "Lacking phylogenetic data for the Neotropical lineages, conclusions we could make were limited. On the other hand, many Old World lineages from tree topology of Eberle et al. (2017) are still in process of taxonomic discovery as well, thus our numbers of species diversity for defined clades is in many cases rather preliminary too. Only the most recent work on Chinese Maladera species brought out m ore than 150 species (Fabrizi et al. 2021), which equals the total fauna of Neotropical Astaena .", "Nevertheless, some initial signals of evidence regarding disparity between Old World Sericini and Neotropical ones but also between diurnal and nocturnal speci es became evident here. The fact, that this latter disparity was corroborated by disparity estimated from discrete morphological characters (Fig. 5), indicates that general body shape and a majority of morphological characters appear under similar general evolutionary pressure. This may point the directions for future investigations, not only for Sericini, but all evolutionary and synecological research of pleurostict chafers in the light of their follow -up evolution with Angiosperms (Ahrens et al. 2014 d), in which the investigation of the phylogenetic relationships in much as possible detail remains a crucial part.", "Acknowledgements", "This work was supported by Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior (CAPES/PRINT) under grant 88887.368189/2019 -00 (TLP), Conselho Nacional de", "Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico (CNPq) under grants 142383/2017 -1 (TLP), 304318/2018 -3 (MLM), and German Science Foundation (DFG AH175/10 -1).", "GENERAL CONCLUSIONS", "This thesis investigated the taxonomy and phylogenetic relationships of Neotropical Sericini and attempted to develop, based on a simple morphometric analysis, further conclusions on the evolutionary biology of the group. The thesis structured into seven c hapters all being in process of submission as single separate publications. Results are based on the examination of the type specimens of 150 species.", "First, we performed a test of the monophyly of the Southern American genera of Sericini in the wider con text of all pleurostict chafers and investigated the systematic placement of a newly discovered first non -feeding lineage of Sericini (chapter 1) which is characterized by a number of synapomorhies that are very divergent from related species, and many of these are related to non -feeding, but not all. Chapter 2 excluded a few taxa described as Astaena Erichson, 1847, which are either not part of the Neotropical fauna (due to incorrect collection labels of the type specimens), or which belong to another tribe. Chapter 3 presented a first part of the taxonomic revision of the large genus Astaena includin g the species described by Saylor, which lead to two new species synonymies and 3 new combinations. Sayloria (the former subgenus of Symmela ) it was elevated to genus level. Chapters 4 and 5 investigated the taxonomy and phylogeny of the genera Raysymmela Saylor, 1947 and Symmela Erichson, 1835. In chapters 1 -5 one new genus, Parasymmela gen. nov. , and 18 new species were discovered. Species distribution revealed distinct biogeographical patters between Raysymmela and Symmela . Based on the results from thes e chapters and the examination of all remaining available type specimens of the genus Astaena , we performed the largest ever performed morphology -based phylogenetic analysis of Sericini which included nearly all Neotropical species (chapter 6). Given the l arge amount of discovered presumptive new species of Astaena among the examined unidentified material of different museums and institutional collections, the monographic conclusions of the morphological and taxonomical investigations had to be postponed an d could not be included into this thesis. The topology of phylogenetic analyses contrasted in many cases current classification: While in the separate analysis (Chapter 5) under inclusion of a few extra -generic members of Neotropical Sericini, Symmela resulted monophyletic, it did not in the all -taxa analysis. Astaena and Raysymmela in none of the analyses resulted monophyletic. Parasymmela resulted as sister to Symmela in most analyses. Since many species of Astaena were known only in female sex, the codin g of the all -taxa analysis was rather incomplete. The topology", "of a male -only phylogeny of the all -taxa set was strongly altered, underlining the poor branch support and clade stability, which makes it very difficult to draw conclusions regarding the class ification of these results, particularly for Astaena . At least Symmela turned out under latter sampling again monophyletic. Resulting all -taxa tree topology (chapter 6) was compared furthermore with the disparity between genera derived from the same discre te morphological characters: this phenetic approach distinctly captured Astaena as distinct morphological entity allowed two principal hypotheses: 1) phenotypic patterns of disparity represent mainly plesiomorphies and Astaena is a collective non -monophyle tic group that is conserved in its morphological properties since its origin (i.e., the origin of Astaenina, ca 100 Mio years ago), or 2) the parsimony -based tree reconstruction (at least the all taxa tree) does not reflect true relationships. Lacking bran ch support and clade stability, likely a result of high homoplasy and the number of incompletely coded terminals particularly in Astaena , would rather support the latter hypothesis. However, a distinct reduction of taxa in the dataset for Astaena did not b ring improvements, neither for support nor for topology (i.e. monophyly of Astaena/ Raysymmela ).", "Finally, these observed patterns of disparity among Neotropical genera, were confronted with shape disparity derived from routinely taken measures during taxon omic characterization, and compared with available data of the much more diverse Old -World lineages (chapter 7). Comparing the two major sister clades, Old World and Neotropical Sericini, in terms of their disparity and diversity, the here elaborated dista nce data do not support the hypothesis that morphological disparity could be a driver for the diversity of Sericini in the Old World. The influence of the metacoxal length on morphological disparity, appears to represent a possible key for a better underst anding of the evolution of Sericini in the Neotropical region (including their lower diversity), and answer the question of why they are so much less diverse than their sister lineage in the Old World. General body shape and single morphological characters appear under similar general evolutionary pressure: high morphometric disparity between nocturnal and diurnal Neotropical species was also corroborated by disparity estimated from discrete morphological characters.", "The presented thesis represents the first comprehensive taxonomic revision on the species of Neotropical Sericini in the past nearly 50 years. The type material of the species was comprehensively illustrated, species records mapped, the species comprehensi vely redescribed, and cladistic analyses performed based on available morphological evidence. Although results of resulting phylogenies appear not very satisfying, at least for the all -taxa", "approach, the comprehensive treatment of the species represents a very important primer for future systematic research on the tribe in South America but also for general ecological research on herbivore chafers, in which Sericini remained always unconsidered. The thesis delivered hypotheses on the evolution of Neotropica l Sericini to test in future with more robust molecular phylogenies, for which however, at the moment suitably conserved specimens are lacking. The improved taxonomic knowledge of Neotropical Sericini will help to further gain ecological knowledge through chafer assemblage composition analyses and improved knowledge of larvae. The thesis showed, how even in short time to mobilize with \"traditional methods\" important taxonomic knowledge through combination of human potential, expert knowledge, access on rele vant collection resources, and moderate funding in order to overcome the taxonomic impediment.", "REFERENCES", "Ahrens, D.

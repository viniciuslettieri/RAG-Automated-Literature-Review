The increasing demand for drilling, production, transportation and storage of oil and its derivatives have led to catastrophic oil spills, with severe economic, environmental and social eff ects. In this work, two fluorine -free, superhydrophobic/superoleophilic polymeric coatings were developed, characterized, and successfully used for oil/water separation, besides exhibiting excellent adhesion properties, and high thermal stability.

Introduction", "1.1. Energy outlook", "The global population growth and economic development has led to an increasing demand for energy. According to a recent report, the world energy consumption in 1994 was slightly above 350 EJ, whereas in 2019 it increased to nearly 580 EJ (Figure 1.1).1 Such a significant increase was followed by a massive investment, technology development, and growing of the renewable energy sector. Despite the fact th at renewable energies reached approximately 5 % of the global energy consumption in 2019, oil and natural gas accounted for over half of the global market share, maintaining a decades -long trend.", "Figure 1. 1. World consumptio n of energy in exajoules (left) and percentages (right).1", "In fact, fossil fuels have been the engine of the world for many decades. This is associated with the widespread use of oil and gas for transportation, besides a number of industrial, commercial and residential applications.2,3 In the United States, the rise of oil and gas t races back to the early 1900s. Along with coal, these fossil fuels have provided more than 80 % of the total U.S. energy consumption for more than 100 years.4 The Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory reported that oil and gas were the two sources of energy most consumed in the countr y in 2019, representing 36.7 and 32.1 % of the total, respectively.5 The same report shows that solar, wind, hydro and geothermal energies together represent only about 6.5 % of the total in 2019. These numbers demonstrate the unparalleled hegemony of oil and gas for the world’s largest eco nomy in the 21st century. The trend of the fossil fuel consumption dominance is also common for most of developed and developing countries, as well as for geopolitical groups like BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa).1 For the past years, Brazil has had one of the leading positions in the use of renewable energy sources.6 According to the Brazilian Ministry of Mines and Energy, the country had a 41 % participation of renewable sources in its energy production in 2019,7 what is significantly higher than the global average of 11 %.8 The two major contributors for such a high share were the use of ethanol derived from sugarcane,9 and the generation of hydraulic energy, mostly originated from the Itaipu Dam.10 Nevertheless, like the United States, oil and gas still accounted for over half of the energy production in Brazil not only in 2019, but also in the past decades.", "Based on a complex mode l of population, demographics, economic growth, energy policy, technology and innovation, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) recently published a forecast of global energy demand for 2045 (Table 1.1).11 According to this study, renewable energies other than biomass and hydro wil l have the highest growth in the period (6.6 %), resulting in a fuel share increase from 2.1 to 8.7 %. However, the already expressive production levels of oil and gas in 2019 will increase 8.5 and 24.3 mboe/d by 2045, representing a fuel share of 27.5 and 25.3 %, respectively. In other words, although the renewable energies are experiencing a significant growth, it is expected that oil and gas will remain the two major energy sources for the entire world in the coming decades.

Relevance of offshore drilling, production, and transportation of oil and its derivatives The year 2017 marks the 70th anniversary of the first commercial offshore oil well drilled by a mobile rig out -of-sight of land . This well, completed in 1947 at a depth of about 5 meters off the coast of Louisiana in the United States, was the start of a new chapter for the global oil and gas industry. Since then, operators have mo ved progressively further and deeper in search of exploration and production opportunities, aided and accompanied by rapid technological advances.12 In general, the cost of the offshore operations are significantly higher than the onshore ones. However, the operational cost can be justified by the high productivity and the longevity of the oil and gas reserve s found offshore. As a result, the progress of offshore oil and gas exploration has progressed over the years.", "Today, offshore oil and gas represents a multi -billion -dollar industry, and many countries around the globe have developed their energy infrastru cture with an expressive participation of this resource. Figure 1.2 shows the global crude oil production in the period of 2005 -2015.13 The global production has slightly increased, and the offshore crude oil participati on accounted for nearly 30 % of the global oil production throughout the period. Interestingly, a significant amount of global offshore production is concentrated in just a few countries. In 2015, five countries provided 43 % of total offshore oil producti on: Saudi Arabia, Brazil, Mexico, Norway, and the United States.", "Figure 1. 2. Global crude oil production (top), and global offshore crude oil production by country (bottom) .13", "As the secon d largest offshore oil producer in the world, Brazil plays a very important role in the development of deepwater (125 -1,500 meters), and ultra -deepwater (more than 1,500 meters) exploration. Production of crude oil in Brazil increased in recent years as pr oducers targeted large, offshore, pre -salt oil deposits. Brazil’s pre -salt oil production in 2016 reached a record 1.02 million b/d, surpassing the 2015 production level by 33 %. Pre-salt oil deposits are located offshore under deep, thick layers of rock a nd salt and require substantial investment to extract. The depths and pressures involved in pre -salt production present significant technical hurdles. Despite these challenges, however, pre -salt crude oil production in Brazil has increased significantly si nce it began in 2009.14 When evaluating the proved oil and gas reserves in Brazil, the relevance of the offshore fields becomes quite obvious (Figure 1.3). Strengthened by the exploration of the pre-salt oilfields, the vast majority of the oil and gas reserves are located offshore, representing 96 and 81 % of the total in 2018, respectively. According to the Brazilian National Petroleum Agency (ANP), the offshore proven reserves are heavily concen trated in the state of Rio de Janeiro, which account for 86.4 and 77.1 % of the total offshore oil and gas fields, respectively.15 For this reason, Petrobras, a state -owned oil producer and Fortune 500 company is strategically headquartered in the city of Rio de Janeiro.16", "Figure 1. 3. Proved oil (left) and ga s (right) reserves in Brazil. Blue: offshore; Green: onshore.15", "The United States is the fifth offshore crude oil producer in the globe.13 Figure 1.4 shows the proved crude oil and gas reserves in the United States. Until 2008, the Federal Offshore reserves (Pacific and the Gulf of Mexic o) accounted for approximately 25 -35 % of the oil reserves in the U.S. After 2008, that contribution relatively decreased due to large onshore discoveries in the states of Texas, New Mexico, and Oklahoma, which more than doubled the U.S. oil reserves.17 Nevertheless, the Federal Offshore reserves still play an importa nt role in the U.S. energy supply. In 2019, about 15.5 % of U.S. crude oil was produced from wells located offshore in the federally administered waters of the Gulf of Mexico.18 Moreover, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management estimated a mean of 90.5 billion barrels of undiscovered, technically and economically recoverable offshore oil, where 53 % is located in the Gulf of Mexico.19 These findings highlight the relevance of the Federal Offshore re serves for the future of the nation’s energy security and economy.", "While 71 % of total U.S. crude oil reserves are located in only five states (Texas, North Dakota, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and California), the gas reserves have a wider geographical distribut ion throughout the country.17 However, the Federal Offshore res erves do not account for a significant share, as illustrated in the Figure 1.4.", "Figure 1. 4. Proved crude oil (left) and gas (right) reserves in the United States.17", "Besides the expressive offshore production in the globe, a vast amount of oil and gas refined products such as gasoline, d iesel, and kerosene, as well as various intermediate streams are transported by tankers and barges via fluvial or maritime routes. International transportation on these routes allows for imports and exports, while domestic transportation takes part in a co mplex logistic configuration for distribution of chemicals in different regions. The development of logistics infrastructure is crucial for maintaining oil trading, exporting capacity and the availability of products to markets. This is why signif icant int erregional develop ments have major impacts on oil flows and are considered among the key inputs for modelling of global trade movements.11 As a reference, ANP recently reported that the storage capaci ty of oil and refined products in Brazilian fluvial and maritime terminals is approximately 255,000 and 9,288,000 m3, respectively. Excluding Central and South American countries, where transportation to/from Brazil can be done by terrestrial modes, import s of refined product were 17.8 million m3, while exports were approximately 12.2 million m3 in 2018.15 In the U.S., the 50 states and the District of Columbia are divided into five Petroleum Administration for Defense Districts (PADDs), which helps the Energy Information Administration (EIA) to analyze patterns of oil and refin ed products movements throughout the nation (Figure 1.5). EIA reports that more than 408 million barrels of crude oil and refined products were transported in between PADDs specifically by tankers and barges in 2019. Almost 75 % of that value was from PADD 3 (Gulf Coast) to PADD 1 (East Coast), where big urban centers like New York City, Philadelphia, Jacksonville, Washington, and Boston are located.20,21 Trade movements of crude oil, intermediate s and refined products are crucial elements of the global economy and are responsible for the integration of different regions and mutual development . OPEC reports that the g lobal interregional oil flow are projected to increase from 56.5 mb/d in 2019 to 63.2 mb/d in 2045.11 With the increased volume and flux of oil, comes an increased risk of oil spills, and an urgent need of enhancing safety protocols, developing more effective methods, and materials for environmental remediation.", "Figure 1. 5. The Petroleum Administration for Defense Districts (PADDs) in the United States.21", "1.1.2. Oil spills: a sticky problem", "Considering the immense volume of fluids associated with the drilling, production, storage and transportation of oil and refined products, and considering the complexity and number of agents involved in these operations, oil spills can happen due to a variety of reasons. Often causes are associated with leakage, bre ak, explosion, collision, failure or malfunction of equipment, machinery or parts, as well as other factors resulting of human action, such as mishandling, misuse, mistake and deliberate acts by vandals, illegal dumpers, terrorists or countries at war. Oil spills can also be caused or aggravated by natural events like hurricanes or storms.22,23 Irrespective of the cause, oil spills are disastrous events that cause severe, long -lasting environmental, economic, and social effects.", "There is growing scientific evidence of the wide spectrum of the adverse consequences of oil spills to animal and human lives. Oil spilled on land may penetrate the soil and reach th e aquifer before correspond ing immigration measures are taken, and contaminate the groundwater, diffus ing in different streams . Once groundwater is polluted, the process of recovery and purification is expensive and time consuming.24,25 Oil spilled in water has bee n extensively studied, and covered by the media. It is widely known that PHCs (petroleum hydrocarbons), VOCs (volatile organic compounds), and/or PAHs (poly - aromatic hydrocarbons) result in chronic toxicity to a variety of fishes, birds, mammals, reptiles, planktons, benthic invertebrates, coral reefs, marine plants, and habitats.26–34 As a reference, tests of the effects of various crude oils on Daphnia magna , the water flea, show that 5 to 40 mg/L of oil for a period of 24 hours is lethally toxic.22 In contrast, the oil plume in the Deepwater Horizon spill in the Gulf of Mexico was reported to be more than 35 km in length, at approximately 1100 meters depth that persisted for months without substan tial biodegradation.35 In other words, spills input an oil c oncentration in the ocean which is several orders of magnitude higher than the typical lethal dose to many organisms. In order to illustrate the catastrophic dimensions of the environmental effects of oil spills, Figure 1.6 shows a comparison of the Deepwa ter Horizon and the Exxon Valdez spills, the two largest oil spills in the United States. The Exxon Valdez spill in Alaska released 260,000 barrels of oil in the ocean, killing over 250,000 seabirds and billions of salmon and herring eggs according to esti mates. The Deepwater Horizon spill released 4.9 million barrels of oil, and 200,000 metric tons of gases in the ocean, making the environmental effects to skyrocket.36,37 Furthermore, PHCs, VOCs, and PAHs can cause serious physical and mental health impacts such as asthma, inflammation, irritation, dizziness, headac he, cardiovascular disorders, kidney and liver damage, nervous and immune effects, reproductive and developmental deformities in humans.38,39 Studies showed that people involved in the oil spill cleanup operations experience persistent alterations or worsening of their hematological, hepatic, pulmonary, and cardiac functions. In addition, these subjects experienced prolonge d or worsening illness symptoms even 7 years after their exposure to the oil spill.40,41", "Figure 1. 6. Fact sheet about the two largest U.S. oil spills to date.36", "Besides the immediate environmental effects of oil spills, a disruptive economic effect has been reported for different sectors, such as tourism, fishing, mariculture, and salt production .42,43 Also, legal authorities in different regions charge companies billions of dollars for environmental remediation, as well as paying compensation to individuals and communities damaged by oil spills . In fact, the cost has been a major incentive to reduce the chances of such events taking place in the future. Both government and industry are working to reduce the risk of oil spills, with the introduction of strict new legislation and stringent operating codes. Industry has invoked many operating and maintenance procedures to reduce accidents that could lead to spills. In 2011, right after the Deepwater Horizon spill, a comprehensive proces s of continuous regulatory standardization and enhancement resulted in the creation of the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE) in the United States, under the Obama administration.44 The BSEE enforcement activity significantly decreased the number and severity of annual incidents in the U.S. waters.45 Because of improved technical standards, preventive engineering and monitoring, this trend was also obs erved worldwide by different organizations.22 As an example, the global number of large oil spills (>7 ton) from tank ers has decreased drastically during the past decades to an average of 6.2 events per year (Figure 1.7), representing approximately a 92 % reduction in comparison with the average in the 1970s. It is clear that both categories of oil spills (7 -700 and >700 ton) are well distributed around the globe, demonstrating the international relevance of the problem.46 Even representing an estimated 80 % (by number) of all recorded spills, smaller spills (<7 ton) remain a challenge, as they may go undetected or unreported.28", "Figure 1. 7. Global occurrenc e of oil spills from tankers by year, size, and localization.46", "Despite the significant reduction, large oil spills are still happening. In late August 2019, a “mysterious” oil began to wash the beaches of Paraiba state, in Northeast Brazil . Four months after the first report, the oil has been found along over 3000 km of the Brazilian coastline on almost 1000 beaches . Remote -sensing techniques and even low -altitude airplane flights failed to detect the oil before it reached the shores .47,48 To this date, the official Brazilian task force website reports that the exact origin and volume spilled remain under investigation, and very limited evidence was shared on its progress.49 Computer simulations based on the distribution of the oil along the coast, marine transport and weather conditions poi nt to an offshore source about 700 kilometers away that started to spill oil about 1 month before it hit land (Figure 1.8a).50", "Figure 1. 8. (a) Computational study tracking the possible source of the spill.50 (b) Volume, geographical distribution of the collected oil, and presence of seagrass species.51", "The disorganization and inadequate response from the government led to a widespread appeal to voluntarism, mobilizing thousands of people who were unprotected for removing oil waste, often by hand and without the necessary instructions or equipment, which might result in serious public health concerns.52 A total of 4,700 tons of oil has been collected on the coast of different states (Figure 1.8b). Many species of seagrass, which shelter threa tened species like the green sea turtle ( Chelonia mydas Linnaeus ), were severely affected by the spills. At least other 26 coastal threatened species are reported to be found within the areas affected by the oil spill. 49,51,53 Given the global relevance of oil spills, and the disruptive environmental, economic and social effects, and considering the long processing time and limited efficiency of tra ditional cleanup procedures,54–57 the development of new materials and processes for oil/water separation are highly encouraged.", "1.2. Polymeric materials as oil sorbents", "Oil sorbent m aterials comprise a wide range of organic, inorganic and synthetic products designed to recover oil in preference to water. Their composition and configuration are dependent upon the material used and their intended application in the response. While widel y used in spill response, sorbents should be employed with caution to minimize inappropriate and excessive use that can present major logistical difficulties associated with secondary contamination, retrieval, storage and disposal.58 Besides, while a substant ial number of papers describe oil sorbent materials, very few evaluate their toxicity or possible microbiological side effects.", "Two broad categories of sorption phenomena, adsorption and absorption, can be differentiated by the degree to which the sorbate molecule interacts with the sorbent phase and its freedom to migrate within the sorbent. In adsorption, solute accumulation is in general restrict to the surface or interface between the solution and adsorbent. In contrast, absorption is a process in which solute, transferred from one phase to the other, and interpenetrates the sorbent phase by at least several nanometers. Sorption results from a variety of different types of attractive forces between solute, solvent and sorbent molecules. Chemical, electro static and physical forces act together, but usually one type prevails in a particular situation.59 Polymeric sorbents are particularly interesting, as in general they can offer low water uptake, excellent physical and chemical resistance, low density, and functional versatility. Structurally, they can be classified as aerogels,60 coatings,61 fibers,62 and 3D -printed materials.63 Surface chemistry and morphology determine the wettability of the polymeric surfaces, which closely relates to the adsorption of oils and oil/water separation efficiency.64 In this section, the fundamentals of wettability of surfaces are reviewed, and the r ecent advances on polymeric coatings for oil/water separation are summarized.", "1.2.1. Wettability of surfaces", "Wetting of a solid surface by liquid can be quantitatively described from the profile of a static liquid droplet, more specifically from the tange ntial angle at the liquid -solid -air interface, often measured by a goniometer.65,66 Figure 1.9 shows a water droplet placed on a solid, flat surface in air. The solid -air and water -air interfaces come together with a static contact angle, 𝜃𝑊. The value of 𝜃𝑊 can be determined from the condition of the total energy of the system being minimized, and is given by Young’s equation for the contact angle:", "cos 𝜃𝑊=𝛾𝑆𝐴−𝛾𝑆𝑊 where 𝛾𝑆𝐴, 𝛾𝑆𝑊, and 𝛾𝑊𝐴 are the surface tensions of the solid -air, solid -water, and water -air interfaces, respectively.67", "Figure 1. 9. Demonstration of the Young’s angle.67", "The wettability of the solid surface can be classified into four regimes using contact angles for water: superhydrophobic ( 𝜃𝑊>150° ), hydr ophobic ( 90<𝜃𝑊≤150° ), hydrophilic ( 0<𝜃𝑊≤90°), and superhydrophilic ( 𝜃𝑊 ~ 0°). Similarly, based on contact angles for a low surface tension liquid such as an oil ( 𝜃𝑂), surfaces are considered superoleophobic ( 𝜃𝑂>150° ), oleophobic ( 90<𝜃𝑂≤150° ), oleophilic ( 0<𝜃𝑂≤90°), and superoleophilic ( 𝜃𝑂 ~ 0°). Typically, superhydrophobic or superoleophobic surfaces are referred to as super -repellent surfaces.68,69 Perfectly flat surfaces are an idealized concept, and common surfaces have an associated roughness which affects their wettability. The Wenzel an d Cassie -Baxter are two models that describe the contact angle as a function of the surface roughness.", "The Wenzel model is based on the assumption that the liquid completely penetrates the roughness grooves (Figure 1.10a). For a droplet in contact with a rough surface, the apparent contact angle ( 𝜃∗) is given by the Wenzel equation:", "cos𝜃∗=𝑅𝑓cos𝜃 (2) where 𝜃 is the contact angle of the liquid droplet on a solid surface ( 𝜃𝑊 or 𝜃𝑂), and 𝑅𝑓 is a roughness factor defined as:", "𝑅𝑓=𝐴𝑆𝐿𝐴𝐹⁄ (3) where 𝐴𝑆𝐿 is the solid -liquid area, and 𝐴𝐹 is the flat solid -liquid contact area; that is, a projection of 𝐴𝑆𝐿 on the horizontal plane. Per definition, 𝑅𝑓=1 for flat surfaces, whereas 𝑅𝑓>1 for rough or textured surfaces.67,70 Consequently, 𝑅𝑓 yields a lower apparent contact angle for a liquid with 𝜃<90°. On the other hand, a higher apparent contact angle can be achieved for a liquid with 𝜃>90°.68,71", "Figure 1. 10. Representation of water drops on hydrophobic pillars, according to the (a) Wenzel and (b) Cassie -Baxter models. (c) Intermediate state, where the water drop partially penetrates the grooves.72", "The Cassie -Baxter model exists when air is trapped underneath the liquid droplet, forming a composite solid –liquid –air interface (Figure 1.10b). The apparent contact angles in this state can be calculated using the Cassie –Baxter relation, given as:", "cos𝜃∗=𝑓𝑆𝐿cos𝜃+𝑓𝐿𝐴cos𝜋=𝑓𝑆𝐿cos𝜃−𝑓𝐿𝐴 (4) where 𝑓𝑆𝐿 and 𝑓𝐿𝐴 are areal fractions of the solid -liquid and the liquid -air interfaces, respectively. Since the contact angle of water in air is 180°, the expression can be reduced to the form on the right side on the equation 4. Also, 𝑓𝐿𝐴 is often written as 1−𝑓𝑆𝐿, so this equation can assume the form cos𝜃∗=𝑓𝑆𝐿(1+cos𝜃)−1 in the literature .72,73 Different works have investigated boundaries of these models for specific systems, and developed derivations such as an intermediate state (Figure 1.10c).65,74 –76 For practical applications, however, the wettabi lity of the surface is the fundamental point, irrespective of the model used to describe its characteristics. Figure 1.11 shows different combinations of the selective wettability of membranes for oil and water droplets: superhydrophilic and superoleophili c, superhydrophilic and superoleophobic, superhydrophobic and superoleophobic, and superhydrophobic and superoleophilic.", "Figure 1. 11. Selective wettability of membranes for oil and water droplets.68", "The progress of surface engineering has allowed the accurate control of the selective wettability of substrates towards different liquids, resulting in a number of applications for a wide variety of fields, such as anti -corrosion, anti -icing, anti -fogging, anti -fouling, anti -microbial, cements, oil/water separation, flow assurance, textile, and others.77–79 In fact, scientists learned many lessons from nature, specifical ly understanding the multifunctional surface structures of plants, and its evolutionary changes to adapt to nearly all conceivable habitats on Earth through millions of years.80 Perhaps the most famous superhydrophobic surface is the lotus leaf ( Nelumbo nucifera ), exhibiting a water contact a ngle of approximately 162°. During rolling off, dust and dirt particles adhere to the water droplet, resulting in the so-called self -cleaning effect, which is also a protection against plant pathogens like fungi and bacteria", "Figure 1. 12.

Wax is a general term for the framework largely composed of cutin, an insoluble polyester of primarily long -chain hydroxy fatty acids, and other hydrophobic compounds.65,81 Neinhuis and Barthlott reported the water contact angle and morphological characteristics of 200 water -repellent plant species with rough, waxy leaf st ructures .82 Many studies reported bioinspired surfaces with smart, improved characteristics, such as switchable properties subject to different external stimuli. This area is of potential benefit for biomaterials, biosensors, information storage, microfluidic systems, adhesive materials, nanolithography, and so on .83,84 As an example, a thermo -reversible polymer coating on a lotus leaf pattern was developed.85 Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) was used as a mold, cured over a lotus leaf, and the leaf microstructure was imprinted in a cellulose acetate film (Figure 1.13). Ten bilayers of negatively and positively charged macroiniti ators were incorporated on the molded film , followed by the surface - initiated polymerization of N -isopropylacrylamide at room temperature. SEM images showed that the replicated surface with poly(N -isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) brushes successfully mimicked the original morphological features of the lotus leaf.", "Figure 1. 13.

At 25 °C (below the LCST), the surface was superhydrophilic, with a contact angle of 0°. On the other hand, at 40 °C (above the LCST) , the surface was superhydrophobic, with a contact angle of 153 ± 2°. The thermal reversibility of the wettability was performed 5 consecutive times by heating and cooling the surface, without observing any change on the respective contact angles for each state.", "For a number of chemical and physical processes – in daily life, in nature and in technical applications – the structure and composition of surfaces determine the performance of the system.86 Theref ore, the wettability of surfaces require careful investigation for assessing its properties, stability and efficiency for a given application.", "1.2.2. Polymeric coatings for oil/water separation", "In the past years, polymeric coatings for oil/water separatio n have received a lot of attention in the scientific community. As a general strategy, different porous substrates are coated with a polymer or polymeric composite with tailored wettability. Specifically, ideal coating candidates for oil/water separation c an display either ( 𝑖) superhydrophilic and superoleophobic, or ( 𝑖𝑖) superhydrophobic and superoleophilic character, as illustrated in Figure 1.11. On the first case, the coated substrate would selectively absorb water, and repel oil, whereas on the latt er case the coated substrate would selectively absorb oil, and repel water. The best coating depends on the fabrication procedure, substrate, adhesion, cost, scalability, and operational factors.", "Matin, Baig and Gondal prepared a superhydrophobic/superoleo philic coating based on perfluorooctyltrichlorosilane (PFOTCS) on a stainless steel mesh screen.87 First, the mesh screen was treated with a concentrated H 2SO 4 solution, and saturated Na 2Cr2O7 solution for 30 min at 65 °C. After several washes with water and acetone, the mesh screen was dip coated in a PFOTCS solution for 1 h, allowing for its hydrolys is and polycondensation at room temperature, and bonding to the surface of the substrate, forming a siloxane network (Figure 1.14a,b). The coating procedure was repeated for seven times. The coated mesh screen exhibited superhydrophobic/superoleophilic cha racter, and therefore it was tested for oil/water separation by placing it between two glass tubes, and clamping them together. For comparison, the authors tested the oil/water separation with a coated and uncoated screen. As expected, the uncoated screen did not separate the water/hexadecane (50/50 v/v) mixture, since both liquids passed thought it (Figure 1.14c). However, the coated mesh screen separated water from oil (Figure 1.14d), since water stayed on the upper part of the experimental setup, and the hexadecane was collected in the bottom.

The reagents were added in ethanol, and stirred for 30 min to have a paint -like suspensio n, which was spray coated on the mesh screen, and cured for 24 hours (Figure 1.15a). The epoxy -based coating exhibited water contact angle of 154.8°, and oil contact angle of 0°. So the superhydrophobic/superoleophilic coating was tested for oil/water sepa ration (Figure 1.15b), and the separation efficiency ranged from 93 -97.5% for hexane, toluene, chloroform, diesel and kerosene mixtures with water (Figure 1.15c).", "Figure 1. 15.

The reaction was carried out at 100 °C for about 5 hours, and the resulting copolymer was neutralized with ammo nium hydroxide. Second, the coating was prepared by mixing the prepared copolymer with certain amounts of ammonia, ethanol, and water, heating this mixture to 60 °C, and slowly adding methyltrimethoxysilane, allowing it to stir overnight. The mesh screen w as spray coated with the silicone -acrylic formulation, and cured at 80 °C for 12 hours. The coating exhibited a water and oil contact angle of 157.7° and 0°, respectively, therefore demonstrating its superhydrophobic and superoleophilic character. Besides, it showed nanometric texturing, as indicated by SEM and Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) images.

Different concentrations of the additives were evaluated, in a total of 11 formulations, and the highest oil contact angle obtained was associated with the highest concentration of SiO 2 nanoparticles (12 g/l), what resulted in micro/nanometrical roughness, as indicated by SEM and AFM images.

The oil/water separation was demonstrated for the coated mesh screen and coated sponge, whereas the coated g lass was used for wearing tests with an accelerated tribometer. For the coated mesh screen (Figure 1.18a), the water passed through it, being collected in the bottom, while the vegetable oil stayed in the upper part. On the other hand, the coated sponge wa s immerged in the liquid mixture using a tweezer (Figure 1.18b), and the denser water phase in the bottom of the beaker was selective absorbed by the coated material. These experiments successfully demonstrate the superoleophobic/superhydrophilic character of the coating, which has superimposed layers of adhesive and fluorinated particles (Figure 1.18c).", "Figure 1. 18.

The ink was stirred (650 rpm for 1 hour), degassed, and centrifuged (8000 rpm for 20 min). The ink was 3D -printed as a porous membrane, and coated with a fluorosilane (Figure 1 .19a). Through tailoring the ink rheology/SiO 2 loading and adjusting the porous structure, the 3D -printing approach integrates the superhydrophobic surface into the porous framework and avoids the weak interface adhesion issue that arises with traditional superhydrophobic membranes based on coating a mesh structure. Figure 1.19b shows several water droplets over the printed membrane, and the contact angle image, exhibiting its clear superhydrophobic character (158°). Figure 1.19c shows an AFM image of the 3 D surface of the printed membrane, exhibiting multiscale roughness.

The coatings consisted of polymer brushes obtained by Activators ReGenerated by Electron Transfer Atom Transfer Radica l Polymerization (ARGET -ATRP). Sodium methacrylate was polymerized to create a hydrophilic, water -selective poly(sodium methacrylate) (PNaMA) functionalized mesh, and stearyl methacrylate (StMA) was polymerized to create a hydrophobic, oil -selective mesh.

Also , most of these coatings were tested with just one or a few types of oils, what limits their application for oil spill cleanup. Besides, the vast majority of studies do not evaluate saline water, which further constrain their final application to freshwate r, while a vast volume has been historically spilled in seawater. Finally, very limited information about the thermal degradation and stability of these coatings is available in the literature, and a better understanding of their thermal behavior could exp and their applications in other fields.", "1.3. Water -based drilling fluids: an opportunity for biomass valorization", "In general, the main functions performed by a drilling fluid are: (i) carry the cuttings generated by the drill bit to the surface to allow t heir separation; (ii) maintain the chemical and mechanical stability of the borehole; (iii) form a thin layer with low permeability to seal the rock pores and minimize the volume of filtrate reaching the formation; (iv) minimize damage to the rock formatio n; (v) cool and lubricate the bit. Besides, drilling fluids should not be harmful to the environment or the workers involved in the operation. Water -based drilling fluids (WBFs) are used whenever possible, since they are cheaper and more environmentally fr iendly than the synthetic ones.99–102 Figure 1.20a shows a representation of an on -shore drilling operation, where the WBF is pumped from the tanks, down to the drillpipe, and it returns up to the surface through the annulus, enclosing the circulation system. The pressure of the mud column must be greater than the formation pore pressure to prevent the inflow of formation fluids, what can be highly dangerous to the operation. However, considering the porosity and permeability of the rocks, the fluid would continuously invade the permeable formations.102 In order to control the invasion of liquid to the formation, filt rate reducers (FRs) are largely used in the formulation of drilling fluids.103–105 FRs allow the drilling fluid to seal permeable formations exposed by the bit with a thin, low - permeability filter cake (or ‘mud cake’), maintaining the stability of the wellbore (Figure 1.20b). Filtration properties must be controlled in order to prevent thick filter cakes from excessively reducing the diameter of the borehole. Furthermore, thick filter cakes may cause the drill pipe to become stuck by a mechanism known as differential sticking, where the differential pressure created by the er osion of the filter cake may be great enough to prevent the pipe from being moved.106 Good filtration properties are also necessary when drilling in unconsolidated sands, which will slump into the boreho le, collapsing the well unless protected by the rapid formation of a filter cake.102,107 Borehole stability is one of the main problems in the oil and gas industry, with lost -time and trouble costs conservatively estimated at US$ 500 million/year.108", "Figure 1. 20. (a) On -shore drilling operation.109 (b) Representation of the filter cake formation on the walls of the annulus. The vertical arrow show the direction of flow, while horizontal arrows show the wellbore pressure that promotes the filter cake build -up.110", "Many natural and synthetic FRs are used in drilling fluids, such as bentonite,111,112 cellulose,113,114 carboxymethylcellulose,115,111 starch,103,116 aphrons,99 microspheres,101 graphene oxide,117 nanocomposites,118,119 and nanoparticles.120,121 The formulation of a drilling fluid de pends on the characteristics of the well (such as geometry, geological composition, and temperature/pressure gradients), as well as economic, logistical and environmental factors.100 In order to lower the cost of the drilling fluid, as well as to shift towards a more sustainable, circular economy, the incorporation of agro waste in WBFs have been stimulated. From the cost standpoint, agro waste is cheaper than other biopolymers, and is substantially cheaper than synthetic alternatives. Agwu and Akpabio reviewed several works using agro waste materials for WBFs, achieving comparable or superior results if compared with synthetic FRs (Table 1.2) .122", "Table 1. 2. Summary of experimental results from different agro -waste materials in WBFs.122 Agro waste Temperature (°C) Particle size ( µm) VAPI (mL) Agarwood waste - 45-90 13-16 Cassava starch 12-71 15-16 Groundnut husk - - 7.6-6.5 Gum arabic 65 - 17 Potato starch - - 7-13.5 Sugarcane bagasse ash 25-80 - 18-22.5 Waxy hulless barley - - 3.9", "Therefore, considering the immense variety of lignocellulosic, agro waste materials abundantly available in different regions in the globe, it is important to evaluate their properties as FRs for WBFs.", "1.4. Scope of the thesis", "The remaining chapters of the thesis are focused on evaluating different polymeric materials for environmental applications in the oil and gas industry.", "In the chapter 2, a superhydrophobic/superoleophilic coating based on an alkyl methacryla te was developed, characterized, and tested in two substrates (a flat panel and a mesh screen). The coated mesh screen exhibited excellent oil/water separation efficiency with seven oils of wide commercial interest, good adhesion properties, and recyclabi lity. Besides, the thermal degradation and stability of the coating are described, as well as an evaluation of the surface wettability changes with temperature and time, in correlation with structural changes.", "In the chapter 3, exploring the easiness and v ersatility of the methacrylate chemistry, and expanding the previous chapter, a superhydrophobic/superoleophilic coating based on cyclic methacrylate was designed. On the characterization of the coated screens, more emphasis was done on quantitatively desc ribing the nano/micro -scale roughness of the surfaces, in correlation with their wetting properties. Furthermore, the coated mesh screen exhibited outstanding oil/water separation efficiency with eight oils of wide commercial interest, besides mixtures of hexane and three different saturated brines, what suggests its use to a maritime environment. On top of excellent adhesion properties assessed by static and dynamic tests, the coating showed high recyclability, and high thermal stability, what can be inter esting to other applications beyond oil/water separation.", "In the chapter 4, the utilization of an agro waste, Miscanthus x. Giganteous , was first described as filtrate reducers for water -based drilling fluids. The fines were grinded, sieved, characterized, and the effect of the particle size on the filtration properties of the fluids was evaluated. The smallest particles in the study resulted in comparable or superior filtration properties than other synthetic additives that are obtained by more complex, mu ltistep procedures, using chemical solvents. This work to promotes the valorization of this agro waste for oilfield applications.", "In the chapter 5, general conclusions and closing remarks are discussed.", "In the chapter 6, future work suggestions are summari zed.", "1.5.

Macromolecular Materials and Chapter 2. Fluorine -free super hydrophobic coatings: rapid fabrication and highly efficient oil/water separation", "ABSTRACT In this work, we demonstrate a rapid method to obtain a fluorine -free superhydrophobic/superoleophilic coating by a simple two -step method: dip -coating and oven curing. The chemical structure of the coating is based on the crosslinking reaction of an alkyl methacrylate, a dimethacrylate (crosslinker) and a silane (adhesive), using AIBN as initiator, toluene as solvent, and silica nanoparticles to enhance surface roughness. Chemorheology results show that the coating is fully cured even in 20 min at 100 °C, exhibiting a water contact angl e (CA) of 162 ± 2°, sliding angle (SA) of 4 ± 1°, nanometrical structures throughout the surface, and excellent adhesion properties for the mesh screen. The coating exhibited outstanding oil/water separation efficiency (96 -99%) for seven different types of oil (gasoline, diesel, petroleum ether, hexane, toluene, chloroform and dichloromethane), and in addition presented high recyclability. Based on non -isothermal TGA, the activation energy of degradation, calculated using the Kissinger and Ozawa models, was 113.5 and 114 kJ/mol, respectively. Finally, the coating was thermally aged at 150 ° C: the CA exhibited a smooth decrease up to 129 ± 1° at 120 min, and FTIR analysis showed structural changes possibly related to the generation of thermal oxidation produc ts.", "Keywords: superhydrophobic, superoleophilic, oil/water separation, thermosetting methacrylate, thermal degradation", "1. Introduction", "Despite the significant growth on the use of renewable energies over the past decade, oil has been the leading source of energy in the globe for many decades, and it is estimated to remain on top by million barrels per day.2 The extensive amount of petrochemicals used in our daily life goes much beyond transportation, as they are also used in many chemical industries for a number of applications, fr om plastics to asphalt.3–5 During drilling and producti on operations, as well as during the transportation of petroleum and its derivatives, different factors can lead to the occurrence of catastrophic spills, such as mishandling, leakage, explosion and other accidents. Regardless of the cause, oil spills can have enormous environmental, economic and social effects. In 2010, the deepwater horizon blowout in the Gulf of Mexico resulted in 11 deaths, released hundreds of tons of oil in the ocean, and costed billions of dollars in fines and remediation.6–8 Traditionally, oil/water separation methods include gravity separation, air flotation, filtration, centrifugation, and the use of chemical absorbent materia ls. However, these methods are generally slow, expensive, and can have a low separation efficiency. Skimming and burning are even less attractive methods, since they have a poorer performance and further harm the environment, respectively.9,10 Therefore, the development of highly efficient, fast, cost-effective and environmentally friendly technologies to separate oil/water mixtures remains a challenge.", "Superhydrophobic coatings have gained a lot of attentio n in the past years, and they have been used as anticorrosion, self -cleaning, antifog, and anti -ice surfaces. Moreover, inspired by the non - wetting property of the lotus leaf, superhydrophobic coatings have been deposited on mesh screens as a strategy for oil/water separation.9–14 By definition, a surface is considered superhydrophobic when the water conta ct angle (CA) is greater than 150 °, and the sliding angle (SA) is less than 10°. On the other hand, for a superoleophilic surface, the contact angle between an oil droplet and the surface is less than 10°. Taking advantage of a porous substrate like a mesh screen, the superhydrophobic/superoleophilic coated surfaces not only repel the water molecules, but selectively absorbs the oil, allowing its separation from the mixture by letting it flow through the pores.14–16 Many superhydrophobic coatings have been developed based on fluoroalkyl molecules.16–19 However, per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) can accumulate in the human and animal bodies by ingestion (when eating food or drinking liquids contaminated with PFAS), generating very severe health effects, such as thyroid hormone disruption and cancer. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) made an action plan to protect public health from the PFAS effects. As a result, p erfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) are no longer produced in the United States.20,21 Besides the serious health consequences of bioaccumulation, these substances are also considered persistent in the environment, as they can pollute ground water and aquatic wildlife.11 Efforts have been made to obtain fluorine -free superhydrophobic coatings for oil/water separation. Zhang and coworkers developed a superhydrophobic/superoleophilic coating based on epoxy resin and SiO 2 nanoparticles, and evaluated the oil/water separation with five dif ferent types of oil (chloroform, diesel, hexane, kerosene, and toluene), where the efficiency of separation ranged from ~93 to 97.5 %. The mechanical integrity of the coating was assessed through simple sandpaper abrasion and scratch tests.13 In a similar approach, Cao and coworkers described a polyurethane -based superhydrophobic/superoleophilic coating, and the separation efficiency of mixtures of water and five oils (hexane, kerosene, petroleum ether, tetrachloromethane and toluene) was higher than 94%. The authors performed a peeling test with a sellotape to evaluate the mechanical durability of the coating.9 Particularly, the Advincula group has reported multifunctional fluori ne-free superhydrophobic coatings based on different chemistries, including rubber -modified polybenzoxazine,12 poly(N - isopropylacrylamide),22 polystyrene/multi -walled carbon nanotubes,23 and electrodeposited polythiopenes.4,24 –27 Herein, we pres ent how to rapidly obtain a fluorine -free superhydrophobic/superoleophilic coating based on common methacrylate chemistry, in a simple and efficient two -step procedure. The oil/water separation efficiency was evaluated for seven oils of commercial interest (gasoline, diesel, petroleum ether, hexane, toluene, chloroform and dichloromethane). Also, isothermal and non - isothermal thermogravimetry (TGA) were performed, and the degradation profiles were described by thermokinetic models. Finally, the coatings wer e submitted to thermal ageing, and the wettability and structural changes were discussed with CA and FTIR data, respectively. While other papers often focus on the mechanical integrity of the superhydrophobic coatings upon physical stresses,9,13,14,19,28,29 there are few reports on their thermal behavior, stability, and degradation .", "2. Experimental", "2.1. Materials", "The following reagents were purchased from Sigma Aldrich: acetone, 2,2′-azobis(2 - methylpropionitrile) ( AIBN), chloroform, dichloromethane (DCM), ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (EGDMA), hexane, hexyl methacrylate (HM), methylene blue, oil red, petroleum ether, toluene, and 3 - (trimethoxysilyl)propyl methacrylate (TMS ).

Two coatings were prepared: a methacrylate coating (hereafter named MC), and a methacrylate coating containing SiO 2 nanoparticles (hereafter named MC -1). MC was prepared by mixing HM, EGDMA, TMS and AIBN (1:0.05:0.05:0.01 w/w, respectively), and using toluene as solvent (1.5:1 w/w solvent/MC reagents). MC -1 was prepared by mixing HM, EDGMA, TMS and AIBN in the same proportions, adding 1% w/w of SiO 2 nanoparticles (SiO 2/MC reagents), and using tol uene as solvent (1.5:1 w/w solvent/MC reagents + SiO 2). Finally, the mesh screen was then immersed in the coating, removed after 10 minutes, and reacted/cured in an oven at 100 °C for 20 min, as illustrated in Figure 2.1. For comparison purposes, a flat st eel panel was precleaned and coated according to the same protocol of the mesh screen. For TGA analysis, the resin was prepared following the same procedure, except for not using the screen. The mixture was casted to obtain a thin film.", "Figure 2. 1.

Without stirring, equal amounts of water (7 ml) and oil (7 ml) were added in a cylinder, and the content was poured onto the coated mesh screen, where the separation occurred solely based on gravity, without using any external pressure. The efficiency of separation ( 𝐸) was determined gravimetrically according to equation", "where 𝑚0 and 𝑚1 are the mass of oil weighted before and after the separation, respectively.11,13,15 The oil was collected in a glass vial placed underneath, and no water was observed in the collected oil. The experiments were carried out at 25 ± 2 ° C, in triplicate, and the results represent the average ± standard deviation.", "For recyclability evaluation of the MC-1 coating, tests were performed using water and petroleum ether mixture for twenty times, in the same conditions. Between cycles, the apparatus was cleaned with compressed air.", "2.4. Characterization methods", "Rheological measurements were obtained on a TA Instruments ARES G2 rheometer using a 25 mm parallel plate geometry, at a frequency of 1 Hz, with a gap size of 1 mm, at 100 °C. For this analysis, the coating was casted on the plate and the reaction/cure was monitored over time. The static water conta ct angle of the coated substrates (mesh screen and flat steel panel) was measured by using a CAM 200 Optical Contact Angle Meter (KSV Instruments) at 25 ± 2 ° C, considering 4 -5 measurements throughout the surface , and the results represent the average ± standard deviation . The adhesion of MC - 1 on the substrates was evaluated based on the ASTM standard test method D -3359,30 where the coated substrate is scratched with a knife in a grid pattern, a tape is applied over the cross -cut area for 90 seconds, and the adhesion qu ality is classified visually after the tape is removed. SEM analysis was done with a Nova NanoLab 200 FIB/SEM at 15 kV. FTIR spectroscopy of the coated mesh screens was performed with a Cary 600 Series FTIR spectrometer in ATR mode (Agilent Technologies), with a nominal spectral resolution of 4 cm−1, and average of 32 scans per run.

All TGA experiments were carried out under N 2.", "3. Results", "3.1. Chemorheology of the curing reaction", "Chemorheology is the study of the flow properties of the reactive polymer system, and it has been widely used to investigate the cure behavior of different polymeric materials.31–34 From the practical standpoint, coatings have to flow during their application. In other words, the viscosity of the coating formulation has to be low enough in order to provide a homogenous distribution of the coating on a substrate, what can dramatically impact the final properties of the coated surfaces.35 For thermosetting coatings, the viscosity plays an important role during the crosslinking reaction, and the understanding of how the viscosity evolves over time is of utmost relevance for the design and optimization of a cure process.36 Figure 2.2 shows th e evolution of the complex viscosity ( |𝜂∗|) over time for MC -1, at 100 °C. Three different stages of reaction kinetics can be easily identified on the curve: (i) an induction period, (ii) polymerization, and (iii) termination, where the viscosity reaches a plateau. During the induction period (i), there was no significant change in viscosity due to the competing effects of heat transfer, which tend to decrease the viscosity due to the temperature equilibration (from room temperature to 100 °C), and the polym erization reaction, which tends to increase the viscosity as the reaction progresses. During the polymerization (ii), there was a pronounced increase in viscosity as higher macromolecular structures are formed. At a later stage of the polymerization (~350 s), the viscosity increase starts to be suppressed due to a decrease of reacting species in the high viscous media, until the reaction is considered terminated by reaching a plateau (iii).32 Chemorheology results indicated that the coating is completely cured at 20 minutes at 100 °C, what represents a substantial reduction in the production time when compared to other superhydrophobic coatings.11,14,16 These condi tions of time and temperature were used to produce the coating on the mesh screen.", "Figure 2. 2. Evolution of the complex viscosity as a function of time for MC -1, at 100 °C.", "3.2. Characterization of the superhydrophobic coating", "In order to assess the wetting behavior of the coatings, the water contact angle (CA) was measured on the coated mesh screen (Figure 2.3a), as well as the sliding angle (SA). The MC coating exhibited a hydrophobic surface with a CA of 121 ± 2° (Fi gure 2.3b), which is associated with the hydrophobic nature of the alkyl tail of the HM, and the network structure formed with the silane (TMS) and crosslinker molecules (EDGMA). Upon incorporation of SiO 2 nanoparticles, the coating MC -1 showed a CA of 162 ± 2° (Figure 2.3c) and a SA of 4 ± 1°, besides exhibiting a rougher surface with nanometrical structures thoroughly covering the substrate (Figure 2.3e), if compared with the MC coated surface (Figure 2.3d). For comparison purposes, a flat substrate was c oated with MC -1 under the same conditions, and it exhibited a CA of 157 ± 2° and a SA of 5 ± 1°. According to the Cassie -Baxter model, rough surfaces can trap air in their cavities, resulting in a higher water CA if compared to smooth surfaces.37 Therefore , the roughness enhancement afforded by the incorporation of SiO 2 nanoparticles effectively led to a superhydrophobic behavior in MC -1 for both substrates (mesh screen and flat panel). The CA of the coated flat panel was lower than the CA of the coated mesh screen, probably due to the structural wav iness of the later, which favors the water repellency. However, both CA values were higher than 150 ° and both SA values were lower than 10°, demonstrating that the coating MC -1 exhibited a superhydrophobic character for both substrates.", "Figure 2. 3. (a) Water CA values for the MC and MC -1 coated mesh screen, and CA images for (b) MC and (c) MC -1. SEM images for the (d) MC and (e) MC -1 coatings. (f) FTIR spectrum of the MC -1 coating.", "Indeed, superhydrophobicity is often achieved by the conjunct effort of the chemical structure of the coating (with hydrophobic nature) and its morphological tuning in order to meet the Cassie -Baxter state. Caldona and coworkers designed a coating based on a rubber -modified polybenzoxazine, achieving a CA of 101 ± 1°, and they incorporated hydrophobic fumed silica nanoparticles up to 50 wt%, increasingly enhancing the CA up to 158 ± 1°.12 Sheng and coworkers obtained amino -silicone oil/polyacrylonitrile membranes with a CA of 145 °, and decorated them with up to 0.4 wt% of hydrophobic silica nanoparticles, raising the CA to 151°.29 Similarly, Li et al fabricated a coating based on candle soot, followed by the deposition of hydrophobic silica nanoparticles in order to reach superhydr ophobicity, with a CA of 160 ± 1°.15 To corroborate with the CA values and morphological observations, FTIR was used to confirm the effective formation of the superhydrophobic coating. Figure 2.3f shows the FTIR spectrum for the MC - 1 coating, exhibiting an intense peak at 1147 cm-1 associated with the C -O-C stretching, and another one at 1727 cm-1 corresponding to the ester C=O stretching. The peaks at 2852 and 2920 cm-1 were associated with the CH 3 symmetric and asymmetric stretchings, respectively, whereas the peak at 1465 cm-1 is related to the C -H bending of the methylene groups. The absence of peaks at 1650 and 3090 cm-1 respectively associated with C=C and =C -H stretching bands, demonstrated that the crosslinking reaction was completed.38 The adhesion of the coating MC -1 on steel substrates (mesh screen and flat panel) was evaluated by the “scratch test”, as described by the ASTM standard test method D -335930 (Table 2.1). Regardless of the substrate, the edges of the cuts looked smooth, and none of the squares of the lattice peeled off after removing the tape. Furthermore, the wettability of the coated substrates after the scratch test was evaluated, specif ically within the cross -cut area. Both coated substrates retained their superhydrophobicity, exhibiting CA (and SA) values of 156 ± 2° (6 ± 1°) and 156 ± 1° (6 ± 1°) for the flat panel and mesh screen, respectively. Therefore, the coating MC -1 exhibited an excellent adhesion property on the refereed substrates, and it kept its prominent water repellency even after the scratch test. This result also demonstrates that the nanoparticles were well stabilized in the resin during the curing reaction, since the asperities of the coating surface were not removed by the tape. The stability and integrity of the coating are associated with the strong and extensive interactions between the polymer network and the substrate, enhan ced by the Si -O-R linkages from the silane used in the coating formulation. Other polymeric coatings also reported the use of silanes to improve their adhesion", "Table 2. 1. Evaluation of the MC -1 coating adhesion on different steel substrates according to the ASTM standard test method D -3359.30 Substrate Visual inspection after the test ASTM D -3359 Area removed (%) Classification Mesh screen Flat panel", "The efficiency of oil/water separation and the thermal stability study were carried out only using the coating MC -1, since it exhibited the superhydrophobic character.", "Figure 2 .4. Photographs of the experimental setup to demonstrate the superhydrophobic and superoleophilic character of MC -1, where (a) water (dyed blue) accumulated on the top of the coated screen, and (b) petroleum ether (dyed red) imm ediately passed through it, being collected in the bottom. The black arrows indicate the progress of time.", "Therefore, the superhydrophobic/superoleophilic coating MC -1 can be used for oi l/water separation, since it can selectively prevent the water passage, but let the oil flow through the pores of the coated screen (as illustrated in Figure 2.5a).12–14 A variety of water and oil mixtures were prepared, and the gravity -driven oil/water separation experiment was carried out using the MC -1 coated screen. As an example, Figure 2. 5b shows the experimental setup for the separation of water (dyed blue) and petroleum ether (dyed red). When the liquids were poured onto the coated mesh screen, only the oil selectively passed through it, being colle cted in the vial, while the water stayed in the upper part. The separation efficiency of the MC -1 coating for different oil/water mixtures is shown in Figure 2.5c. MC -1 exhibited an outstanding separation efficiency for seven different types of oil widely used in different applications, exhibiting values as high as 99% for diesel, petroleum ether and hexane. Table 2.2 shows a comparison of the separation efficiency of different oil/water mixtures by superhydrophobic coatings in the literature, using similar procedures. For simplification, we proposed a classification of the separation efficiency ( 𝐸) as follows: “A” for 𝐸≥ 95% , “B” for 90% ≤𝐸<95% , and “C” for 𝐸<90% . The superhydrophobic/superoleophilic coating MC-1 stood out for exhibiting a quality “A” efficiency of separation for different types of oils, making it a very strong candidate for efficiently cleaning up oil spills from different sources and activities, as well as being suitable for improving industrial separation processes. As an example, Ca o and coworkers obtained a superhydrophobic coating based on p olyurethane/SiO 2, exhibiting quality “A” efficiency of separation for water/toluene and water/kerosene mixtures. However, it exhibited quality “B” for petroleum ether, hexane and tetrachlorometh ane mixtures with water.9 Note that many of the reported works in Table 2.2 took advan tage of incorporating SiO 2 nanoparticles for enhancing the surface roughness, and therefore achieving the Cassie -Baxter state, as discussed before.9,10,12,13,15,16", "Figure 2. 5.

(d) Recyclability of the MC -1 coating for the water and petroleum ether mixture.", "Finally, the assessment of the recyclability of the MC-1 coating for water/petroleum ether is shown in Figure 2.5d. The superhydrophobic/superoleophilic coating maintain ed the separation efficiency approximately constant, exhibiting a quality “A” efficiency even after 20 cycles, demonstrating its durability. Kang and coworkers obtained a superhydrophobic coating based on nanostructured titania, and they reported a quality “A” efficiency over 10 cycles for hexane and water mixtures.28 Table 2. 2.

Thermal analysis", "Despite the vast number of papers describing the applications of superhydrophobic coatings, very few discuss their thermal degradation and thermal properties.40,41 Herein we present a discussion on the isothermal and non -isothermal degradation, and an evaluation of the surface wettability changes with temperature and time, in correlation with structural changes.", "3.4.1. Isothermal and non -isothermal d egradation", "Isothermal TGA is a convenient tool to evaluate the thermal stability of thermosets.5,42,43 Figure 2.6a shows the Isothermal TGA for the MC -1 superhydrophobic/superoleophilic coating at different temperatures over 120 min. At 100 °C, no thermal degradation was observed. This observation further validated the curing condition found by chemorheology (section 3.1). As the temperature progressively increased to 150 °C, the slope of the weight loss became slightly more noticeable, until reaching 175 °C where the thermal degradation was quicker at earlier times. This observation demonstrate that the coating MC -1 can be used in applications that require high temperature.", "Figure 2. 6.

When the heating rate was increased, the weight loss rate was slightly decreased due to heat transfer limitations, as observed in other polymeric materials.42,44 In thermal analysis, T 5% and T 10% are defined as the temperature at which the weight loss is 5 and 10%, respectively. For MC -1, both T 5% and T 10% progressively increased as the heating rate increased from 5 to 40 °C/min (Table 2.3), illustrating the thermal lag. A polyurethane -based coating developed for concrete structures exhibited a T 5% of 134.3 °C at 20 °C/min, which is significantly lower than the result obtained for the superhydrophobic/superoleophilic coating MC-1 in this study.45 The thermal lag effect was further evidenced by the DTG curves (Figure 2.6c), as the peak temper atures shifted to higher temperatures when the heating rate increased. Furthermore, at 5 °C/min, the DTG exhibited five peaks (at approximately 201, 306, 358, 405 and 475 °C). However, as the heating rate increased, some of the thermal events merged, givin g rise to only two broader peaks.", "Table 2. 3. Thermal properties of MC -1. TGA parameters Thermokinetics Heating rate (kJ/mol) R2", "Bertini, Audisio and Zuev studied a series of poly -n-alkyl acrylates (PAA) and poly -n-alkyl methacrylates (PMA) of different carbon length using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. The general mechanism of PAA thermal degradation included random main -chain scission and side -chain reactions leading to the formation of the monomer, dimer, trimer, diester, alcohol, aldehyde, acetate, olefins, and methacrylate. On the other hand, the mechanism of PMA thermal degrada tion included hemolysis of the chain, and possibly side group ester decomposition favoring the formation of the monomer, but also obtaining olefin and methacrylic acid.46 Considering the complex structure of the superhydrophobic/superoleophilic coating in the present study, it is very challenging to detail the chemical pathways of the thermal degradation processes, since it may encompass several heterogeneous reactions tak ing place in parallel and/or in sequence. However, the assessment of the thermal stability of coatings is of high relevance for the whole industrial chain, from fabrication to end -user application. Besides discussing the isothermal and non -isothermal degra dation, we want to provide physicochemical parameters from thermokinetic models, such as the activation energy of thermal degradation. This discussion not only highlights the importance of the structure -property relationship in polymer science, but also pr ovides complementary quantitative information that is relevant for materials being considered for high temperature applications.", "The Kissinger model (equation 2),47 initially developed for differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), was later demonstrated to be applicable to TGA.42,48 In addition, the Ozawa model (equation 3) has been widely employed for kinetic calculations based on TGA data.49 Both models rely on the fact that the plot of a function of the heating rate versus the reciprocal absolute temperature gives a straight line, and the activation energy can be c alculated from its slope. Hence, these models require a minimum of three different heating rates in order to calculate the activation energy. Some works in literature were based on three heating rates ,50,51 however, we have used four heating rates in this study for accuracy purposes.", "ln(𝛽 𝑇𝑑2)=ln(𝐴𝑅 𝑅𝑇𝑑", "where 𝛽 is the heating rate, 𝐴 is the frequency factor, 𝑅 is the gas constant, 𝑇𝑑 is the on -set temperature of degradation, 𝐸𝑎 is the activation energy of thermal degradation, and 𝐶 is a constant. Figure 2.6d shows the plot of ln(𝛽𝑇𝑑2⁄ ) as well as ln(𝛽) as a function of 1𝑇𝑑⁄ according to the models of Kissinger and Ozawa, respectively. As shown in the figure, straight lines were obtained for both models, exhibiting very high correlation coefficient (Table 2.3). Finally, the 𝐸𝑎 was calculated as 113.5 and 114.0 kJ/mol for the Kissinger and Ozawa models, respectively.", "3.4.2. Thermal ageing of MC -1: CA and structural changes", "Considering that 175 °C caused the most prominent effect on the isothermal TGA (Figure 2.6a), the thermal ageing was performed at the temperature of 150 °C. Figure 2.7a shows the effect of the thermal ageing on the CA of the MC -1 coated screen. At 30 min, the surface lost its s uperhydrophobic character, exhibiting a CA of 143 ± 3°. The CA exhibited a smooth decrease up to 129 ± 1° at 120 min of thermal ageing. This is probably associated with the thermal degradation of the coating, which changed its chemical structure and reduce d the water repellent ability.", "FTIR has been used to demonstrate structural changes of polymeric materials during thermal and photo ageing by identifying ageing -sensitive bands on the spectra collected over time.52 The peak at 1147 cm-1 (C-O-C stretchin g) on Figure 2.7b remained almost unchanged with the ageing conditions, and therefore it was chosen as a reference for normalization purposes.53 Examination of the FTIR spectra of thermal aged MC -1 reveals the emergence of the peak at 1727 cm-1 (carbonyl stretching), possibly related to the generation of thermal oxidation products. On the other hand, it was observed a decrease on the peak at 1240 cm-1 (methyl rocking), which is probably due to the alkyl tail scission of the alkyl methacrylate.54", "Figure 2. 7.

This suggests that MC -1 has a very short induction time, if any. The linear equations found were: 0.988 ). A recent report by Morsch and coworkers discussed the thermal oxidative degradation of an epoxy -amine resin, where peaks at 1738 and 1658 cm-1 emerged over time during thermal ageing at 60 °C, and exhibited a linear trend.55 The CA changes evidenced the impact of the thermal ageing on the wettability of the coating, and FTIR provided time -sensitive information regarding the struc tural changes.", "4. Conclusions", "We have demonstrated a rapid and efficient way to obtain a superhydrophobic/superoleophilic methacrylate -based, fluorine -free coating by a simple two -step procedure: dip -coating and oven curing for 20 min. The coatings with ( MC-1) and without (MC) SiO 2 nanoparticles exhibited a contact angle of 162 ± 2° and 121 ± 2° for the mesh screen, respectively. The superhydrophobic character of MC -1 for a flat substrate was also confirmed by contact angle ( 157 ± 2°) and sliding angle ( 5 ± 1°). The MC -1 coated mesh screen exhibited excellent adhesion properties , and an outstanding performance of oil/water separation when tested with seven different oils of wide industrial interest: petroleum ether, gasoline, diesel, hexane, toluene, chlo roform and dichloromethane (96 -99 %). The superhydrophobic coating maintained its high separation efficiency of water/petroleum ether even being recycled for 20 times. These observations encourage further investigation of more specific applications, such a s breaking water -in-oil emulsions. Isothermal and non -isothermal TGA highlighted the superior thermal stability of the MC -1 coating, which was well described by the Kissinger and Ozawa methods, and the activation energy of thermal degradation was calculate d as 113.5 and 114 kJ/mol, respectively . During thermal ageing at 150 °C, the contact angle of MC -1 coated mesh screen decreased up to 129 ± 1° over time, and FTIR analysis showed structural changes possibly related to the generation of thermal oxidation p roducts.", "5.

The chemical structure of the coating is based on the crosslinking reaction of isobornyl me thacrylate , ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (crosslinker) and a 3-(trimethoxysilyl)propyl methacrylate (adhesive), using AIBN as initiator, toluene as solvent , and silica nanoparticles.

Introduction", "An immense volume of a number of chemicals and raw materials are transported by maritime and naval routes, accounting for a complex logistics network between different regions in the globe. In 2019, over 7 billion barrels of oil and petroleum products such as gasoline, diesel and kerosene were consumed in the United States.1 Despite the strengthening of safety standards and the advance of the transportation technologies, catastrophic oil spills have happened in the past years, with severe environmental, economic and social effects.2–5 For these reasons, oil/water separation remains a global challenge.", "Traditional techniques for oil/water separation include filtration, centrifugation, gravity separation, and the use of chemical absorbent materials.6–8 However, these methods are generally slow, expensive, and some of them can have a low separation efficiency. New ap proaches based on surface engineering have explored the properties of superwetting materials. Superhydrophobic surfaces display a water contact angle (CA) greater than 150 °. Due to their prominent water repellency, superhydrophobic coatings have been used as anticorrosion, self -cleaning, and anti-ice surfaces. Conversely, for a superoleophilic surface, the CA between an oil droplet and the surface is less than 10 °. Thus, taking advantage of a porous substrate like a mesh screen, superhydrophobic/superoleoph ilic coated surfaces have been reported as a promising technique for oil/water separation, since they block the passage of water, but selectively let the oil flow through the pores, allowing its separation .9–16 Considering the restrictions on the production of fluorinated chemicals imposed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA),17 efforts have been made to obtain fluorine -free superhydrophobic coa tings for oil/water separation. Bano and coworkers developed a superhydrophobic coating based on polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) embedded with TiO 2 nanoparticles, and they evaluated the oil/water separation with four different types of oil (diesel, kerosene, toluene, and hexane). While the PDMS/TiO 2 coated screens exhibited an efficient s eparation (> 97 %) for all the oils tested, the separation of oil and saline water mixtures was not evaluated, what limits the application of this coating. In a similar approach, Zulfiqar and coworkers developed a superhydrophobic composite coating based o n silica nanoparticles, and they evaluated the separation of mixtures of water with four different types of oil (gasoline, diesel, kerosene, and hexane).18 The superhydrophob ic coating presented a 90 % separation efficiency for the hexane/water mixture, and 89 % for the other oil/water mixtures. Along with the modest efficiency achieved, the effect of salinity in the water phase on the oil/water separation was also not evaluat ed, nor were the adhesion properties of the coating. The few reports in the literature exploring the separation of oil and brine mixtures are not conclusive about the influence of the salt type and its concentration on the performance of the superhydrophob ic coating, evidencing the need of more investigation in this area.", "Particularly, the Advincula group has reported multifunctional fluorine -free superhydrophobic coatings based on different chemistries, including rubber -modified polybenzoxazine,10 methacrylate,19 poly(N -isopropylacrylamide),20 polystyrene/multi -walled carbon nanotubes,21 and electrodeposited polythiopenes.22–26 Specifically on the methacrylates,19 recent results showed that superhydrophobic coatings based on an alkyl methacrylate can be obtained by a simple and fast procedure, exhibiting high efficiency for oil/water separati on. However, the coating had a relatively low thermal stability, what can limit its application for other fields. Moreover, the separation efficiency for oil and brines mixtures was not investigated, restricting the potential application for oil spill clea nup in a maritime environment.", "In this work, we developed a fluorine -free superhydrophobic/superoleophilic coating, in a simple and efficient two -step procedure , based on a cyclic methacrylate. The adhesion properties were assessed based on ASTM standards, and shear rate/turbulence tests. The surface morphology and topography of the coatings were described based on scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and profilometry results. The oil/water separation efficiency was evaluated for eight oils of wide commercial interest (gasoline, diesel, petroleum ether, kerosene, hexane, toluene, chloroform and dichloromethane). Besides, we also evaluated the separation of hexane with three different saturated brines (NaCl, KCl, and MgSO 4, which are major salts in seawater). F inally, the isothermal and non -isothermal degradation was discussed in detail, and the degradation profiles were described by thermokinetic models, allowing the calculation of the thermal energy of thermal degradation.", "2.

Two coatings were prepared: a methacrylate coating (hereafter named Isob), and a methacrylate coating containing SiO 2 nanopartic les (hereafter named Isob/SiO 2). Isob was prepared by mixing IBMA, EGDMA, TMSMA and AIBN (1:0.035:0.035:0.01 w/w, respectively), and using toluene as solvent (1:1 w/w solvent/Isob reagents). Isob/SiO 2 was prepared by mixing IBMA, EDGMA, TMSMA and AIBN in t he same proportions, adding 1% w/w of SiO 2 nanoparticles (SiO 2/Isob reagents), and using toluene as solvent (1:1 w/w solvent/Isob reagents + SiO 2).

The water contact angle was measured within the grid area after the scratch test. Second, to evaluate the effect of turbulence/shear rate, an overhead stirrer was inserted into a beaker containing hexane, and a coated mesh screen was fully immersed in the liquid, in parallel with the stirrer, as described elsewhere.13 The system was stirred at 50, 100 and 150 rpm for 10 minutes.

Between cycles, the apparatus was cleaned with compressed air.", "3. Results", "3.1. Formation and characterization of the coatings", "This study reports t he formation of two methacrylate -based coatings on a mesh screen substrate, as illustrated in Figure 3.1a. In order to assess the wetting behavior of the coatings, the water contact angle (CA) was measured on both coated screens. The water CA images for Is ob (Figure 3.1b) and Isob/SiO 2 (Figure 3.1c) showed a significant difference on the wettability of these coatings, which can be explained in terms of their chemical structures and morphologies. Figure 3.1d shows the water CA values for the coated screens. The Isob coating exhibited a hydrophobic surface with a CA of 140 ± 1°, being associated with the hydrophobic nature of the sterically demanding group of IBMA, and the network structure formed with the silane (TMS MA) and crossli nker molecules (EDGMA). Upon incorporation of SiO 2 nanoparticles, the coating Isob/SiO 2 achieved superhydrophobicity, exhibiting a water CA of 165 ± 3°. According to the Cassie -Baxter model, rough surfaces can trap air in their cavities, resulting in a higher water CA if compared to smooth surfaces.29 Therefore , the roughness en hancement afforded by the incorporation of SiO 2 nanoparticles effectively led to a superhydrophobic behavior in Isob/SiO 2. The prominent water -repellent character of this coating is featured in Figure 3.1e, where the water droplets make minimal contact wit h the coated surface. The morphology and topography of the coatings, and their contribution for reaching the superhydrophobic state will be discussed in the next section. Considering the global relevance of maritime transportation of chemicals, as well as the high volumes of fluids and the complexity involved in offshore drilling/production operations,30,31 it is of utmost relevance to evaluate the wettability properties of the coated screens towards saline water. F igure 3.1f shows the CA values of different saturated brines for the Isob/SiO 2 coated screen. The coating presented CA values of 161 ± 4°, 158 ± 3°, and 159 ± 5° for the NaCl, KCl, and MgSO 4 saturated brines. In other words, the coating exhibited a superhy drophobic behavior with very similar CA values for water and different saturated brines. This observation demonstrates its chemical robustness and possible applicability in a maritime environment. It is noteworthy to mention that these salts are major comp onents of typical seawater, and the salt concentration in the saturated brines is much higher than the respective salt concentration on the ASTM standard test method for the preparation of synthetic seawater.32 Deniz and coworkers evaluated the failure pressure and impact response of glass -epoxy pipes immersed in synthetic seawater.33 Their study found that the synthetic seawater promoted the failure of the pipes, what can lead to serious technical, environmental, and economical consequences. The eruption pressure, for example, increased up to approximately 50% after immersion in synthe tic seawater.", "From the practical standpoint, coatings have to flow during their application. In other words, the viscosity of the coating formulation has to be low enough in order to provide a homogenous distribution of the coating on a substrate, what can dramatically impact the final properties of the coated surfaces.34 Furthermore, to ensure uniformity, coatings have to be quickly cured/hardened under specific conditions, otherwise it can lead to various defects on the surface of the material. For thermosetting coatings, the viscosity plays an important rol e during the crosslinking reaction, and the understanding of how the vi scosity evolves over time is very important for the design and optimization of a cure process.35 Figure 3.1g shows the evolution of the complex viscosity ( |𝜂∗|) over time for Isob/SiO 2, at 100 °C. Three different stages of reaction kinetics can be easily identified on the curve: (i) an induction period, (ii) polymerization, and (iii) termination, where the viscosity reaches a plateau. During the induction period (𝑡<40 𝑠), there was no signifi cant change in viscosity due to the competing effects of heat transfer. During the polymerization, there was a pronounced increase in viscosity as higher macromolecular structures are formed. At a later stage of the polymerization ( 𝑡 ~ 200 𝑠), the viscos ity increase starts to be suppressed due to a decrease of reacting species in the high viscous media, until the reaction is considered terminated by reaching a plateau.36", "Figure 3. 1.

(h) FTIR spectrum of the Isob/SiO 2 coating.", "Chemorheology results indicated that the coating is completely cured in 1 0 minutes at 100 °C, what represents a substantial reduction in the curing time when compared to ot her superhydrophobic coatings described in literature . Ye and coworkers prepared a superhydrophobic coating based on a silicone -acrylic copolymer and silica sol.9 After 4 -5 hours of a multistep synthesis procedure, the coating was finally cured at 80 °C for 12 hours. Another superhydrophobic coating was cured at 100 °C for as long as 24 hours.13 FTIR was used to confirm the effective formation of the superhydrophobic coating. Figure 3.3f shows the FTIR spectrum for the Isob/SiO 2 coated screen , exhibiting a peak at 1159 cm-1 associated with the C -O-C stretching, and another one at 1724 cm-1 corresponding to the ester C=O stretching. The peaks at 2952 and 2877 cm-1 were associated with the CH 3 asymmetric and symmetric stretchings, respectively, whereas the peak at 1465 cm-1 is related to the C -H bending of the methylene groups. The peak at 1052 cm-1 was attributed to the asymmetric motion of silicon atoms in the Si -O-Si stetching, demonstrating that the SiO 2 nanoparticl es were successfully incorporated in the coating.10 The absence of peaks at 1650 and 3090 cm-1 respectively associated with C=C and =C -H stretching bands, demonstrated that the crosslinking reaction was completed.37 Given the superhydrophobic behavior o f Isob/SiO 2, and the potential applicability for water/oil separation, the oil contact a ngle with hexane was also assessed. When the hexane droplet approached the coated screen, it instantaneously spread out over the surface, and completely passed through it. In other words, the CA for hexane was 0 °. The same occurred when seven other types o f oils (gasoline, diesel, petroleum ether, kerosene, toluene, DCM, and chloroform) were tested individually. These observations demonstrate that the Isob/SiO 2 coating i s also superoleophilic. This behavior can be explained in terms of the inherent oleophilic nature of Isob/SiO 2, and the fact that its improved surface roughness enhances the wettability to oils as predicted by the Wenzel equation.38 Therefore, the superhydrophobic/superoleophilic coating Isob/SiO 2 can be used for oil/water separation, since it can selectively prevent the water passage (superhydrophobic character), but let the oil pass through the pores of the coated screen (superoleophilic character).10,11,13", "3.1.1. Morphology a nd topography of the coatings", "Superhydrophobic surfaces can be systematically designed based on the combination of the chemical structure of the coating (with hydrophobic nature) and its morphological tuning (with micro and/or nanoscale texturing) in order to meet the Cassie -Baxter state.29 Syed, Tang and Meng developed a polyaniline/hydrophobically modified SiO 2 composite coating by layer -by-layer deposition.39 When the SiO 2 content in the coating increased from 1 to 5 wt%, the CA increased from 125 ± 2° to 153 ± 2°, respectively. This trend was also confirmed with profilometry measurements, since the 𝑅𝑎 increased from 5.19 ± 0.21 µm to 13.28 ± 0.53 µm, as well as with morphological changes on the coating surface observed by SEM, where the inhomogeneous asperities increased with increased silica content. Similarly, Caldona and coworkers designed a coating based on a rubber -modified polybenzoxaz ine, achieving a CA of 101 ± 1°, and they incorporated hydrophobic fumed silica nanoparticles up to 50 wt%, increasingly enhancing the CA up to 158 ± 1°. These results were also accompanied with correspondent morphological observations.10 Figure 3.2a shows the SEM images for the uncoated and coated mesh screens. The uncoated screen displays a very flat and homogeneous surface, whereas some asperities are easily observed for the coating Isob. These asperities became smaller, and more homogeneously distributed for the coating Isob/SiO 2. The nanometrical texturing can be associated with the effective dispersion of the silica nanoparticles in the coating. SEM -EDS was used for a qualitative assessment of the surface compositions. Figure 3.2b and 3.2c respectively show the SEM -EDS images and the individual chemical mapping for the uncoated and coated surfaces. Comparing the uncoated surface with the coated ones, the carbon intensity for the coated surfaces is signific antly higher than the uncoated, what demonstrates the effective formation of the coating. Comparing the coated surfaces, the coating Isob/SiO 2 showed a higher silicon intensity than the coating Isob, what is in agreement with their chemical composition (se ction 2.2).", "Figure 3. 2. (a) SEM, (b) SEM -EDS and (c) element mapping images of C, O, Si and Cr for the uncoated and coated mesh screens.", "Profilometry is a convenient technique to quantitatively assess the surface topography and profiles, being widely used to characterize systems and to evaluate a number of chemical, physical, biomedical, and industrial applications. Specifically, this technique is very useful for coating science, since the surface roughness significantly imp acts the surface wetting, adhesion, corrosion protection, tribology, and other properties.39–41 Figure 3.3a shows the 3D surfaces for the Isob and Isob/SiO 2 coatings. Overall, it is noticeable that the surface topography of Isob/SiO 2 is rougher than Isob, what corroborates the SEM results. Besides, the coating Isob/SiO 2 shows higher peaks and de eper valleys throughout its surface, demonstrating a multiscale texturing. These observations are further supported by five surface profile measurements for each coating (Figure 3.3b). For comparison purposes, the central area within ± 0.5 µm of height was highlighted. Most of the surface profiles of the Isob coating stayed within the highlighted area, what demonstrates its relative smoothness. On the other hand, the Isob/SiO 2 coating displayed many peaks and valleys outside of the highlighted area. Further more, these micrometrical features exhibited fine, nanometrical asperities, and the multiscale roughness achieved by Isob/SiO 2 explains its prominent water -repellent behavior as predicted by the Cassie -Baxter state.29 The 𝑅𝑎 values for the Isob and Isob/SiO 2 coatings are 480 ± 39 and 686 ± 102 nm, respectively. In addition, the 𝑅𝑞 values for the Isob and Isob/SiO 2 coatings are 574 ± 47 and 711 ± 56 nm, respectively. Therefore, both roughness parameters for the Isob/SiO 2 coating were higher than the ones for Isob, what corrob orates the water CA results for these coatings, as discussed in the previous session.", "Figure 3. 3.

When the SiO 2 content increased from 1 to 10 wt%, the 𝑅𝑎 increased from 26 to 285 nm, whereas the 𝑅𝑞 increased from 33 to 429 nm, respectively . The 𝑅𝑞 values were higher than the 𝑅𝑎 values for all the samples.42 In another work, optically transparent superhydrophobic silica films were synthesized by the sol -gel method. As the concentratio n of silica nanoparticles increased from 1 to 3 wt%, the 𝑅𝑞 respectively increased from 49 to 80 nm, enhancing the water CA values from 140 to 164 °.43", "3.2. Adhesion properties", "The coating adhesion on a substrate plays an important role on the resulting properties of the surface, and how they behave over t ime. This requires special attention in multi -coat systems, where the adhesion is relevant not only between the substrate and the first layer of coating, but also between all the subsequent coating layers.39 From the practical standpoint, adhesion affects usability. Good adhesion properties ensure that the coated mesh screens can be used many times w ithout being replaced, despite physical stresses and shear that might arise at the environment that the coating is being used. In this work, the adhesion properties of the Isob/SiO 2 coating were evaluated by the “scratch test”, as described by the ASTM sta ndard test method D -3359 ,28 as well as by shear rate/turbulence tests.", "According to the ASTM standard,28 the classifications 5B, 4B, 3B, 2B, 1B, and 0B are associated with 0%, less than 5 %, 5 -15 %, 15 -35 %, 35 -65 %, and more than 65 % of area removed, respectively. Figure 3.4a shows the visual inspection of the Isob/SiO 2 coated screen after the scratch test. The edges of the cuts looked smooth, and none of the squares of the lattice peeled off after removing the tape. Hence, according to the referred ASTM standard, this coating was cl assified as 5B. In order to evaluate the impact of the scratch test on the wettability of the coated screen, the water CA was measured after the scratch test, specifically within the cross -cut area. The Isob/SiO 2 coated screen retained its superhydrophobic ity, exhibiting a water CA of 155 ± 1° even after the scratch test . We recently reported a superhydrophobic coating based on an alkyl methacrylate that exhibited similar results, being classified as 5B as per ASTM standards, and it also kept its superhydrophobicity even after the scratch test.19 In contrast, a multilayer polyaniline/ SiO 2 composite coating with a silica loading of 1 -2 % was classified by the same method as 4B (where less than 5 % of the coating was removed), and when the s ilica loading increased to the range of 3-5 %, then the coatings were classified as 3B (where 5 -15 % of the coating was removed).39", "Figure 3. 4.

The frequency of rotation (Figure 3.4b) and time (Figure 3.4c) did not impact the wettability of the coatin g, since it kept its superhydrophobic behavior, exhibiting water CA values higher than 150 ° for all the testing conditions. Therefore, the coating Isob/SiO 2 exhibited an excellent adhesion property on the mesh screen , and it kept its prominent water repellency even after the scra tch, and turbulence tests. These result s demonstrate that the silica nanoparticles were well stabilized in the resin during the curing reaction, since the asperities of the coating surface were not removed by the tape , or by t he effect of shear . The stability and integrity of the coating are associated with the strong and extensive interactions between the polymer network and the substrate, enhanced by the Si -O-R linkages from the silane used in the coating formulation.19 Many different silanes have been used to enhance the adhesion properties of polymeric coatings , such as: methyltrichlorosilane,12,44 methyltrimethoxysilane ,9 octadecyltrichlorosilane ,45 trimethylchlorosilane,18,43 among others.", "3.3.

After pouring the liquids into the separation device with the coated screen, the oil selectively passed through it, being collected in the vial, while the water stayed in the upper part of th e device. Similarly, mixtures of water with seven other types of oils (gasoline, diesel, petroleum ether , kerosene, toluene, DCM , and chloroform) were tested individually , and t he separation efficiency of the Isob/SiO 2 coating for the different oil/water m ixtures is shown in Figure 3.5c.", "The coating Isob/SiO 2 exhibited an outstanding separation efficiency for all eight different types of oil with diverse industrial relevance, what demonstrate its chemical robustness and versatility. For comparison purposes , Table 3.1 shows an overview of the separation efficiency of different oil/water mixtures by superhydrophobic /superoleophilic coatings in the literature, using similar procedures. We proposed a classification of the separation efficiency ( 𝐸) as follows: “A” for 𝐸≥95% , “B” for 90% ≤𝐸< 95% , and “C” for 𝐸<90% . The superhydrophobic/superoleophilic coating Isob/SiO 2 stood out for exhibiting a quality “A” efficiency of separation for all the types of oil studied. On the other hand, most coatings were tested with a few types of oil, what limits their application. Also, some coatings exhibited a lower separation efficiency (“B” or “C”) depending on the type of oil. As an example, Zhang and coworkers developed an e poxy resin/SiO 2 hybrid coating, exhibiting quali ty “A” efficiency for water/diesel, water/kerosene and water/chloroform mixtures. However, it showed quality “B” for hexane and toluene mixtures with water.11 Note that many of the reported works in Table 3.2 took advantage of incorporating SiO 2 nanoparticles for enhancing the surface roughness, and therefore achieving the Cassie -Baxter state, Considering that chemical tankers transport high volumes of chemicals not only by rivers and lakes, but also by long distance maritime routes, the separation efficiency of hexane/saturated brines was also evalu ated for the Isob/SiO 2 coated mesh screen (Figure 3.5d). The superhydrophobic/superoleophilic coating exhibited quality “A” efficiency of separation for the mixtures of hexane, and saturated NaCl, KCl and MgSO 4 brines. This corroborates with the CA results for these saturated brines, as discussed previously. As seen on table 3.1, other superhydrophobic coatings only evaluated the separation efficiency of oil and NaCl saturated brines, what limits their application. As an example, Zhao and coworkers develope d a superhydrophobic/superoleophilic polyethylene film, and it efficiently separated a hexane/saturated NaCl brine.47 Other works evaluated the effect of a much lower concentration of NaCl on the wettability properties o f superhydrophobic coatings, such as 0.5 M48 and 1.0 M49. The high separation efficiency achieved by the coating Isob/SiO 2 for oil/water and oil/saturated brines demonstrates its possible applicability towards cleaning up oil spills from different types of chemicals commonly transported by chemical tankers, domestically or internationally , including the ones navigating through highly saline waters. Besides , this process might be suitable for improving industrial separation processes , and fuel purification, since water is a very common contaminant in fuels.50", "Figure 3. 5.

Thermal analysis", "Superhydrophobic coatings find applications in many different fields, other than oil/water separation. Since the coating Isob/SiO 2 exhibited superhydrophobicity towards water and saturated brines, superoleophilicity towards eight distinct oils, and excellent adhesion properties, the thermal stability was examined in detail. This can motivate further investigation and the possible use of this coating in different areas where high temperature stability is required. Thermogravimetry is a convenient tool to evaluate the thermal degradation and stability of polymeric materials and composites. Figure 3.6a shows the Isotherm al TGA for the Isob/SiO 2 superhydrophobic/superoleophilic coating at different temperatures over 120 min. No significant weight loss was observed at 100, 150 and 200 °C. This observation validated the curing condition found by chemorheology (section 3.1). Furthermore, it demonstrated that the coating Isob/SiO 2 can be used for high temperature applications. As the temperature increased to 250 °C, a slow degradation occurred, resulting in approximately a 15 % weight loss at 120 minutes.", "Figure 3. 6.

(b) Non -isothermal TGA and (c) TGA first derivative at different heating rates for the Isob/SiO 2 coating. (d) Plots of the Kissinger and modified Ozawa equations. All TGA tests were performed under N 2.", "The non -isothermal TGA for the Isob/SiO 2 coating at different heating rates is shown in Figure 3.6b. The degradation profiles exhibited two prominent steps, in agreement with other works about IBMA -derived polymers.56,57 The possible degradation mechanism is a ssociated with the loss of the side moieties of IBMA (that is, the isobornyl ring) through a McLafferty type rearrangement reaction, followed by the degradation of the polymer backbone/network. Ozlem and coworkers studied the thermal degradation of poly(is obornyl acrylate) and poly(isobornyl methacrylate) via pyrolysis mass spectrometry, elucidating possible mechanism pathways.58 When the heating rate increased, the weight loss rate decreased due to heat transfer limitations, as illustrated by the conco mitant increase of T 10% with the heating rate (Table 3.2). The thermal lag effect was further evidenced by the DTG curves (Figure 3.6c), as the peak temperatures shifted to higher temperatures when the heating rate increased (Table 3.2). The high intensity of the first DTG peak in comparison to the second one is related to the chemical structure of the Isob/SiO 2 coating, which has a high IBMA concentration.", "Table 3. 2.

The Kissinger model (equation 4),59 initially developed for differentia l scanning calorimetry (DSC), was later demonstrated to be applicable to TGA.60 In addition, the modified Ozawa model (equation 5) has been widely employed for kinetic calculations based on TGA", "ln(𝛽 𝑇𝑑2)=ln(𝐴𝑅 𝑅𝑇𝑑", "where 𝛽 is the heating rate, 𝐴 is the frequency factor, 𝑅 is the gas constant, 𝑇𝑑 is the on -set temperature of degradation, 𝐸𝑎 is the activation energy of thermal degradation, and 𝐶 is a constant.", "Both models rely on the fact that the plot of a function of the heating rate versus the reciprocal absolute temperature gives a straight line, and the activation energy can be calculated from its slope. While some works reported 𝐸𝑎 values based on only t hree heating rates ,63,64 we have used four heating rates in this study for accuracy purposes. Figure 3.6d shows the plot of ln(𝛽𝑇𝑑2⁄ ) as well as ln(𝛽) as a function of 1𝑇𝑑⁄ according to the models of Kissinger and Ozawa, respectively. As shown in the figure, straight lines were obtained for both models, exhibiting very high correlation coefficient (table 3.2). Finally, the 𝐸𝑎 was calculated as 115.6 and 119.2 kJ/mol for the Kissinger and Ozawa models, respectively.", "4. Conclusions", "This work demonstrated a facile method to fabricate a fluorine -free superhydrophobic/superoleophilic coating with high thermal stability based on a cyclic methacrylate. Silica nanoparticles were successfully used as roug hening agents for the coating, leading to a significant increase in its water contact angle, and surface roughness parameters ( 𝑅𝑎 and 𝑅𝑞), exhibiting a multiscale texturing which explained the superhydrophobic character of the coating Isob/ SiO 2. Besides, the coating Isob/ SiO 2 was also superoleophilic towards eight different oils of wide industrial interest: gasoline, diesel, petroleum e ther, kerosene, hexane, toluene, chloroform and dichloromethane . The superhydrophobic/superoleophilic coating exhibited excellent adhesion properties according to ASTM standards, and shear rate/turbulence tests. Also, it presented an outstanding (> 99 %) s eparation efficiency of not only mixtures of water and eight types of oil, but also mixtures of hexane and three saturated brines (NaCl, KCl and MgSO 4). The Isob/ SiO 2 coating maintained its high separation efficiency of water/ hexane even after being recycled for 30 times. Isothermal and non -isothermal TGA highlighted the superior thermal stability of the Isob/ SiO 2 coating, which was well described by the Kissinger and Ozawa models. The chemical robustness and versatility of this polymeric coatin g might be attractive to clean up oil spills from different sources and activities in harsh environments.", "5.

On the u se of an agro waste, Miscanthus x. Giganteus , as filtrate r educer for water-based drilling fluids", "ABSTRACT During drilling operations, the influx of liquids to the producing zones can cause wellbore instability problems and decrease the well’s productivity. Different additives are used as filtrate reducers in water -based drilling fluids (WBFs). The growing need of more sustainable drilling operations motivates the incorporation of residues and waste in WBFs formulations. This study reports the evaluation of Miscanthus x. Giganteous (MxG) fines as filtrate reducers in WBFs, promoting the valorization of this agro waste. MxG was characterized by FTIR, and the spectra exhibited characteristic bands of its major constituents. The MxG size reduction was performed by grinding and sieving it through #100, 200 and 325 mesh screens, and the particle size distribution was obtained by optical microscopy. TGA results showed that the sieved MxG grass fines exhibited thermal stability in the range for use in deep and ultra -deep wells, and the degradation profiles were dependent on the average particle size. The filtration prope rties of all WBFs studied were well described by Darcy’s law, allowing the determination of the spurt loss volume. The filtration performance of the WBFs was significantly improved when the average particle size of the MxG fines decreased, exhibiting compa rable or superior results than other materials obtained by more complex, solvent -dependent, expensive and time -consuming processes described in literature.", "Keywords: filtration; filtrate reducer; Miscanthus x. Giganteous ; agro waste; drilling fluids;", "1. In troduction", "Water -based drilling fluids (WBFs) are the leading fluid system used in drilling operations worldwide, since they are less expensive and more environmentally friendly than the synthetic -based drilling fluids.1–3 WBFs formulations vary in complexity depending mostly on the oil well construction parameters (such as number of sections, geometry, depth, temperature/pressure gradients, geological composition and hardness), and aim to provide a fast and secure operatio n, minimizing damage to the formation.4 Wellbore instability problems like differential sticking and decreased productivi ty are generally caused by rock -fluid interactions associated with a high degree of invasion of fluids to the formation.5,6 These problems considerably increase the time and cost of the oil well construction, account ing for the loss of hundreds of millions dollars per year.7 Drilling fluids must be able to produce a thin, low permeability membrane on the formation walls known as mudcake. The suspension of fine particles that enters the formation while the mudcake is being formed is known as the spurt loss, and the liquid that e nters subsequently is known as the filtrate. Therefore, both the spurt loss and the filtrate must be minimized during drilling operations, especially when penetrating potentially productive zones.4,6,8 –10 Bentonite clay is largely used in WBFs, as it contributes to their rheological and filtration properties. It has unique colloidal properties due to its layered structure, high cation exchange capacity, and high chemica l and mechanical stability.9,11,12 However, other chemical additives are necessary in the WBF formulation to effectively control filtration. Different additives have been used as filtrate reducers for drilling fluids, such as: starch, carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC), hydroxyethyl cellulose (HEC)3, cell ulose nanocrystals (CNC)13, terpolymers5, silica -g-polymers8,14, graphene oxide15, and nanocomposites16. Particularly, the Prof. Lucas group has investigated the efficiency of microspheres of poly(methyl methacrylate -co-vinyl acetate)17–19, synthetic -based aphrons20, and hydrophobically modified starch as filtrate reducers21.", "Despite the increasing effort to incorporate natural waste or residues originating from agricultural and industrial processes in biocomposites, there still is an incalculable amount of underutilized resources. Miscanthus x Giganteous (MxG) is a perennial, non -invasive, grass hybrid, and high yield crop that has attracted increasing attention for biofuel production and biocomposites reinforcement.22,23 MxG is a fast -growing crop even in colde r climates such as the Midwest of the United States, as it can grow up to 3.6 meters tall in a two year period, and due to its ability to store nutrients and carbohydrates, it can be harvested for up to 15 -20 years without being replanted. According to lit erature, approximately 80 -85% of MxG chemical composition comprises of cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin, which explains its biotechnological resource potential.24,25 This study attempted to promote the valorization of an agro waste, MxG fines, by its size reduction and incorporation in WBF formulations as filtrate reducers. MxG grass fines were characterized by Fourier -transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), and the sizing was performed by g rinding and sieving. The thermal properties of the sieved MxG fines were evaluated by non -isothermal and isothermal thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and the filtration properties of WBF formulations containing MxG were evaluated according to the American Petroleum Institute (API) standards. To the best of our knowledge, there is no previous report of the use of MxG fines as filtrate reducers in WBFs.", "2. Experimental part", "2.1. Sample preparation", "MxG grass fines were kindly supplied by Aloterra LLC, and t hey were used as received. The fines were further grinded using a domestic mixer, equipped with a stainless steel 4 -blade end.26 After grinding, the particles were sieved in a sonic sifter equipped with #100 , 200 and 325 mesh screens (with pore openings of 149, 74 and 44 µm, respectively).23 Bentonite (BTN) clay was don ated by Southern Clay Chemicals Inc., USA (now BYK, Altana).", "2.2. Characterization", "The FTIR spectrum was obtained using a Cary 600 series FTIR spectrometer (Agilent Technologies, USA) having a GladiATR sample stage (Pike Technologies, USA). Non -isothermal thermal stability characterization was carried out using a thermogravimetric analyzer Q500 (TA Instruments, USA) from 100 to 900 °C with a heating rate of 10 °C/min, under N 2 protection; isothermal characterization was performed at 150, 200 and 250 °C, un der N 2 atmosphere for 120 min.", "2.3. Particle size distribution", "The sieved MxG grass fines were spread onto a microscopic glass slide, and several images were acquired in an optical microscope BH (Olympus, Japan). For each mesh screen, 75 particles were ra ndomly selected, and the length and diameter of the particles were individually measured with the equipment’s software. It is noteworthy to say that each particle was labeled before measurement in order to avoid duplicates.22 For comparative purposes, particle size distributions curves were built, showing the frequency and accumulated frequency of the length, width and aspect ratio ranges.", "2.4. WBFs preparation", "BTN clay was dispersed in distilled water in different concentrations (2.5, 5.0 and 7.5 wt%), and the WBFs were vigorously stirred with a high -speed mixer HMD400 (Hamilton Beach, USA) at approximately 20,000 rpm for 10 min. M xG grass fines were incorporated at different concentrations (0.1, 0.3 and 0.5 wt%) to the WBFs containing BTN clay, and the resulting fluid was stirred for further 10 min under the same conditions. The MxG concentrations were chosen to aim an easy dispers ion in the fluid, and good cost - benefit.", "2.5. Filtration tests", "The freshly prepared WBFs were tested in a standard filter press equipment (OFITE, USA), using standard filter papers (OFITE, USA) according to the API 13B -1 standard.27 For each run, the filter paper was placed in the stainless steel filtration cell (OFITE, USA), and the WBF was carefully poured into the cell. After assembling the filtration cell in the filter press, the cell was pressurized at 100 psi using a Nitrogen tank, and the volumes of filtrate were determined at 1.0, 7.5, 15.0, 20.0 and 30.0 min using a graduated cylinder (Figure 4.1). All the filtration tests were performed at 25 °C, in triplicate, and the results are the average of the measurements (standard deviation was < 5%).13 The volume of filtrate at 30 min is known as V API.", "Figure 4. 1. Schematic representation of the filtration apparatus.", "3. Results and discussion", "3.1. Characterization", "Plant cell walls provide the bulk of a plant’s biomass and they largely consist of cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin. It is well established in plant anatomy that cellulose, as the structural framework of plant cell walls, is organized in microfibrils (F igure 4.2a). These cellulosic structures are surrounded by a matrix of polysaccharides, including hemicellulose and lignin, that crosslink the microfibrils into a complex network (Figure 4.2b).28,29 Lignin, traditionally described as being derived from three hydroxycinnamyl alcohols (p -coumaryl, coniferyl and sinapyl), contributes to the mechanical strength of the plant cell walls, as well as the hydrophobicity to allow transport of water and nutrients through the vascular system.30 The hemicellulose xyloglucan associates to the cellulose microfibrils throug h hydrogen bonds. The strong chemical interactions and the networked structure are responsible for the mechanical strength of plant cell walls.31,32 The chemical structures of cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin are shown in the Figure 4.2c.", "Figure 4. 2. (a) Representations of a cellulosic microfibril surrounded by a hemicellulose layer; (b) plant cell wall, mainly constituted by cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin; (c) chemical structures of cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin.", "Figure 4.3 shows the FTIR spec trum of the non -sieved MxG fines. In general, the MxG fines exhibited characteristic bands of its major constituents, namely cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin, which account on average for over 80% of its chemical composition.22–24 Cons idering that cellulose and hemicellulose polysaccharides have backbone chains composed of β -glycosidic linkage, an IR band in the range of 870 -900 cm-1 is expected.33 The absorbance at 896 cm-1 was attributed to C –C or C –O vibrat ions coupled with the C –H mode of the anomeric carbon of cellulosic β -conformers. The broad absorbance in the range of 3680 -2980 cm-1 is due to the hydrogen bonded O -H stretching vibration, commonly found in other polysaccharides of similar chemical archit ecture, such as xanthan gum and starch.34 The peak at 2895 cm-1 indicates the C -H stretching vibration of methyl, methylene and methyne groups, whereas the C -H bending vibration in methyl groups was found at 1460 -1420 cm-1. The peak found at 1263 c m-1 was associated with the C -O stretching vibration in guaiacol rings, and the shoulder found at 1243 cm-1 was attributed to the C -O stretching vibration in syringol rings.32,35 The intense absorbances at 1140 -1030 cm-1 was due to the C -O-C stretching vibrations of glucosidic bonds, and O -H bending of alcohol groups.36 The peak at 1160 cm-1 is typical of arabinoxylans in hemicellulose, whereas the peak at 1507 cm-1 is related to its hexenuronic acids ramification. The skeletal vibrations of lignin were observed in the range of 1757 -1530 cm-1, as well as the C=O vibration of ketone groups at 2358 cm-1.35,37", "Figure 4. 3. FTIR spectrum of the MxG grass.", "3.2. Particle size distribution", "Different biomass sources were tested as filtrate reducers in water -based drilling fluids, such as: rice husk38, groundnut husk39, walnu t shell40, and sugar cane ash.41 However, the influence of the particle size on their filtration properties has received very limited attention. In order to evaluate the effect of the particle size of the MxG grass fines on the filtration properties of aqueous fluids, the MxG grass fines were sieved through #100 , 200 and 325 mesh screens. Figure 4.4 shows the optical microscopy images of the sieved particles. For all groups of sieved particles, the majority of the particles showed a cylindrical -like shape. As expected, the particle size decreased as the pore ope ning of the screens became smaller. Figure 4.5 shows the particle size distribution curves for the sieved MxG grass fines, including the length (L), width (D) and aspect ratio (L/D).", "Figure 4. 4.

As the pore opening became smaller, the length and width distributions shifted to lower values and became increasingly sharper. On the other hand, the aspect ratio distribution increased with a reduction of the pore opening (Fi gure 4.5c). The average length, width and aspect ratio for the MxG grass fines sieved by #100, 200 and 325 mesh screens are shown in Table 4.1.

(a) Length, (b) width and (c) aspect ratio distribution curves for the MxG grass fines sieved by # 100, 200 and 325 mesh screens.", "Khullar and coworkers23 grinded MxG grass using a hammer mill equipped with screens having 0.08, 2.00 or 6.00 mm sieve openings. The resulting particles were subjected to different treatments (hot water, dilute acid or dilute ammonium hydroxide), followed by enzymatic hydrolysis. Across all treatments, the total conversion to glucose and xylose increased up to 32% when the particle size decreased from 6.00 to 0.08 mm for all treatments. Red -oak sawdust was sieved in a set of mesh screens (#20, 30, 40, 80, 100, 140 and 200), generating different groups of particle sizes that separately underwent enzymatic hydr olysis. The particle size had a remarkable effect on the glucose production and the viscosity of the wood particle slurries. When comparing the particles in the range of 150 µm < x ≤ 180 µm with the ones in the range of 33 µm < x ≤ 75 µm, the viscosity of the cellulosic slurries decreased almost 50 times when the particle size decreased, whereas the glucose production increased approximately 20%.47 Rice straw was broken down into different sizes using a hammer mill with pore openings ranging from 25.40 mm to 1.59 mm, and some mechanical properties of particleboards made with the hammer -milled particles and commercial resins were evaluated. The perfo rmance of the biocomposite materials was strongly dependent on the rice straw particle size. When the pore opening decreased from 25.40 mm to 1.59 mm, the internal bond strength increased approximately 65%, the modulus of rupture decreased approximately 60 %, and the modulus of elasticity decreased approximately 40%.48", "3.3. Thermal characterization", "The thermal decomposition behavior of the sieved MxG grass fines was evaluated by using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) in non -isothermal and isothermal conditions. Figure 4.6a shows the TGA curves for the sieved MxG grass fines particles at 10 °C/min, under Nitrogen atmosphere. For all the sieved particles, there was no significant thermal degradation up to approximately 214 °C, when the particles start to decompose abruptly up to 380 °C. Until this temperature, the thermal behavior was essentially the same, irrespective of the particle size. Interestingly, above 380 °C, the thermal decomposition was governed by the particle size (as highlighted in the inlet of the Figure 4.6a). The char yield at 900 °C for the MxG grass fines sieved by the # 100, 200 an d 325 mesh screens were of 15.4, 14.6 and 14.3 %, respectively. In other words, the smaller the average particle size, the higher was the thermal degradation rate. This observation can be explained in terms of heat transfer principles, as a decreased parti cle size leads to an increase in heat transfer.49,50", "Figure 4. 6. (a) TGA curves of the sieved MxG grass fines at 10 °C/min, under N 2; inlet shows an amplification of the TGA curves. (b) DTG curve of the MxG grass fines sieved by the # 200 mesh screen.", "The differential thermogravimetric (DTG) curve for the MxG grass fines sieved by the # 200 mesh screen is depicted in Figure 4.6b. The DTG curves for the particles sieved by the #100 and 325 mesh screens shown the same number of degradation stages, and the peak maximums were in the same temperatures of the sample sieved by # 200 mesh screen. Therefore, the DTG curves of the particles sieved by the #100 and 325 mesh screens were omitted in Figure 4.6b for simplification. The DTG curve show the occurrence of three main degradation events. In the range of 200 to 400 °C, the peak temperatures observed at approximately 313 and 363 °C are respectively associated with the decomposition of hemicellulose and cellulose, which are major constituents of MxG grass.23,24 In this range, higher molecular weight compounds fragmented into smaller molecular weight compounds by applying continuous heat. The reported values are in good agreement with the peaks’ shapes and temperatures reported by Mishra and Mohanty51 for pine sawdust and sal sawdust. Finally, at around 419 °C, th e complex and high -molar mass organic compounds formed through pyrolysis of cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin molecules degrade.50 The steady TGA/DTG curves at high temperature indicates the complete conversion of the biomass to char . Oil well drilling operations can last from days to weeks, depending on the characteristics of the well, drilling parameters that affect the rate of penetration (such as type of bit, weight on bit, rotation, hydraulics, and efficiency of well cleaning), a s well as economical, logistical and environmental factors.1,4,6,34,52 Given the decline of the shallow, easily exploited oil reserves, the development of the deep and ultra -deep wells has increased. These types of wells have bottom hole circulating temperatures higher than 120 and 180 °C, respectively, and higher pressures.14 Taking into consideration the time and temperature components inv olved in oil well drilling operations, isothermal TGA is a convenient tool to assess the thermal stability of the chemical additives.", "Figure 4.7 shows the isothermal TGAs of the sieved MxG grass fines at 150, 200 and 250 °C, under Nitrogen atmosphere. Afte r being heated at 150 °C for 120 min, all groups of sieved particles presented a consistent thermal stability (Figure 4.7a). When the temperature was increased to 200 °C, although a slow thermal degradation was observed, only less than 2% weight losses occ urred at 120 min for all groups of sieved particles (Figure 4.7b). Therefore, the sieved MxG grass fines showed satisfactory thermal stability in the temperature range of deep and ultra -deep wells. When the sieved MxG grass fines were heated at 250 °C, who se temperature is in the range associated with the hemicellulose degradation, the obvious slope in the isothermal TGA curves was observed (Figure 4.7c). Moreover, the thermal degradation was governed by the average particle size (as highlighted in the inle t of the Figure 4.7c). This trend can be explained in terms of heat transfer principles, as previously discussed.", "Figure 4. 7.

Figure 4.9 shows the plot of the volume of filtrate against the squared root of time for the fluids #1 -3. All the fluids in this study were well described by the Darcy’s law (R2 > 0.99), and the respective V sp and V API are reported in the Table 4.2.", "Figure 4. 9. Plot of volume of filtrate against the squared root of time for fluids #1 -3, under 100 psi at 25 °C.", "The fluids #1 -3 evaluated the effect of the BTN clay on the filtration properties of aqueous fluids (Figure 4.8a). Increased concentration of BTN clay led to reduced filtrate volumes. When the BTN clay concentration decreased from 7.5 to 2.5 wt%, the V API increased from 8.6 to 25.0 mL, and the V sp increased from 0.7 to 5.1 mL. BTN is a relatively inexpensive, na turally abundant clay mineral that has been largely used in drilling fluids formulations due to its physicochemical characteristics, affecting the rheological and filtration properties. When dispersed in water, BTN clay can provide desirable shear -thinning behavior, gel strength to maintain drilled fines in suspension, and contribute to the wall -building structure, reducing the filtration to the formation.6,11 Considering that 5.0 and 7.5 wt% of BTN clay resulted in lower filtration profiles, it would be harder to evaluate the effect of filtrate reducers with those concentrations of clay. Also, high concentrations of BTN clay lead to thicker mudcakes, which can cause serious differential pressure sticking and stuck pipe problems.6 Li and coworkers13 evaluated the effect of microfibrilated cellulose and cellulose nanocrystals on the filtration properties of WBFs. Firstly, they tested five concentrations of BTN clay ranging from 3 to 15 wt%. Secondly, they fixed the concentration of BTN clay at 3 wt%, which had the highest V API, and then incorporated the pr oposed filtrate reducers to demonstrate their efficiency in reducing filtration.", "Therefore, the BTN clay concentration was fixed at 2.5 wt%, and the MxG grass fines were incorporated to the subsequent formulations. The fluids #4 -6 evaluated the effect of t he non -sieved MxG grass fines (NS MxG) in the WBF containing 2.5 wt% of BTN clay (Figure 4.8b). When 0.1 wt% of non -sieved MxG was added (fluid #4), both the V sp and V API increased if compared to the fluid #1 containing solely BTN clay. At this concentrati on, probably there are not enough sufficiently small particles to block the pores and reduce filtration at the early stages of the mudcake build -up, as well as throughout time. When the concentration of NS MxG increased from 0.1 to 0.3 wt% (fluids #4 and 5 , respectively), there was a slight decrease in the V sp and the V API. However, when the NS MxG reached 0.5 wt% (Fluid #6), there was a considerable drop in the filtration parameters, where the V sp and the V API decreased 79 and 41%, respectively. Thus, this concentration of NS MxG (0.5 wt%) was chosen to specifically evaluate the effect of the particle size of the MxG grass fines on the filtration properties of WBFs.", "Table 4. 2.

Initially, when using the #100 mesh screen sieved particles (fluid # 7), both the V sp and V API increased if comp ared to the fluid #1, confirming the negative effect of large particles on the filtration properties. When using the #200 mesh screen sieved particles (fluid #8), the V sp significantly decreased from 17.1 to 3.9 mL, and and the V API decreased from 34.0 to 21.8. Finally, when using the #325 mesh screen sieved particles (fluid # 9), the filtration parameters further decreased. In other words, the #325 mesh screen sieved particles were able to form a more densely packed, less permeable mudcake (Figure 4.10b), if compared to the ones sieved through the #100 mesh, which are longer, wider, and have a smaller aspect ratio (Figure 4.10a).

Conclusions", "The Miscanthus x Giganteous (MxG) grass fines were characterized by FTIR, and the spectra exhibited characteristic bands of constituted of cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin, which are its major constituents. MxG was first evaluated as filtrate reducer in water -based drilling fluids (WBFs). The thermal degradation profiles were slightly dependent on the average particle size of MxG fines, nevertheless the filtration performance of the WBFs was significantly imp roved as the MxG particle size decreased. All WBFs studied were well described by Darcy’s law, allowing the determination of the spurt loss volume.", "Considering that (i) MxG is a naturally abundant, fast -growing crop; (ii) there was not any chemical treatm ent in the MxG grass fines evaluated in this work; (iii) size -reducing was easily performed by grinding and sieving; (iv) MxG grass fines exhibited thermal stability in the range of deep and ultradeep wells; and (v) sieved MxG grass fines by # 325 mesh scr een showed comparable or superior filtration performance than other materials obtained by more complex, solvent -dependent, expensive and time - consuming processes described in literature; this study promoted the valorization of an agro waste, MxG grass fine s, which revealed to be an inexpensive, and promising filtrate reducer additive for WBFs.

In search of organizational growth, companies seek to introduce nov elties or to adapt to changing environments, especially more frequently and intensely in emerging countries like Brazil. The attractive and dynamic business environment has been an invitation for several multinational companies in the oil products sector t o enter the country. Dozens of these companies from diverse origins, strategies and international experiences have established business in this industry in Brazil. Some operated in the country for decades, others for nearly a century, and others for just a few years. Currently, this centenary market is mostly concentrated in the hands of three companies. The only remaining multinational company in the Brazilian oil products market is Shell, which has been operating in the country for over a century, and it was the choice for this case study. Thus, this work investigated the management challenges of a multinational with over a century experience on operating in Brazil. With the aim of studying the challenges of organizational growth in dynamic business enviro nments, this study used a longitudinal perspective of investigation drawing on oral history with a collection of in-depth accounts of personal experiences and reflections on the phenomenon in focus, in addition to the use of voluminous secondary sources an d visual maps. This work introduces an original theoretical component to Fleck's model, based on the Integration -Responsiveness framework. The extended model provides a more informed view on the challenges of organizational growth of multinational companie s, taking a step forward in the frontier of knowledge on the topic of organizational healthy survival. As a contribution to management practices, this research proposes to evaluate international, multinational, global or transnational management strategies vis a vis the central drivers of growth, to identify or predict the actual and ideal states of organizational existence.

Managers’ reactions to such challenges usually imply an increase or decrease in the chances of organizational survival. Most companies aspire to health ily survive , being longevit y a prevalent key indicator of success (ORTIZ -VILLAJOS; SOTOCA, 2018) . In the management literature there are many factors that influence organizational survival. However, nearly all firms ’ managers and several academics who contribute to the strategy literature suggest that firms shou ld experience survival benefits from growth . A management pattern found in companies is the search for growth. Organizational growth is an almost indisputable guideline in management practices and research. In reality, the motives for growth are diverse and difficult if not impossible to know, as they emanate from the decision -making process and the goals pursued b y the individual members of the organization (STARBUCK, 1965) . A common issue in the field is that growth brings management challenges to organizations (FLECK, 2009, 2018) .", "Brazil has offered considerable growth opportunit ies as well management challenge s for oil and energy enterprises . Today, there are 160 oil product s distributors authorized to operate in the country and the oil products market has been steadily growing for a long time (see Figure 1).", "Oil and Gas m ultinational enterprises (MNEs) have taken up growth opportunities in Brazil, nevertheless they also have faced growth challenges in Figure 1 – Oil Products Consump tion in Brazil", "Source: National Oil Agency (ANP) an environment full of turbulence and pressures for chan ge along their histories in this country. Shell has been operating its businesses in Brazil for more than one century. When it started in Brazil i n 1913, the country was already going through a serious economic crisis . Throughout its operations in Brazil, Shell witnessed 3 coups d'état in 1930, 1945 and 1964, a long period of military dictatorship from 1964 to 1985, 5 federal constitutions1, 2 major world wars, nationalization campaigns and government ordinances , periods of hyperinflation, foreign debt moratorium , fiscal crises, market regulation, price and margin setting by the government, captive market practices, market deregulation, unfair competition through tax evasion pra ctices and fuel adulteration, 4 presidential impeachments2, energy supply crises , political instabilit ies, etcetera . While Shell has resisted the challenges found in the Brazilian business environment along decades and decades, the same has not happened w ith other multinational oil companies. Atlantic was a subsidiary of the American firm Atlantic Richfield Company (ARCO). The company started operations in Brazil in 1922 and exited in 1993, being sold to Ipiranga – a local oil company. Texaco, also an Amer ican company, entered th e country in 1915 and exited in 2008 when it was sold to Ipiranga as well. Repsol, a Spanish company, came to Brazil in 1997 and exited its downstream business in 2008, being sold to Ale, another local oil company. Agip, an Italian oil company entered in Brazil in 1998 and exited in 2004, being sold to Petrobras, the largest and the national oil company in Brazil. ExxonMobil was the pioneer MNE in Brazil, having entered the country in 1912 and exited the business in 2008. Instead of exiting, as it occurred with those distinct multinational companies in the Brazilian oil sector , Shell responded to the growth challenges (FLECK, 2009) imposed by an inhospitable business environment (FLECK, 2009, 2011, Forthcome ) with various strategic and organizationa l changes. Among numerous changes stand out laying off a large portion of its workforce, creating and making use of service centers around the world to provide support activities of its value chain to the Brazilian and other countries’ market, streamlining", "2 Impeached presidents: Carlos Luz (1955), Café Filho (1955), Fernando Collor (1992) and Dilma Roussef processes, standardizing its product portfolio with global brands, selling businesses, depleting assets, regionalizing the organizational structure, thereafter, globalizing it. Most of these changes occurred from the 1990’s to the beginning of the 2000’s.", "In this period a great wave of globalization boosted flows of trade, capital, human resources, and information, notably influencing international business and MNEs management. In Brazil, the market liberalization process was underway, giving rise to unfa ir competition practices, including tax evasion and fuel adulteration by many competitors called \"white flag\" (indicating their unbranded characteristic).", "Shell transferred its subsidiaries activities of information technology, human resources, procuremen t, credit analysis, accounts payable, accounts receivable, and treasury to service’s hubs in other parts of the world, global brands were introduced in the Brazilian portfolio of products , processes were streamlined, and a global enterprise resource planni ng application was implemented. Nevertheless, pressures over cost reduction at Shell did not cease. Reports indicate that Shell ’s organization in Brazil consisted of political silos and coalitions that resulted in a certain degree of organizational sticki ness . New organizational structures were planned, but not implemented or returned to the way they were before. Some bad investments were made, and the results put pressures for more change.", "More than one quarter of Shell's workforce was laid off, its market share decreased from 21% to 12% and the company's image with its customers deteriorated. Shell decided not to exit the country, although it tried. Instead, in 2011 the company formed a joi nt venture with Cosan, a large local firm, currently known as a Brazilian multinational conglomerate producer of bioethanol, sugar, and energy.", "From the formation of the joint venture between Shell and Cosan, the Raízen company emerged. Currently, a decad e has passed since its existence and during this period many signs of success were exhibited by the new company. Figure 2 shows the change in the level Shell’s success measured by its market share before and after the JV. Clearly, i t is possible to see that the company's market share in the period prior to Raízen grew timidly, a result of a decade full of challenges, trials, and errors on the part of the company’s management . In contrast, the first decade of the formation of the joint venture with Cosan shows a shift in Shell's level of success, as measured by its market share growth.", "The success of Shell in Brazil has occurred in a scenario where several multinational companies, including ExxonMobil, the world's leading oil and gas company in market capitalization (SÖNNICHSEN, 2021) , exited the oil product s business in Brazil . In different industries, several MNEs have likewise exited the country . Table 1 shows some of the MNEs that exited the country either totally or at least from one of their business units. This incomplete yet vast list of companies of different sizes, industries and ages seems to show that this is an unexpected regularity (VON KROGH; ROSSI -LAMASTRA; HAEFLIGER, 2012) problem that deserves further study.", "Considering that growth expectations that are not met generally lead to decisions towards exiting the business (DECKER; MELLEWIGT, 2007) , it is possible to state that the theory of organizational growth (CHANDLER, 1977, 1990; FLECK, 2009, 2018, forthcoming ; PENROSE, 1959) is a fundamental theoretical framework that can explain the ph enomenon in question . In her seminal work , Penrose (1959, p. 239) asserts that her theory “seems by and large to apply equally well to expansion by direct foreign investment in its modern form ,” indicating the appropriateness o f her theory for assessing the growth phenomenon through the focused MNE.

Therefore, research is needed to investigate whether growth offers survival benefits in dynamic environments like Brazil and t he Shell ’s case offers this possibility. Thus, the purpose of this study is to shed light on the growth challenges that management faces in a promising but also dynamic business environment.", "The Shell ’s case offers a rich variety of organizational management elements to be studied, providing a great opportunity for research ing.

For example, data showed that Shell migrat ed a series of support activities from its subsidiaries to service centers worldwide, increas ing or at least intended to increase its global integration . However, these changes may have hampered management's ability to respond to different local demands, especially in the volatile environment observed in the country at that time. These global services were charged through intercompany transactions, increasing the s ubsidiary exposure to foreign currencies. The distance and detachment from the local market led to lengthy decision making and inefficiency in responding to the demands of the local market. These factors, among others, may not have offset cost savings. Therefore, another theoretical framework that may provide answers to the presented problem is the Integration - Responsiveness (I/R) model (BARTLETT; GHOSHAL, 1987) , completing the selected theories to b e assessed in a later chapter of this research. This research is significant because its lessons potentially help increase the permanence of companies in operation in dynamic environments , avoiding unfavorable consequences of business exiting . The consequences of business exits are generally related to divestitures with high impact events in macro (e.g. employment), industry (e.g. industry concentration, size, and competitive structure), firm (e.g. performance, ownership, organizational structures, strategy ) and individual levels (e.g. motivation, commitment, emotion al state ) (BRAUER, 2006) . Avoiding the negative side of those consequences means pushing the organization to its healthy surviva l state. This work also aimed at verifying and make progress on Fleck’s framework for assessing the potential and actual state of organizational survival (FLECK, 2018, forthcoming ). Lastly , theoretical contributions advanced conceptual frameworks or concepts within the problem (GRANT; OSANLOO, 2014) , that constitute the theories of organizational growth and the I/R model.", "In the sections that follow a review will be made on the theory of growth (CHANDLER, 1977, 1990; FLECK, 2009, 2018, forthcoming ; PENROSE, 1959) and on the Integration -Responsiveness (BARTLETT; GHOSHAL, 1987) theoretical frameworks. The methods of collecting and analyzing data were then described, the analyses an d findings were provided and finally, a discussion of the findings and the conclusion complete this work.", "2 LITERATURE REVIEW", "2.1. THE THEORY OF GROWTH", "Almost indisputably by both enterprises and academic circles is the idea that companies need growth. Growth is considered the path that will lead to organizational success (DAVIDSSON; STEFFENS; FITZSIMMONS, 2009) and also commonly viewed as a requirement for organizational survival (FLECK, 2018) . Nevertheless, research has long warned that dealing with growth is a serious management problem (WHETTEN, 1980) . Moreover, the growth process can promote , but may also preclude organizational continued existence (FLECK, 2018, forthcoming ).", "Growth paths can be viewed within distinct perspective s. Fleck (2000) proposed a framework of modes of change as it is summarized in Table 2. If these are the possible paths to growth what would growth itself be? Organizational growth can be observed according to change in size, change in Table 2 – Growth Paths Growth Path Description Quantitative Business as usual counting on routine expansion that reproduce current unaltered operations.", "Goal -directed Growth goals defined at the beginning of a certain period are pursued, triggering its process and path, consequently bringing the conception of operating and investment procedures for achieving global objectives of performance.", "Dialectical Misfits, imbalances, or conflicts bring about innovation in products, processes, or services, which demand new operational procedures that reconcile opposing or conflicting objectives, demanding from the organization's members the ability to deal with a series of tensions.", "Interactionally -developed Growth is carried out in a competitive manner, where the actions to achieve it are interdepend ent on the actions of rivals or cooperatively, where actions towards growth interdepend on the actions of partners, promoting standardization that can take growth to the market where firms compete.", "Opportunity -led Threats and opportunities are responded o r anticipated by the organization.", "Structural The relations existed in the industry determine growth. Without power, firms follow rules imposed by powerful competitors, who in turn grow by change the balance of power of the industry.

A summary of these three constructs of the organizational growth perspective is presented in Table 3. 2.1.1. GROWTH AS A CHANGE IN SIZE Several indicators can be used to observe organizational growth through measures of changes in size. Nonetheless, depending on the study purpose and the theoretical perspective being used, one can find issues related to these indicators. The effects of tim e on size indicators – such as inflation – should be adequately treated in longitudinal studies. In addition, the portfolio of the firm activities and the diversity of multi -business entities should be adjusted to compare findings cross -industry and make cross -firm analyses. Finally, it is also needed to identify declining trajectories of the organization vis -à-vis the Table 3 – The Growth Perspectives Growth Perspective Growth Signals Observable Evidence Change in size • Firms grow according to the total of their resources (including personnel) used for their own productive purposes.", "• Firms grow according to the number of transactions controlled within a firm’s boundaries at a particular point in time.", "• Firms grow according to relative measures of size, normally adjusted to a common scale in a sample of population. • Sales, assets , employees , dividends, EPS, ROI, profits, market share, customers, capital market, production output , installed capacity, percentage of a firm’s annual sales relative to the annual size of th e relevant economic system, showed by aggregate measures like GNP and GDP .", "Change in kind • The degree of additions of novelties leads to growth.

In the academic sphere, it is essential to choose the appropriate constr uct for the sake of theory advancement. At the very least, it is necessary to clearly define how growth is being measured, to allow replication and continuity of previously carried out research. Weinzimmer, Nystrom and Freeman (1998) also report that there are many inconsistencies related to the goals that lead to organizational growth. Examples were pres ented by those authors showing these inconsistencies raised in studies with similar sample characteristics and divergent results fo und in the relation between growth and size of the senior management team , and other investigations revealing conflicting as sociations between growth and business diversification.", "Such inconsistencies arise from different concepts and measures of growth. Different growth measures are not interchangeable nor show strong correlations . Fleck (2018) recommends as a measure the use of a size indicator relative to an aggregate global, national, international, regional, municipal statistic such as GNP and GDP. The use of this measure has the advantage of adjusting inflationary effects, converting curren cy-based numbers into dimensionless quantities, allows comparisons between sectors and firms, and isolates the firm's increasing and decreasing trajectories, given the economic scenario of the time that influence them. In this work, the effect of measuring growth in this way is illustrated on Figure 3 below .", "2.1.2. GROWTH AS A CHANGE IN KIND", "When the growth phenomenon is observed through change of kind, the organizational renewal can be found in various degrees , from barely to extensive . According to (FLECK, 2018) , two basic drivers serve as poles delimitating the novelty spectrum: inertial and dialectical. These two poles of renewal representation are intrinsic and are seen as primitive driver s because they occur in the sphere of the focal entity.", "The inertial driver or pole is observed when there are routine expansions that reproduce ongoing operations or exploitative activities, without bringing significative qualitative novelty change. The second driver is in the opposite pole, and it is called dialectical, is found when explorative activities are carried out, bringing significant novelty to the organization. The dialectical driver opens new paths in organizations by eliminating incompatibil ities found in trade -offs, tensions, and paradoxes. The expansion through this driver usually generates hybrid business strategies, apparently antagonistic, such as for example combining differentiation with low cost with mass customization offer. Furtherm ore, there are other three drivers to represent the interaction among same levels entities such as competitors, interactions with multilevel Figure 3 – Royal Dutch Shell and ExxonMobil Global Revenues / GDP", "Data Sources: World Bank, Thomson Reuters Eikon ; Author’s elaboration", "2020Revenue / Global GDP x 10-3", "ExxonMobil Royal Dutch Shell businesses such as industries and ecosystems and interactions with the external environment in general. According t o Fleck (2018) , depending on how one reacts to competitive movements, the inertial or dialectical conductor may be activated and, consequently, the organization will experience small to considerable renewal. Likewise, institutional change may require the introduction of minor to substantial novelties in field members. Additionally , external changes can generate responses that can reinforce the org anizational status quo or challenge it considerably, causing the organization to renew itself in ways that are important or not substantially.", "Competitors or partners of the same organization kind can lead minor or moderate renewal potential. In this case, the “interactional” renewal also occurs in the same entity level, including competitors or partners of the same organization kind, leading from minor to moderate renewal potential, to challenging rivals or catching up with rivals’ initiatives. The “stru ctural” driver is a multilevel driver involving coevolution of the whole organization and parts. The effect of change can range from minor in an institutionalized sector or ecosystem to transforming, deinstitutionalizing a sector or an ecosystem, or creati ng a new one, with a substantial potential of change in kind.", "Finally, the called “external” is an extrinsic driver, lying outside the focal entity. It fuels existing activities meeting new needs with existing products or services, achieving minor to mode rate effect on growth, especially when activating the inertial driver or its effects can be moderate to substantial if it activates the dialectical driver, demanding new business approaches.", "2.1.3. GROWTH THROUGH A CHANGE PROCESS", "Growth as a process of change enc ompasses quantitative and qualitative changes that may occur within or around the organization under study. One theoretical approach that makes use of this view of growth as a process of change is the one that studies organizational life cycles (CHURCHILL; LEWIS, 1983; GREINER, 1972; HANKS et al., 1993; QUINN; CAMERON, 1983; WHETTEN, 1987) . However, studies have not found a common understanding of lifecycle model attributes such as the number of stages and su b-stages as organizations develop over time. Moreover, stage models disregard the requirements of the theory of growth , which should “take into account not only of the sequence of changes created by a firm’s own activities but also of the effect of changes that are external to the firm and lie beyond its control” (PENROSE, 1959) . As a result, Levie and Lichtenstein (2010) argued that life or growth cycles should be replaced by cha nges in organizational states, employing a dynamic view in which organizations can operate in different states during their existence and experience different survival conditions, sometimes healthier and sometimes any less. These organizational health cond itions lead to a broader state or view of growth, a state or view of organizational survival, which sees the growth as a process of change consider ing internal and external aspects of the organization. Considering this view , Fleck (2018 , forthcoming ) argues that growth as a change process consists of antecedents, modes of organizational expansion , and organizational consequences, which lead to ideal organizational states related to survival.", "Fleck (2018) claims that there are four kinds of a ntecedents : imbalances or restrictions caused by organizational expa nsion into areas similar to the usual ones (NORMANN, 1977) , entrepreneurship (PENROSE, 1959; SHANE; VENKATARAMAN, 2000) , motivation and p urposes (CHANDLER, 1977; FLECK, 2009) , and availability of human resources (PENROSE, 1959) . The first kind of antecedents, the i mbalances , occur s as a result of natural driving forces related to scarcity of resources, interdependencies (between products and by -products, process and sub -processes, components, and sub -components of current business, fostered by customer needs and production optimization or synergy) or market and technology disturbances and variations (NORMANN, 1977) . The se natural driving forces give rise to what is called \"feeler\", which is the stage at which an idea about the direction of the business is established, thereafter superior products/services or systems to exercise dominance must be developed, financi al resources must be obtained and finally the conquest of territory must be explored and defended.", "The second type of growth antecedent is entrepreneurship , which instead of stimulat ing growth by expanding the organization through usual businesses sparked by imbalances , it brings novelty triggered by creativity, experimentation, technological leadership , and so forth, in both products and services (LYON; LUMPKIN; DESS, 2000) . The third kind of antecedent of the process of growth is the motives or purp oses for the firm expansion , which can be p roductive , defensive, hybrid or nil.", "The productive antecedent of growth was originally observed by Chandler (1977) and represent the search for productivity, lowering unit costs by achieving economies of scale and scope. Defensive antecedents of growth, also originally observed by Chandler, is associated with a desire for security , leading to uncertainties reduction and protection of current businesses, generally involving vertical and horizontal acquisitions seeking to reduce the intensity of competitive forces in the industry. Fleck (2009) found the hybrid and nil antecedent s, being the former related to the use of both productive and defensive growth, which is aligned with the c oncept of empire -building expansion (PENROSE, 1959) and the latter does not apply neither defensive, nor productive growth, and it is associated with the concept of product -minded expansion, which interests are directed towards the improvement of the quality or their products, the reduction of costs, the devel opment of better technology, the extension of markets through better service to consumers, and the introduction of new products in which they believe their firms have a productive or distributive advantage. They take pride in their organization, and from t heir point of view the ‘best’ way to make profits is through the improvement and extension of the activities of this organization. (PENROSE, 1959, p. 36) Finally, the fourth kind of growth antecedent occurs when there are management concerns about making full use of underutilized resources, stimulating the conception of new activities for occupying its idle capacity. This stimulus entails a diversification process that requires further resources, which addition once again would exceed the firm’s nee d, leading to a new process of growth impetus. This cycle represents the continuing growth motor of related diversification proposed by Fleck (2003) .", "As a result o f the antecedents of the growth process , Fleck (2018) advances that organizational expansion occurs through the driver s of growth , inertial, dia lectical, interactional, structural, and externally induced , as discussed seen in section 2.1.2 above . Implementation modes can be organic, acquisition or hybrid. After expansion, the organization will face consequences of increa sed visibility, variety, interconnections, and human resource needs.", "2.1.4. MECHANISMS OF ORGANIZATIONAL GROWTH", "A healthy state of organizational existence requires three growth -related mechanisms of growth are found : renewal, slack and integrity (FLECK, 2018) . Renewal must take place so that management can make organizational adaptation needed, considering the changes that permanently occur in the business environment . Renewal is also necessary when instead of adapting, the organization takes a leadership position implementing innovation to shape the environment (CHILD, 1997) . In both cases, renewal is a vital mechanism to avoid organizational obsolescenc e.", "Therefore, innovation, adaptation and environmental shaping are elements of renewal. Along with the continuous creation of value for stakeholders, including customers and others necessary for an organizational coalition (CYERT; MARCH, 1992) , these elements of renewal seek to ensure organizational legitimacy (SUCHMA N, 1995) . There are several sources of renewal. According to Fleck (FLECK, forthcoming ) renewal can be generated from responses to stakeholder initiatives, can arise from the management of internal and external bonds, can arise from skills and network connections of new hired employees and can be originated and implemente d through an entrepreneurship process. Viewed a s a process of development and organizational change, renewal can be created through four ideal theoretical progressions according to Van de Ven and Poole (1995) : evolution, dialectics, life cycle and teleology.", "Creating and p romoting renewal , as well as overcom ing obstacles it may bring require precautions . Renewal must be promoted together with the adequate capture of value from the existing value creation activities that the company explores. There are several provisions that must be taken in the search and implementation of organizational renewal. It is natural t hat renewal carries uncertainties and risks for the organization, which may harm the company's performance and its predictability (ROSENKOPF; MCGRATH, 2011) . The excessive exploration of new initiatives can harm the capture of value resulting from the exploitation of old ones (MARCH, 1991) . Defensive responses to stakeholder demands can make the company preserve current businesses at the expense of new initiatives (CHRISTENSEN; BOWER, 1996) . The relentless search for renewal can generate paralysis by analysis (LANGLEY, 1995) , generating a failure in the production of innovation. Hiring human resources with a profile similar to the existing staff makes it difficult to renew skills. Finally, functional organizational struc tures are often obstacle to interpreting a new situation or developing feelers (CHANDLE R JR, 1990; NORMANN, 1977) . As renewal can be created, promoted, and developed through entrepreneurship, it can also generate the unwanted and inherent side effects of this process. One of these effects is the transformation of slack into losses, given the uncertainty that characterizes renewal initiatives. The more innovative the initiative, the greater the risk. Another side effect is the pressure for entrepreneurial implementation, which can generate stress and friction in relationships and generate d isintegrative processes that can weaken the social tissue of the organization, going through a cycle in which the renewal implementation becomes full of obstacles or prevented from occur ring. According to Penrose (1959) , slack consists of idle resources previously used for the provision of services, potentially serving as an incentive for organizational growth and renewal . Slack is a cushion that allows organizations to adapt to external or internal pressures for change, it also enables initiat ive changes in strategy with respect to the external environment (BOURGEIOIS, Nohria and Gulati, (1997) define slack as “the pool of resources in an organization that is in excess of the minimum necessary to produce a given level of organizational output. ” It may also reflect organizational inefficie ncy, as a pool of resources exceeding the minimum necessary for normal operation and has not been optimally deployed .", "Thus, on the one hand, slack can promote organizational growth and renewal, but on the other hand, simply its mere presence in the organiz ation or its use in an inadequate dosage or in other words, making use of too much or too little slack can inhibit performance (CHIU; LIAW, 2009) , may be being an organizational weakness , leading to waste that impedes efficiency and competitiveness (NOHRIA; GULATI, 1997; TSENG et al., 2007) . According to Fleck (2021), some mechanisms that encourage slack formation are: having a competitive advantage, securing customer loyalty, generating synergies of antagonistic and complem entary elements, producing efficiency through the skillful coordination of internal and external bonds, and hiring personnel to allow veterans take on new challenges.", "Nonetheless, unfortunately there are also factors that instead of encouraging, preclude s lack formation or generate waste. Some of those factors are the lack of resources that generate competitive advantage (Barney, 1991), isolat ing mechanisms defined as “impediments to the immediate ex post imitative dissipation of entrepreneurial rents” (RUMELT, 1987) such as property rights, excess of payment side in relation to how much is required to keep members in the coalition (CYERT; MARCH, 1992) , inability to productively deal with differences and coordinate internal and external relationships , and integrate new people into the organization (FLECK, forthcoming ).", "Table 4 summarizes these two sides of slack effect : value creation and value destruction.", "Table 4 – The Two Sides of Slack Value Creation Slack in the right dosage … Value Destruction Just slack or slack in inadequate dosag e… adapts the organizational structure to internal and external pressures (HUANG; CHEN, 2010) fosters the formation of coalitions driven by self-interest (CHIU; LIAW, 2009) foster s innovation (CHEN; HSIUNG, 2010) reduces the rate of innovation investments, especially in risky ac tivities (LATHAM; provides conditions for innovation and learning to flourish and it is increasingly critical to organizational survival (LAWSON, 2001) may allow firms not to bother prospecting for optimal environmental strategies, since managers have sufficient slack to all ow them to settle for satisficing options.", "provides firm performance (PENG et al., 2010) by:", "- relaxing resource constrain ts and supporting innovations to release new products - facilitating more effective strategic changes in the face of environmental challenges, - making up for the lack of capital typically found in developing countries by rapidly deploying uncommitted financial resources. has negative impact on firm performance and make the acquisition -performance relationship more negative before and after a jolt . (WAN; YIU, 2009) reduces misalignment between subunit and organizational goals and can be used for when absorbed and is u nable to be productively deployed elsewhere is likely to According to Fleck (2018) organizational integrity contains two complement ary points of view: the organizational social fabric , that is the constitutive aspects of organizational existence and organizational ethical behaviors . The constitutive aspects of organizational existence c onsist of the internal and external bonds that fo rm organizational coalitions (CYERT; MARCH, Organizational ethical elements, on the other hand, are related to behaviors that generate the perception that the organization is a trustworthy actor. In this conceptual line, Mayer , Davis and Schoorman (1995) assert that integrity is one of the characteristics that lead to trust, which frequently appears in the literature.", "Cyert and March (1992) see firms as being coalitions of multiple and conflicting interests and procedures that function under conditions of bounded rationality (SIMON, 1947) . Organizational coalitions are coalitions of individuals, some of which are organized into sub -coalitions, which may be managers, workers, shareholders, suppliers, customers, lawyers, tax collectors or inspectors, regulatory agencies, etc. It is not possible to draw the boundaries of an organizational coalition. In practice, studies focus on a particular temporal or functional \"region\" of members who have individual or group goals. The organization itself deals with potential conflicts of purpose inherent in a coalition of diverse individuals or groups. conflict resolution, therefore can be “a solution for every problem” (TAN; PENG, 2003) contribute to inefficiency (TAN; PENG, can help firms acquire valuable assets faster and at bargain prices during an environmental jolt (WAN; YIU, 2009) affects goal disagreement negatively (BOURGEOIS; SINGH, 1983) insulates organizations from external shocks, fueling adap tive responses to them, and fostering organizational learning (MEYER, 1982) incentives some managers to use it to pursue their own goals or for making acquisitions for empire building and therefore engaging in inappropriate strategies such as excessive diversificati on and influences negatively to performance before and after a jolt. (WAN; YIU, 2009) enable s opportunities exploitation, enhance innovation and risk taking (CHIU; LIAW, 2009) reduces risk taking (BROMILEY, 1991) The bonds between these different individuals and groups can weaken, and may signify the beginning of disintegrative process es, which undermine organizational continued existence. On the other hand, the weakening of the perception of the organization's trustworthiness undermines organizational legitimacy and the ethics conceptual portion of integrity. Ultimately, Fleck (2018, p. 78) states that \"the absence of trust precludes the very essence of organizational existence\". Keeping b oth the constitutive and ethical elements of integrity is a requirement for organizational survival. Along with the other fundamental mechanisms of growth, both the ideal and actual organizational survival states will be reviewed in the next section. 2.1.5. STATE S OF SURVIVAL , STATES OF EXISTENCE AND SUCCESS According to Fleck (2018 , p.84 ), “from an analytical perspective, growth helps the organiza tion meet the requirements for organizational survival.” However, it is t hrough a dual mechanism of strengthening or deterioration of the fundamental drivers of growth that the organization enjoys renewal or suffers from obsolescence, enjoys slack or suffe rs from waste, enjoys integrity, or suffers from disintegration. With t he consequence of strength or deterioration of these mechanisms, it is possible to assess the ideal state of survival of the organization and, ultimately, its actual states of existence . Fleck (2009) demonstrates that w hen an organization manages the three fundamental drivers of growth at full strength, it is found in a self -perpetuating ideal state of survival . On the other hand, when organizations present no magnitude of renewal, slack or integrity, they are facing a self -destructive ideal state. According to Fleck (2018) these states are just transient due to the changing nature of the environment and the organizational components. Nevertheless, combinations of approp riate and insufficient levels of the fundamental growth drivers lead to actual states of organizational existence , as shown in Table 5.", "These states of existence may remain in the organization when the business environment in a certain way encourages, as in the forgiving environment, which will be seen in section 2.2 below . Furthermore, Fleck (2018) asserts that key stakeholders may be willing to support states of existence, helping to keep states of existence permanent , despite condi tions.", "The company's success in the past, however great it may have been, does not guarantee its survival (FLECK, 2009) . Moreover, s uccess does not imply survival and vice versa. Organizational success can be defined as \"the achievement of an objective or purpose, while organizational survival refers to continued operations and the preservation of the company's character\" (FLECK, 2018) . The character of the company is defined by Selznick (1957) , as being a historical product of the organization, which makes responses to internal and external pressures in repetitiv e modes . As organizations become institutions, they become infused with values, producing a distinct identity for the organization. Still according to Selznick (1957) , when studying the organizational character, what matters is this distinctive comp etence, or the inadequacy achieved by the organization in the face of its challenges.", "2.1.6. GROWTH CHALLENGES", "As part of the very essence of organizational existence , uncertainty is an integral part of social interaction and organizational exchanges . According to Penrose (1959) , growth stems from the availability of organizational resources, while uncertainty and risk perception restrict it. Those restrictions are not the only challenge firms may face when pursuing growth. Five c hallenges peculiar to the Table 5 – States of Organizational Existence Renewal (✓) Appropriate (✗) Poor Slack (✓) Positive (✗) Negative or Nil Integrity (✓) Appropriate (✗) Poor State of Existence ✓ ✓ ✓ Sound ✓ ✗ ✓ Lacking Solvency ✓ ✓ ✗ Lacking Integrity ✓ ✗ ✗ Renewal Centered ✗ ✓ ✓ Lacking Renewal ✗ ✓ ✗ Harvesting ✗ ✗ ✓ Integrity Centered ✗ ✗ ✗ Agonizing Source: Fleck (2018 , forthcoming )", "process itself are expected to arise as companies pursue growth (FLECK, 2009) . These challenges are summarized in Table 6.", "The first occurs when c ompanies aiming at promoting growth path s face an organizational challenge called Enterprising. It consists of developing the willingness to expand continuously the company, predisposed to face risks, finding ways of avoiding or managing them and still expand, achieving continuing growth. The second challenge found in processes of organizational growth i s Managing Diversity, which consists of sustain ing the firm’s integrity while increasing its diversity . The third challenge i s the Complexity Management, which consists of managing and solving complex issues that involve many interdependent variables . The fourth challenge is the Managerial Resources Provisioning, which consists of regularly supplying the firm with qualified human resources .", "Challenges often occur over the life of the organization due to the changing nature of the organizational environment (ALDRICH, 1979 ). The environment frequently carries out threats and opportunities requiring organizational survival changes. In order to survive , organizations need to respond adequately to the fifth growth challenge, which is the N avigation . This challenge is relate d to manag ing or dealing with various stakeholders in a changing environment for securing value capture and organizational legitimacy. According to Fleck (2021) , the business environment can be viewed in a framework containing three dimensions that pose distinct challenges , as will be examined in the next section.", "2.2. ENVIRONMENT AL CHALLENGES", "Accordi ng to Fleck ( forthcoming ), three main dimensions make up organizational environments, namely the task/business, the institutional and the society/nature dimensions. Different environment al dimensions pose distinct challenges to the organizational survival, which in turn requires adequate responses, as presented in Table 7. Together, the forces of these dimensions may lead to three ideal states of environment: challenging, forgiving, and inhospitabl e as it will be seen in the next subsection .", "Table 6 – Growth Challenges Growth Challenge Description Navigati ng into the Dynamic Environment The challenge of navigating into the dynamic environment occurs when the organization deals with multiple stakeholders for securing value capture and organizational legitimacy.", "Enterprising Enterprising is the challenge of promoting continued entrepreneurship, stimulating the company's willingness to carry out a value -generating expansion, while avoiding the organization's overexposure to risk. Diversity Management This is the challenge of sustaining organizational integrity of the company in the face of growing conflicts and rivalries. Successful organizational integrity (i) distinguishes heterogeneous and homogeneous organizational elements and bear suitable bonding relations, (ii) promot es homogeneous resources sharing, and (iii) exchang es or combin es other resources. Complexity Management This challenge is related to the resolution and management of complex issues, avoiding risks that affect organizational survival. Managerial Resources Provisioning This challenge refers to equipping the company with the proper human resources needed.", "Source: Fleck (2009)", "Table 7 – Survival Answers to Environment Challenges Environment Dimensions Description Survival Answers to the Dimensions Challenges Task/business The typical features of ‘the games actors play’ Organizational adaptation to environmental uncertainty and active organizational management of resource flows Institutional The institutional ‘rules of the game’ Gaining and sustaining legitimacy Society & Nature The ‘hosts of the game’ Sustainability of the natural environment and society’s well -being", "2.2.1. CHALLENGING STATE OF ENVIRONMENT", "The challenging state does not preclude nor easily enable value creation and value capture , it simply allows them through competition , rewarding efficiency and punishing inefficiency (FLECK, 2009, forthcoming ). This challenging environmental state imposes a fair amount of restrictions and incentives for organizations to efficiently and profitably carry out their business activities. The s trategic management literature generally assumes that business takes place in a competitive and challenging environment. It is a refere nce state, from which market conditions depart.", "The challenging state encourages the development of organizational capabilities appropriate for facing competition and change . This state gives organizations incentives to improve, renew and, therefore, incre ase their chances of survival. Despite being challenging and demanding, it is a state of environment conducive to healthy organizational survival.", "Nevertheless, Fleck (forthcoming ) argues that most situations in actual business es do not f it the concept of the challenging state of environment. To fit such a concept, the environment would need to be provided with well -crafted rules, laws and regulations that reward efficiency and punish inefficiency. This environment would also need to provide agents with the characteristics that constitute markets, that is, have a large number of sellers and buyers, have guaranteed property rights, have basic infrastructure services, easy access to information and physical locations where agents can set up their business. Although in developed count ries it is possible to observe environmental states that are very close to the ideal challenging state, developing countries like Brazil still do not enjoy the establishment of an ideal challenging state. In fact, those who work in the Brazilian environmen t face two other environmental situations: forgiving and inhospitable .", "2.2.2. FORGIVING STATE OF ENVIRONMENT", "According to Fleck (forthcoming ), the Forgiving state is a supportive environment where market and non -market mechanisms hardly restrict the focal organization, allow ing it to create and capture value from its activities. Source: Fleck (forthcoming ) Nevertheless, t his state tends to stimulate a sa tisficing (CYERT; MARCH, 1992) attitude that makes actors unaware of the deterioration processes that can threaten their existence over time, such as inefficiency, orga nizational waste, unproductive entrepreneurship or lack thereof, among others. The Forgiving environment indirectly fuels organizational myopia as the conditions that exist allow the organization to achieve its goals.", "The seemingly encouraging signals tha t a Forgiving environment sends to the organization provide encouragement to continue doing business as usual, rather than examining its weaknesses that need improvement. Moreover, t he Forgiving environment is quite tolerant inefficiency, inferior quality, and infringement of property rights.", "A state of lenience that configures the forgiving environment may drive the organization towards complacency and decline . Although quite friendly to the companies that compete in it, this state undermines healt hy organizational survival . Fleck (forthcoming ) argues that these consequences are in line with the findings of other studies in contexts of business environments with abundant or inexpensive resources. Porter (1990) found that companies can simply rest on advantages of these kinds of environments or exploit their resources inefficiently. Likewise, Datta-Chaudhuri (1990) states that a competitive environment seems necessary to drive an effective organizational structure to be designed by the company.", "Thus, in the Forgiving environment t he organization barely operates under adverse external pressures that might encourage the pursuit of efficiency. Not surprisingly, their inefficiencies and weaknesses tend to be forgiven rather than punished through market and non -market mechanisms. There is plenty of room for lenience, inertia , and contempt f or urgency. Continuous inefficiency, poor quality, waste, rework , and other unproductive outcomes can, over time, lead to outdated solutions and corporate obsolescence. The creation and capture of value are not centered on innovation and urgency, but on th e exploitation (MARCH, 1991) of tried and tested formulas. If innovation is explored (MARCH, 1991) , it usually devel ops in a 'non -urgent' way.", "Rather than an optimizing focus typical of the challenging state, the Forgiving state emphasizes a satisficing mode (CYERT; MARCH, 1992) . Organizations suffering the consequences of the tranquility that characterizes the Forgiving state run the risk of becoming obsolete, wasteful, and uncompetitive. Over time, they engage in corporate political activities to deal with the changing environment and to enjoy an existence that in most cases may not be considered healthy (FLECK, forthcoming ).", "2.2.3. INHOSPITABLE STATE OF ENVIRONMENT", "The inhospitable environment precludes value creat ion and capture value , constituting a very difficult c ontext for the organization to succeed. The inhospitable environment can pose serious restrictions on profitable business activities. Uncertainty is one of the characteristics of this environment that makes the organization's chances of success under the r ules of competition very difficult. In inhospitable states, market and non -market failures abound. Organizational efficiency is hardly rewarded, laws, regulations and property rights are absent, not enforced or even overturned, for example, through institu tional acts or injunctions. Robust states can form out of major economic, social, and political turmoil typical of long periods of war and migration to another state once the turmoil dissipates. Finding ways to survive in harsh environments can provide an organization with resilience, a highly valuable asset for long -term success.", "For dealing with these challenges and healthily survive, organizations must provide the three central conditions (FLECK, 2018) reviewed on section 2.1.4 above : renewal, embracing novelty and promoting organizational renewal; integrity, developing and maintaining organizational integ rity; and slack, producing and productively using organizational slack.", "Another challenge that may affect growth with potential impact on the organizational survival state, can occur specifically in multinational companies. This challenge is related to th e tension that exists between external forces that exert pressure for adaptation in the local environment in the various host countries, called \"local responsiveness\" and the forces exerted to develop standardization toward achiev ing global efficiency, cal led “global integration .” The combination of those forces gives rise to the Integration/Responsiveness framework, which will be reviewed in the next section.", "2.3. INTEGRATION -RESPONSIVENESS FRAMEWORK", "The I/R framework (BARTLETT; GOSHAL, 1989) is formed by the consequences of global integration forces and local responsiveness in the context of multinational companies. Global integration means the interconnection of the activities of the multinational company among the various countries where it operates, where it is possible to identify the strengths of the large company and seek to achieve grea ter synergy effects and interdependencies among the operating companies around the world . These interdependencies are called forces for global integration . These forces for global integration are also called industry globalization drivers and they can be g rouped into four categories: market drivers, cost drivers, governmental drivers, competitive drivers (BARTLETT; BEAMISH, 2018; YIP, 1989) .", "At the same time, a multinational company operates under heterogeneou s conditions in several host countries, dealing with different demands from different customers, regulated differently by different regulatory postures and practices , having different markets and distribution structures and different competitors. The ability of the multinational company to exploit the demands and opportunities arising in this context is called forces for local res ponsiveness . Differences in demand and in country conditions summarized in Table 8 are some of the main factors that make local responsiveness necessary.", "Levitt 's (1983) thesis of convergence suggests that cultures in different countries are increasingly similar, making lifestyles and tastes converge around the world , reinforc ing the need of global integration . Also strengthening this approach, multinational companies have global customers spread across different parts of the globe, often requiring the same standard of service. In the same vein, international sales and distribution channels have coincident presence in several locations of their same suppliers or users. All these aspects strengthen the need for global integration of multinational companies. The efficiency of global sourcing and difference in costs and production factors inter -countries lead to concentration of supply and production activities. Liberal polici es and g lobal competitors likewise drive globalization. International networks in production and trade increase the interdependence of countries and markets , arising a global and standardized presence of multinationals. Finally, large multinational compani es offering the same products and brands all over the Table 8 – Major Forces for Global Integration and Local Responsiveness Forces Components of Global and Local Forces For Global Integration • Market drivers Homogeneous customer needs in different countries create opportunity or need to sell standardized products, making it possible to transfer and centralize some marketing and operations activities.", "• Cost drivers There are varying incentives for standardization from a cost perspective. The greater the economies of scale and scope, and the more advanced the experience curve, the more incentives there are for a company or an industry to go global.", "• Governmental driv ers Product standardization requires regulation that requires technical standards that coincide across countries. Also, drivers for globalization are liberal trade regulation, low tariffs, and no import barriers.", "• Competitive drives Globally coordinated s trategies, including responses to threats in one market with reactions in other markets, are only viable when the operation is global and managed through out operating units interdependently spread across the world.", "For Local Responsiveness • Differences in demand Differences in demand due to profound distinctness in culture, income levels, environmental conditions, and government protectionisms leading to different, reducing or zero demand of goods or services.", "• Differences in country conditions Labor costs, skill levels, number of potential suppliers may require adaptation of production processes to turn it viable and optimized. Different employee attitudes rooted in local cultures can make certain leadership styles more or less effect ive in different countries.", "Source: Bartlett and Goshal (1989) world contribute to the convergence of customer tastes and demands, forming a virtuous circle for the globalization process of multinational companies. Local responsiveness is motivated by aspects rela ted to demand, where or if local culture has not given way to global convergence , opposing Levitt’s thesis (DE MOOIJ, 200 0; HUNTINGTON, 1993) . Moreover, local responsiveness is claimed when income level is considerable different from the global average, when there are environmental challenges such as climate and topology issues or when the government acts in a nationalist and protectionist way. Finally, local labor and supplier -related aspects may require adaptation of manufacturing processes to enable and optimize production efficiency and may require different styles of leadership at local units . The forces of global integration and local responsiveness can be viewed in two separate dimensions forming four MNE’s strategic orientation s, as it can be seen on Figure 4.", "According to this framework, the International strategy is one in which the company does not adapt to the host country and foreign activities are also not integrated by the company. This strategy consists of capitalizing on the parent company's knowledge, products, or processes in foreign markets . Subsidiaries work as remote outposts, offering short -term incremental sales and profits to the parent company.", "The Global strategy is one where the global strengths for integration are strong, while the strengths of local responsiveness are rathe r low. Generally, the dominant state of mind in this strategy is the ethnocentric (PERLMUTTER, 1969) , which occurs when the home country is considered superior, the most relevant resources are concentrated in the headqua rter, key positions of the subsidiary Figure 4 – The Integration -Responsiveness Matrix Forces for Global Integration High Global Organization Transnational Organization Low International Organization Multinational Organization Low High Forces for Local Responsiveness Source: Bartlett and Goshal (1989) organization are occupied by expatriates from the country of origin and there is a strong dependence on the resources of the head office, where decisions are highly concentrated . This strategy seeks global efficiency, through economies of scale, where worldwide demand is met through standardized products, which are produced rationally in a certain concentration of production plants. Information and product flows are unidirectional , follow ing a centralized hub model. The multinational strategy emphasizes local responsiveness forces, focusing primarily on national differences to achieve the company's goals. Many of its characteristics are the reverse of the global organization. Products, processes, strategies and even info rmation systems are flexibly modified in the host country's operations to adapt to local needs, including compliance with government regulations. Adaptation to local markets is facilitated by local production and R&D. While subsidiar ies are responsible for identifying and filling local needs, the parent company provides the necessary resources to meet those needs. Subsidiaries are independent of the headquarters and are not linked to other subsidiaries of the parent company in other countries, forming a decentralized federation model with pol ycentric state of mind (PERLMUTTER, 1969) , where i t starts from the premise that the cultures of host countries are strongly different, and therefore there is a need for adaptation. Finally, the transnational strategy is one that tries to respond simultaneously to high global forces and local respo nsiveness. In industries where both forces are indeed relevant, transnational organizations derive the benefits of combining the characteri stics of both global and multinational organizations. Key activities and resources are neither centralized in the headquarters nor fully decentralized to each country. Instead, resources and activities are geographically dispersed in a specialized way, lea ding to economies of scale and flexibility. There is a combination of a certain level of adaptation of the products to local needs with cross -border production processes that are still concentrated, such as manufacturing specific components in single locat ions. Flows are reciprocal and horizontal, as large flows of products, people, capital, and knowledge among subsidiaries are a feature of this strategy , emphasizing interdependencies and aims for a collaborative approach, characterizing a geocentric state of mind (PERLMUTTER, 1969) . Subsidiaries play the role of centers of excellence and innovation takes place in multiple location s, subsequently being spread worldwide. It is an expensive strategy, generally recommended to be applied in contexts of complex environments with equally high forces of integration and responsiveness.", "3 RESEARCH METHODOLOGY", "3.1. RESEARCH QUESTION AND SCOPE", "Simon (1967) argues tha t business school s can be extremely productive and challenged by researchers who understand and can explo it the advantages of having access to the “real world” as a generator of fundamental research questions. For starting up, t his work follow ed the tenet that “an important first element in the practice of science is ‘establishing the phenomenon’” (VAN DE VEN, 2007) . Phenomena can be defined as regularities that are unexpected, that challenge existing knowledge and that are relevant to scientific discourse (VON KROGH; ROSSI -LAMASTRA; HAEFLIGER, 2012). A phenomenon may be perceived as a representatio n of an “unsatisfying circumstance, a promising opportunity, a breakdown or anomaly in expected arrangements, or simply a topic of interest” (VAN DE VEN, 2016) .", "The phenomenon in focus in this research can be perceived t hrough all those means of representation. The challenges of organizational growth in a dynamic external environment can be view ed as a simple topic of interest. The challenges of organizational growth in a dynamic environment can be perceived as an unsatis factory circumstance because, ultimately, the consequence of such challenges is related to the issue of organizational failure or self -destruction (FLECK, 2009, 2018, forthcoming ). This phenomenon can be a promising opportunity of making management better equipped with the necessary knowledge for leading organizations to the state of success and self -perpetuation (FLECK, 2009, 2018, forthcoming ). Finally, this phenomenon can be seen as a breakdown or anomaly of normal conditions of management in competitive environment s, providing reflections on how to face growth c hallenges at times when the business environment is forgiving (FLECK, 2009, 2018, forthcoming ) and times when the business the environment is inhospitable (FLECK, 2009, 2011, forthcoming ).", "In the Introduction of this work, it was stated that this research aims to clarify the growth challenges that management faces in a dynamic and challenging business environment.

The basic idea of the interview was to let interviewees talk freely about their history, how they arr ived at the focal company, how their career developed, what it was like to work there and everything that happened while they worked there . The few interventions that the interviewer made had as objective s clarifying, reflecting, or requesting further deta ils on some point made by the interview ee.", "The interviews had long durations, in average more than one hour, some interviews longed three hours and a few lasted just thirty minutes. Commonly , the duration of the interviews was limited by the interviewee’s agenda. Three subjects offered the opportunity of a second interview for concluding or to complement their reports.", "In the first phase of consultations, seven interviews were made, then they were fully transcribed, coded and analyzed. The purpose at that time was to find out the main challenges faced by managers of the oil products market, given that many multinational companies left the country, as described in the introduction of this work.", "The second phase of interviews aimed at investigating how Shell Bra sil dealt with the challenges it faced along its recent history. Eventually, twenty -five in-depth interviews with average duration of one to two hours each were made , totaling over thirty -five hours of recorded and transcribed interviews. The interviewees were expected to be experienced business executives, with medium to high seniority, who had worked at Shell or, at the very least, had considerable skills and experience in the industry. They were asked to tell the history of their careers in the company and/or in the ir experience in the oil products market, highlighting , whenever possible, the challenges both they and the company experienced. Table 11 shows the distribution of interviewees' profiles.3", "3 Some executives worked at Shell Brasil or at Royal Dutch Shell and currently are working elsewhere. This is the reason why the total exceeds the total number of interviews made. Table 10 – Interview Design I.

METHODS OF DATA ANALYSIS", "3.4.1. FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENTS OF DATA ANALYSIS", "Analyzing process data allows the development of theories consisting of explanations in terms of events that generate an outcome (LANGLEY, 1999) . Process data consist of events, activities, and choices over time and their analyses require “a means of conceptualizing events and of detecting patterns among them” (LANGLEY, 1999, p. 692) . Patterns can be linear sequences of phases occurred overtime leading to a given result.", "Process d ata analysis involves word manipulation, narrative strategies , grounded theory, quantification, matrices, and graphic forms. According to (LANGLEY, 1999) , graphic forms have several advantages over narrative approaches, as they allow the presentation of large amounts of information in relatively little space and can be useful tools for the development and verification of theoretical ideas. Graphical visual representations are particularly attractive for analyzing process data because they allow the simul taneous representation of many dimensions and can be easily used to show precedence, parallel processes, and the passage of time.", "Different forms of process mapping have been used for a long time by organizations to plan, understand and correct their own w ork processes and according to Langley (1999) , this example should be followed in organizational research. Graphics became the raw material for developing a more comprehensive process model and will be used for the an alysis in focus . Some of the tenets of oral history will be used in order to expand the possibilities of interpretation of the past (ALBERTI, 2008) . Oral history is a methodology for researching and constituting sources for the study of contemporary history, emerged in the mid -twentieth century, after the invention of the tape recorder. It consists of condu cting recorded interviews with individuals who have participated in, or have witnessed, events and past and present conjunctures. Such interviews are made with specific objectives, recorded in audio or video, and produced in the context of research project s, which determine how many and which people to interview, what and how to ask, and what fate will be given to the material produced.", "Oral history enables testimony and access to “histories within the history”, thus widening interpretation of the past. I n the 1960’s it was used for researching the life history of the minorities. Confronting with the positivist history of the XIX century, the oral history became the anti -history, the history of the local and the community, as opposed to the history of the nation. It advanced with the transformation of the human science, which no longer thinks in terms of a single national history or identity, to recognize the existence of multiple histories, memories, and identities in a society.", "This notion is especially d eveloped in German texts, which receives the name of history of experience (Erfahrungsgeschichte) and it comes out in association with the concept of perspective of change (Perspektivenwechsel). In general terms this association means to understand how peo ple and groups of people experienced the past , turning it possible to question generalized interpretations of certain events and contexts.", "3.4.2. PROCEDURES OF ANALYSIS", "After recording the interviews and transcribing, the text documents with transcriptions were imported to the QDA software, and a process of coding took place in three stages. In the f irst stage , coding categories were derived from the data. The devised categories aimed at being part of a coherent set created for providing a well -structured analytic al framework to pursue the analysis. Initially the categories were just descriptive, as they were constructed inductively, thereafter a more hierarchical approach to the categorization of the data were developed. That way, some category codes were develope d and used to indicate emerging analytical linkages between the data (KING, 2004) .", "The second stage of coding was produced considering the conceptual framework , which “lays out the key factors, constructs, or variables, and presumes re lationships among them” (MILES; HUBERMAN, 1994) . Table 12 lists the categories of codes created based on the conceptual framework .", "1 Data associations with theoretical elements 1.1 Elements of the I -R Model 1.1.1 Integrative Elements 1.1.2 Local Responsive ness Elements 1.2 Concepts Fleck's Theory", "1.2.1 Survival", "1.2.2 Growth Drivers", "1.2.2.1 Renewal", "1.2.2.3 Integrity 1.2.3 Growth Challenges 1.2.3.1 Enterprising 1.2.3.2 Navigating into the Dynamic Environment 1.2.3.2.1 Challenge able Environment 1.2.3.2. 2 Forgiving Environment 1.2.3.2. 3 Inhospitable Environment 1.2.3.3 Diversity Management 1.2.3.4 Managerial Resources Provisioning 1.2.3.5 Complexity Management", "The third stage was a refinement of the code structure, which consisted of revising in the way that King (2004) , id est: (i) insertion of a new code into the hierarchy as the result of a relevant issue being identified through data collection or inclusion of conceptual elements for which there is no existing code; (ii) deletion of a code from the hierarchy if it is not needed; (iii) changing the scope of a code, that is altering its level within the hier archy; (iv) reclassifying a code to a different category.", "Having passed through these three stages of coding, the final structure reproduced on the Appendix B was elaborated and used for performing the analys es that are on section 4. The excerpts from the interviews that illustrated the analysis presented on chapter 4 were kept in the original language of the interview, most of the times the Portuguese language, in order to safeguard the literal meaning of the message conveyed by the interviewees. Table 12 – Second Stage Coding", "3.5. LIMITATIONS AND RESERVATIONS", "Research conducted through the use of oral history methodology is expensive, as it is necessary to spend a large amount of resources with the interview preparation, contact with the interviewees, record the interviews, transcribe them, review, and analyze. As usually many interviews are made, the amount of time and money spent are important. The richness of an oral history study has the potential of comp ensating its costs because it enables to understand how people or groups of people had and drawn on experience, including learning and strategic decisions. However, limited financial resources were used for developing this research.", "The researcher worked for more than twenty years in the focal company. However, as the interviewer , the researcher was able to listen sympathetically to his interviewees without taking on an advisory role, encouraging participants to elaborate their answer s without expressing approval, disapproval, judgment, or partiality, kept control of the questions, letting the conversation develop naturally and managing the interview respecting the principle of the participant as an expert. In addition, several seconda ry data were used to triangulate the analysis and results.", "4 ANALYSIS", "4.1. CONTEXT OVERVIEW", "Upon entering Brazil, Shell was only five years old, although its origins began a little earlier. Five years were accounted just from when two companies, one British and the other Dutch, came together to create the Royal Dutch Shell in 1907. Shell's origins go back a little earlier in 1890 , when the Royal Dutch Petroleum Company was founded, and 1897 when The \"Shell\" Transpor t and Trading Company , a British organization, went into operation. The joining of forces and the association between these companies and the consequent birth of Royal Dutch Shell is attributed to competition with Standard Oil, currently ExxonMobil Corpora tion (GOEY, 2002) .", "Until the current days these companies compete in the global market. The British -Dutch oil and gas company operates in Upstream, Midstream, Downstream businesses and in Integrated Gas. Integrated Gas includes manufacturing and distribution of Liquefying Natural Gas (LNG), gas -to-liquids products, new energies such as biofuels, hydrogen, wind, and solar power. With presence in more than 70 countries, employing more than 82,000 people, the company production amounted $ 3,666 kboe/d, 51% gas and 49% liquids, its income was $23.9 billion in 2018, being the 1st in the ranking of the world’s top non-financial MNEs, measured by foreign assets (UNCTAD, 2019) and the 5th largest global company in revenues (FORTUNE GLOBAL 500, 2019) .", "ExxonMobil is one of the largest companies in the world, the tenth in market value in 2018, with US$ 344,1 billion (STATISTA, 2019) , the ninth in the glo bal 500 list of largest companies in revenues (FORTUNE GLOBAL 500, 2019) .", "Figure 3 presented earlier shows that in the last 4 decades and especially from the mid 2010s, both Royal Dutch Shell and ExxonMobil have experimented a down trend pressure , considering growth measured by the ratio between revenues and the global Gross Domestic Product (GDP). This performance in the most recent history of both companies has certainly put pressure on the management of their subsidiaries around the world, especially with the aim o f achieving organizational growth and financial return.", "Both companies promoted a downsizing of their assets around the world. As seen before , ExxonMobil's downstream businesses exited the country, while Shell resists with an organizational configuration d ifferent from its entire history in Brazil. There is no one in Brazil that could be interviewed for reporting the ExxonMobil oral history in the level of details needed for this theoretical analysis. Nevertheless, the Shell's recent history has been told i n great detail. Until then, no one had reported this history. Subsequently, w ith data collected about the history of the British -Dutch company’s downstream operation in Brazil , its strategic and organizational movements were analyzed through the lens of growth theory and other theoretical frameworks.", "This study organized the history of Shell and its oil products businesses in Brazil in such a way that the milestones of these periods were the beginning of a higher level of government intervention in the mar ket that began in the 1930s , and the deregulation process that began in the 1990s. The remarkable role of the government in the sector, determined the analysis of history in these three parts. In the first part there was more market freedom, in the second part of the government the interventionist process is born, matures and ends. In the last part, there is a confusing and very consequential process of deregulation of the sector. Figure 7 shows the context provided by government activi ties, economy, the oil sector, and competition summariz ing this history .", "The first phase is characterized by the entry of oil MNEs in the beginning of the 20th century until the inauguration of a series of government intervention in the industry with the decree 19,717 signed in 1931, which made mandatory the mixture of anhydrous alcohol to imported gasoline. Subsequently, several governmental and private autarchies were created in order to promote nationalization campaigns and state interventions in the oil products market. These events culminated in the establishment of the state oil monopoly, the establishment of prices and margins by the government agency, and the nationalization of companies in the sector.", "This phase ends with the inverse movement, where the oil market was deregulated . In 1997, the end of the oil monopoly and price controls in the sector were determined. This event marks the beginning of the third and final phase of this history, characterized by a gradual alleviation of the oil market from the state control. The deregulation process , however, promote d the emergence of unfair competition with the rise of numerous oil distribution small companies, many of them making use of tax e vasion and product adulteration practices. Today, more than 20 years after this market liberalization movement, unfair competition still occurs . Over time, a series of actions organized by the government and market agents were carried on combatting the ev asion and adulteration of fuels , as perceived by the interviewees ’ reported below: era um mercado muito ruim sob o ponto de vista de resultado, porque margens eram muito próximas a zero ou senão negativas, em função daquela bagunça que se vivia de sonegaçã o, liminares, adulteração. O mercado começa a mudar e passou a ser um mercado relativamente sadio dois, três anos depois. [INT2] E hoje eu diria que em noventa oito por cento [da competição injusta] está resolvido. Tem alguma coisinha? Deve ter. Mas eu acho que hoje tem mais é adulteração, mas também estão em cima da adulteração Unfortunately , some outlaw practices that exist today are very sophisticated or are promoted by agents whose organizat ions are large and have been inhibited by crime control and enforcement agencies (FUNDAÇÃO GETULIO VARGAS, 2021) . In any case, this is a new phase in the context of the history of the oil products secto r in Brazil, in which the market and Shell are experimenting.", "The main facts and events of the historical context of oil products sector in Brazil from start to end of the timespan , organized by each of these three phases are reported in detail as from section 4.1.1 below . Subsequently , Shell's trajectory is analyzed under both the historical point of view and the theoretical lenses explored in chapter 2 above .", "Figure 7 – Timeline of Shell and the Oil Sector in Brazil", "4.1.1. PHASE 1 CONTEXT (1912 -1931) – DESPITE THE", "CHALLENGES, FREE TO GROW At the beginning of the 20th century, Brazil was still experiencing the effects of a strong economic crisis called Encilhamento, originated at the end of the previous century. At that time, the Brazilian government intended to stimulate industrialization b y offering credit and authorizing the printing of paper money to make loans aimed at industrial entrepreneurs. There was an excessive facilitation for the taking of credit and ghost companies appeared, taking the credit offered and never paid. There was al so an increase in financial speculation through the sale by the Stock Exchange of shares of financially fragile companies that obtained credit without offering collateral. As a result, the inflation rose, the exchange rate depreciated and the objective of encouraging the industry was not achieved. To remedy the crisis, the Brazilian government increased its external debt and resorted to a financial agreement with England called funding loan. The international situation was characterized by tensions and conf licts that culminated in the first great war (FAUSTO, 2006) .", "The Brazilian oil products market emerged with the beginning of industrialization and more pronouncedly with the outset of a strong demand for automobiles in the country at the beginning of the 20th century. Until 1907, there were around 600 imported automobil es circulating in Brazil , between 1908 and 1913, another 9,915 units were brought in from abroad (MELO, 2008) . To fill the fuel tanks of automobiles at that time, there was a need of importing gasoline. Decree 9,335 /1912 allowed S tandard Oil Company of Brazil to sell gasoline, kerosene, and lubricants throughout the Brazilian territory. With just over a thousand kilometers of roads, the country had an enormous potential for growth in road construction for its industrial sprint. Sta ndard Oil, which in the future would become Esso, installed its office in the city center of São Paulo, having incorporated the Empre za Industrial de Petróleo, which since 1897 ha d supplied kerosene for lighting streets, shops, and houses.", "In 1912, Rio de Janeiro was the capital of the Republic with 952 thousand inhabitants and the city of São Paulo had 400 thousand. Throughout the year, 2,400 motor vehicles hit the streets, a record for the time, although it corresponds to the number of vehicles that enter into circulation every day in Brazil today (SINDICOM, 2010) . The brands Motano and Brindilla , respectively gasoline and kerosene, arrived in cans through the port of S antos and were sold by Standard Oil in wooden boxes. The products were stored in a 20,000 square meter warehouse in a neighborhood in São Paulo and were distributed to warehouses and wholesalers in various parts of Brazil. Gradually, from a small office in downtown São Paulo, Standard Oil set up a network with 17 branches, in various states, and added industrial oils and greases to its product portfolio. In the following year s other multinationals entered in the Brazilian market. Shell entered the country in 1913 , according with decree 10,168 . At the time, t he company was called Anglo -Mexican Petroleum Products Co. LTD and it started its activities in an office with six employees in the city center of Rio de Janeiro. Its operations consisted of supplying fuel oil , Aurora kerosene and Energina gasoline , which arrived in boxed cans at the port of Rio, transported by ordinary freighters. The products were stored in a warehouse built on Ilha do Governador, where, in May 1914, the company installed its first fuel oil tanks. The fuel oil distributed by the company came from Mexico and was transferred from tankers through animals and later through floating wooden structures. The oil was the alternative for industry , rail, and sea transport in the face of the shortage of coal, caused by the First World War. To serve the sector, Anglo -Mexican built storage tanks in Santos and Recife. The company's logistics include d donkeys and horse -drawn vehicles. To load fuel on ships bound for other states, Anglo -Mexican rented wagons pulled by animals and motor vehicles, which took kerosene to the nearest port and pier.", "Texaco arrived in Brazil in the middle of the first world war in 1915 . The Texas Company South American, as it was called, was authorized to operate in the country by Decree 11.702, signed by president Venceslau Brás. Texaco started to sell kerosene and gasoline from its headquarters i n downtown Rio de Janeiro, while it also started to supply in other states. The illuminating kerosene business was the flagship in the first year of the company's activities, having added 100 thousand of the 118 thousand tons of derivatives sold by the distributor in the country.", "The first gas station in Brazil started operating in 1919 in the city of Santos, being considered the first of its kind in South America. The property was owned by Antônio Duarte Moreira, who obtained a concession from the Municipality so that could supply its fleet of taxis. In 1920 the routine of handling gasoline cans, drums and funnels was over, as the innovation of pumps arrived in Brazil, foreshadowing the construction of a network of gas stations in the country. During the years that this phase of history summarized here consists of, the Brazilian political environment was marked by high corruption and several military uprisings. At that time, the world was at peace, but suffering the political, economic, and social consequences of the great war. Coffee, which accounted for more than half of Brazilian exports, was falling, Brazilian t rade with the outside decreased a lot, mainly with Europe.", "The Brazilian industry ended up growing in this period, starting to produce products such as steel and cement, which were imported from countries that suffered from the great war. Standard Oil inst alled its first mechanical car supply system in 1921, at Praça XV, in downtown Rio (SINDICOM, 2010) . In the following year hand -cranked gas stations appear on streets, garages in capitals and inland cities, as well as along highways. On July 7, 1922, President Epitácio Pessoa authorized the installation of the Atlantic Refining Company of Brazil, the fourth distributor to settle in the country. At that year Atlantic’s pr oducts had already been consumed in the Brazilian market for seven years, distributed by a sales representative. The company has had a sales office in Brazil since August 1921, committed to conquering spaces in Rio, São Paulo, and other states. The brand's success was the “Kerosene Sol ”. The Brazilian subsidiary advised the head office against sales efforts of automotive fuel. The company revised its market misappropriation in time and in 1923 started selling bulk gasoline, brought from the United States on its ships.", "Later, the Gulf company arrived and the first commercial flights , increased demand of oil products in the country in 1927. The first planes were filled with fuels and lubricants from Standard Oil and Anglo -Mexican, taken from cans and drums. Betting on the new market, Anglo -Mexican soon created an exclusive aviation sector.", "In the international scenario, the USA, which was the biggest buyer of Brazilian coffee, suffered from the stock market crash in 1929, consequently , the stocks of t he main product of the Brazilian economy were looming. The political scene in the country was in turmoil. Julio Prestes, who had been elected by popular vote, but was overthrown in a coup d'etat in which a military junta handed over power to Getulio Vargas , leader of the so -called revolutionary forces Despite the pol itical turmoil, Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo were some of the urban centers that were experiencing robust growth at that time. The increasingly intense traffic of passenger cars, buses, trucks, and motorcycles leads the government to take measures to organ ize it. In the federal capital, traffic lights appear, traffic signs received with protests by both pedestrians and drivers, who shared the complaint that the news made them lose time on the streets. Other innovations of the time were the double -decker bus es, soon called “Chopp - Duplo”, and the first taximeters, which replaced the charging for run time (SINDICOM, 2010) .", "4.1.2. PHASE 2 CONTEXT (1932 -1990) – GOVERNMENT", "INTERVENTIONS IN THE SECTOR The country started adding anhydrous alcohol (without water) to imported gasoline, in the proportion of up to 5%. The mixture was determined in 1931 by President Getúlio Vargas through Decree 19,717, aiming at adding up foreign exchange savings with the purchase of oil products, as well as taking advantage of surpluses in the national production of sugarcane. For this reason, the MNEs of oil products distribut ion were obligated to purchase alcohol from Brazilian mills. This decre e marked an era of government interventionism in the oil sector. The defense of national wealth, the effort to accelerate the country's development and integrate the Brazilians set the tone for the debates held in the government, in the National Congress a nd in the press.", "In 1933, the Sugar and Alcohol Institute ( Instituto do Açúcar e do Álcool - IAA) was created, through decree 22,789, with the objective of guiding, promoting, and controlling the production of sugar and alcohol and its raw materials throu ghout the national territory. This governmental autarchy was instituted at the request of the mill owners, mainly from the Northeast, then struggling with a violent crisis of overproduction (FGV CPDOC, 2020a) . The Costa Pinto plant, in Piracicaba, was bought by the brothers Pedro Ometto and João Ometto, and the partner Mário Dedini in 1936, the Cosan group was born. In 1934, Ipiranga emerged as the first national oil company in Brazil, although the enterprise was also formed by Argentine and Urugua yan investors. Ipiranga also debuted the refining activity in the country in 1937 . In that year, a supposedly communist revolution in Brazil sparked a coup d’état and the creation of a new constitution, leading to a strong power concentration on the hands of the Brazilian president at that time, closing the parliament, censoring the radio and television media, prohibiting strikes, and establishing government control over labor syndicates (FAUSTO, 2006) .", "The advent of the dictatorial regime in Brazil called Estado Novo in 1937 led to the suppression of political freedom and centralization of power in the hands of the country president, Getúlio Vargas . The government intervened into the economy with several developmenta l and modernizing measures. While keeping Congress and state and municipal legislatures closed, appointing state interveners and harassing opposition members, the new regime launched itself into the induction and control of economic activity, giving strate gic priority to sectors such as energy.", "On November 10, 1937, Getúlio Vargas promulgated a new Constitution, which added to the 1934 Constitution's requirement for federal authorization for the exploitation of mineral deposits that the concession would on ly be granted “to Brazilians, or companies constituted by shareholders Brazilians” (art. 143, §5). It was a nationalist reinforcement of the constitutional provision of 1934 which, establishing for the first time in Brazil the distinction between ownership of the soil and mineral wealth of the subsoil, although did not impose any restriction on the nationality of the shareholders. One important government autarchy created in this context was the National Petroleum Council (CNP), by Decree Law 325, on April 29, 1938 . At that time, the antecedents of the World War II (WW II), were taking place.", "Brazil had a discreet participation on the WW II , being most of the time neutral in the international conflict . The country was living a dictatorial government during this global warfare period , when the government fostered the creation of considerable labor rights and a nationalist industrial policy to substitute imports due to the context of the WW II. Brazil began to suffer from the conflict in 1940, affected by the retraction of international trade. Petroleum products were the first to become scarce on the market , due to reduced exports from producing countries, increased demand, and declining of maritime navigation. As national consu mption depended on imported fuel, the shortage affected the transport and supply of everyday items in various parts of the country.", "The government invested in the creation of several large national companies, such as the Companhia Siderúrgica Nacional (steelworks ), the Companhia Vale do Rio Doce (mining company currently named Vale), the Companhia Hidrelétríca do Vale do São Francisco (Hydro -electric energy ), boosting the nationalism sentiment in the country . Anti-dictatorship manifestations occurred and in 1945 new political parties were allowed to be reopened, increasing the government opposition . Eventually the country’s president was deposed by the military force and new elections took place . In 1945 CNP proposed the entry of foreign capital into oil exploration, production and refining and, in October, through Resolution 1/45, authorized the installation of private refineries with national capital. In 1948, t he “Centro de Estudos e Defesa do Petróleo e da Economia Nacional (C EDPEN) ” or the Petroleum S tudies and Defense Center was a civil entity coordinated by military. The entity sponsored a campaign called \"O Petróleo é Nosso\" (“the oil is ours”) , complaining about the presence of multinationals in the control, refining and trading of petroleum and cl aiming for a state presence in the sector . To some extent, the creation of Petrobras is attributed to the intense debates promoted by CEDPEN (FGV CPDOC, 2020b) .", "In 1952, Shell changed its na me from Shell -Mex Brazil Limited to Shell Brazil Ltda. In the same year, the company inaugurated the Department of Chemical Products in São Paulo, s elling chemical products for industrial use and agricultural defensives (“Shell Brasil Company Site”, 2020) . Later, this business generated one of the biggest reputational crises for the company in Brazil, who was accused of soil contamination and harm to the health of employees of the population residing in the affected area (ALVES; OMETTO; GUIMAR ÃES, 2018) . Petrobras was created by law number 2 ,004 / 1953, which also established the state's oil monopoly and attributions of guidance and supervision of the sector to the National Petroleum Council . The law did not consider the distribution of oil products in the establishment of the state monopoly. Before Petrobras' inauguration, Exxon held 45% of the market and Shell also owned a large share of the market. With the inauguration of Petrobras, a large part of the state -owned companies that were clie nts of the market leaders started to be supplied by the national oil company .", "In 1954 S hell launched the first differentiated fuel in Brazil , a gasolin e Shell with an additive called I.C.A. (Ignition Control Additive). However, the launch was frustrated , with the product being remain ed on the market just for a few months, being withdrawn due to the high cost of importing the additive (“Shell Brasil Company Site”, 2020) .", "Juscelino Kubitschek (JK) govern ed the country between 1956 and 1961 . Its government was marked by the action plan called \"fifty years in five\", aiming at bringing economic and social development to Brazil. The Brazilian capital was constructed and inaugurated in 1960. Many r oads across the country were built, facilitating automotive transport, and vigorously fostering the a utomobile industry. In this period, Furnas, a big government company of generation and transmission of energy in high and extra -high voltage was created , consumer and basic industries were also developed, and many American companies came to Brazi l. Togethe r with economic growth, the JK government was also marked by the incurrence of a high public debt and diversion of public funds (FAUSTO, 2006) . Promo ting a combat of diversion of public funds and corruption, i n 1961 Jânio Quadros was elected the country’s president . At that time, t he Brazilian economy continued to experience large growth rates in the 1960’s , but the external debt and inflation rates were high. Severe measures to contain inflation and reduce external debt were taken, some of them reduced the president popularity and generated military dissatisfaction . Less than seven months later Jânio resigned.", "At that time, there were a high degree of populism and nationalism on the government s.

A new constitution was promulgated in 1967, although in practice, to a considerable extent the autocratic military regime did not follow its rules . Since the late 1970s, the military regime began to establ ish a slow, gradual, and secure transition to democracy.", "In 1971, Companhia de Petróleo do Amazonas (COPAM ), a family company in the refining industry was nationalized by the military government (“Petrobras Company Site”, 2020) . In the same year, two important companies in the oil sector were founded: BR Distribuidora (currently Vibra Energia) , the Petrobras ’ oil products business arm, and Petróleo Sabbá, a joint venture formed between Shell and IB Sabbá, whose shareholder was the former COPAM entrepreneur. With this JV, Shell r eached the mark of around 3,000 service stations being operated in Brazil (“Shell Brasil Company Site”, 2020) . The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC ) was very representative in the global oil market and in the 1970s it had decrea sed the supply of the product since its creation . As a result , a series of conflicts occurred involving the Arab countri es that are members of this organization. Conflicts included the 1967 Six -Day War and the 1973 Yom Kippur War . In March 1974, the price of oil rose by 400%, causing a major impact in the United States, Europe and destabilizing the economy around the world (YERGIN, 1992) .", "This moment coincides w ith the end of the economic miracle that took place during the military dictatorship in Brazil , which was characterized with high GDP growth rates in the country.

In 1988 a new constitution was enacted, guaranteeing a series of social and labor benefits, in addition to promoting the return of democracy in the country. In 1989, after so many years of military dictatorship, the Brazilian population was able to direc tly elect its president (FAUSTO, 2006) .", "The d iscussions on the creation of the new text of the constitution were heated. There were political forces favorable to the nationalization of the oil sector. In the same year when Shell opened the first convenience store in Brazil, the company strongly pronounced in the media claiming that u nder no circumstances the company would agree to become a minority shareholder of a public company, threatening to exit the business of oil products from the country.

The role of the Sindicom board was to deal with regulatory bodies, which are extremely invasive in relation to the operations of distributors. Since its creation, the command of the CNP was almost always occupied by army generals. Our life was to sit Figure 8 – Heated discussions on the business environment at the table with members of the council, a lmost always colonels, and negotiate prices, margins, product quotas and authorizations to open filling stations and terminals. The government determined the value of the fuel at the refinery, fixed the profit margins, said for how much the product should be sold to the consumer and even dictated the speed of opening of gas stations. Even the supply of fuel to an industry had to be communicated to the council. All this only began to change in the 1990s, with the beginning of the problematic liberalization p rocess and the creation of the DNC. (SINDICOM, 2010) This phase 2 in the history of the oil products market in Brazil, especially from the end of the WWII until the end of the 20th century, was also marked by the wide adoption and diffusion of communication technologies, originating from the telegraph and telephone, and leading to the personal computer, satellite communications and early versions of the World Wide Web. An important wave of globalization was taking place at this phase .", "4.1.3. PHASE 3 CONTEXT (1990 -CURRENT DAYS) – ECONOMIC", "ORDER, MARKET DISORDER After 21 years of military dictatorship, the Brazilian citizens went to the polls and elected Fernando Collor de Mello as president of the country. One day after taking office, the president extinguished the National Petroleum Council (CNP) and created the National Fuel Department (DNC), by Decre e 99,180 . According to Pinto Junior et al. (2016 , p. 120 ), this measure “changed the relationship between the State and the main agent of the industry, Petrobras, […] and mad e it possible to implement changes in the administration of prices of oil products to the final consumer. ” The new government created a new currency and adopted a series of polemical measures in the economy such as extinction of public agencies and minist ries, reducing public expenses, confiscation of bank deposits for a period of eighteen months aiming to reduce the amount of currency in circulation, change in the calculation of monetary correction, dismissal of public employees, freezing of prices and sa laries, beginning of privatization of state -owned companies. Even though with controversial actions and attitudes, the Collor government represented a milestone in opening the country to the global market, through measures of breaking customs barriers and reducing import tax rates. This led to the entry of imported products at lower prices and new brands in the national market , resulting in losses to companies operating in the country due to the increasing competition. The international competi tion represented a microeconomic shock because previous ly the paternalism and forgiving posture adopted by the Brazilian government were prevalent . This forced companies to modernize themselves so as not to completely lose their share of market. On April 12, 1990, Law 8,031 was enacted , creat ing the National Privatization Program ( Programa Nacional de Desestatização ). Among other measures, the law reordered the State's strategic position in the economy, transferring activities unduly exploited by the publi c sector to the private sector . At this time, global forces influenced Shell's international management, which initiated a process of strategic changes that had an impact in Brazil. One example was the standardization of global brands and the reduction of lubricant stock keeping units.", "Hyperinflation was still a considerable challenge in Brazil . Despite the stabilization of prices and modernization of the industrial park, once again, the attempt s to contain the chronicle inflation were unsuccessful. The imp lemented economic plans resulted in a strong recession, unemployment, and great dissatisfaction on the part of the population. There were several allegations of corruption in the federal government , leading to the establishment of the CPI (Parliamentary Commission of Inquiry) and eventually to the impeachment of President Collor in 1992. That year, Itamar Franco, the vice president of the republic , assumed the presidency of the country.", "In 1993, Ordinance 362 of the Ministry of Mines and Energy (MME) was promulgated, allowing the participation hundreds of agents in the fuel reseller market, without an exclusive contract with any distributor, this new agent was called “white flag” gas stat ion or dealer. The Brazilian market had its fuel industry characterized by exclusive contracts between distributors and reseller stations, that is, each reseller obligatorily established an exclusivity contract with a distributor and only purchased fuel fr om that distributor. The change in this structure was, without a doubt, an important factor in the establishment of a new price formation dynamic, governed by market forces.", "However, with the emergence of the white flag dealer and small distributors in th e market, several irregular practices were facilitated, such as fuel adulteration, gasoline smuggling, non -compliance with exclusivity contracts and tax evasion. These practices cause d distortions in the functioning of the market, made competition unfeasib le, harm ed consumer s and taxpayer s, reduce d state and union tax revenues, encourage d corruption and organized crime. An inhospitable business environment was established.", "Also in 1993, Ipiranga acquire d Atlantic for US$ 256 million , the Brazilian subsidia ry of the American ARCO, representing until that date the most important exit from the business of an MNE in the oil distribution sector in Brazil. In 1994, the government launched a monetary stabilization plan to combat inflation, which had reached 2,477% in the previous year . At th at time, reports recorded in the interviews in this research indicate that Shell’s operating income was negative while the financial income was extraordinarily high . In other words, Shell had a business model based on financial profit, coming from overnight investments at exorbitant rates, while the operation was inefficient. Reports from interviewees representing the subsidiary of ExxonMobil in Brazil indicate that the business model of the American competitor to Shell had the s ame characteristic at the time.", "With the monetary stabilization plan – the “Plano Real ” – the operational inefficienc ies of the companies were exposed. Downsizing, asset sales , cost reduction, many programs were developed aiming at adapting the organization for the new business and economic scenarios, some initiatives were actually put into practice, but organizational resistance and institutional rigidity meant that the changes promoted were not enough to bring back good conditions for healthy survival to the organization.", "In addition, reports indicate that in the years from the nineties to nineties and nineties, Shell Brasil made a lot of investment, two hundred million dollars a year, a lot of bad investments from the parent company's point of view. There was also a lot of credit loss with resellers who did not pay bad debts. In 1997, t he law 9,478 created the National Petroleum Agency (ANP) and the National Energy Policy Council (CNPE) , admitted the regime of free competition in the exploration and production of oil. The liberalization of the oil products market took place more effectively with the law, having been concluded on December 31, 2001. Readjustments in fuel prices started to be managed exclusively by each economic agent, who establish ed their sales prices and commercialization margins in a free competition scenario. In the exploration and production activity, t he Union monopoly was maintained, meaning that the Brazilian federal government decide s whether to open tenders or not, whether to explore oilfields, and choose the concession model.", "In 1997, the Argentine an company YPF entered Brazil and the following year was acquired by the Spanish company Repsol, forming Repsol YPF Brasil. In 1998 Companhia São Paulo Distribuidora, a local company founded in 1961, sold its network with 1 ,100 stations, 120 of which belonge d to the company, to the Italian company Agip.", "In 1999, Shell Brasil was not doing very well in the evaluation of the headquarters, with several structural challenges, this caused the board to be changed, many people left at that time. Shell Brasil is a ve ry large company, it did well during the entire period before, but two years with losses, that needed an answer, said an interviewee.", "The economy in Brazil slowed down in 2001. Between July of that year and February 2002, Brazil faced a severe energy supp ly crisis that restrained the growth of the economy. The situation was greatly aggravated in 2002 by a strong crisis of confidence result ed from the elections . Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva was elected the presiden t of the Republic of Brazil , surrounding subse quent uncertainties about the intentions of the new government. There was an outflow of capital and a consequent overshooting of the exchange rate. Inflation increased substantially and only returned to its target years later. At that time, Shell was goin g through a process of downsizing, cost reduction and global reorganization, which led to a reduction in the decision - making power of Shell Brasil's local management. One quarter of Shell Brasil workforce was laid off and m ore than 500 service stations loc ated in the mid -west and south regions of the country were sold to the Italian MNE Agip. Several other gas stations were depleted . Exiting the country was considered and the sale of the company was negotiated , but without success. Shell Brasil was still trying to fit its business to the new environment. In 2002, there was a recovery of the Brazilian GDP growth and another growth cycle returned to the country economy . Some of the solutions proposed by the workgroups formed to deal with the challenges of that time was not permitted by the government. The crisis that Shell ’s high command faced in relation to the overvalued accounting of its global reserves in 2004 reinforced the company's need for downsizing not only i n Brazil but also in other locations where its operations lacked more efficiency and financial return around the world . In addition to a major change in its global Board of Directors, Shell changed its corporate governance, and two considerable strategic decisions were made . The first decision can be represented by the motto \"more upstream, profitable downstream\", from which the company focused its corporate strategy on the exploration and production business and sought greater efficiency in oil products . The second strategic decision , whose slogan was \"From West to East\", focused investments, especially downstream businesses investments , toward the Asian market . As a result of those dec isions, i t was determined that the Shell’s global presence should be reduced from 137 countries to 90. The two regions most affected were Africa and Latin America. In Africa, almost all operations were sold, while in Latin America, Shell divested its asset s in Paraguay, Uruguay, Colombia, Jamaica, Peru, Chile, Ecuador, among other countries.", "In 2007 Ipiranga was sold to Petrobras, Ultra and Braskem for US$ 4 billion. With the sale, Ultra took over Ipiranga's fuel distribution network in the South and South east regions, as well as the Ipiranga brand, the second largest fuel distribution company in Brazil, with 15% market share. Petrobras took over Ipiranga's distribution network in the North, Northeast and Midwest and gradually changed the brand of the acqui red assets for the BR Distribuidora brand. Braskem, in turn, obtained 60% of the assets of the Ipiranga Group in the petrochemical sector and reinforced its controlling position in Copesul , another Chemical company . Petrobras took 40% of the activities of the Ipiranga Group in the petrochemical sector.", "In 2008, Ultra acquired Texaco's fuel distribution in Brazil , a network with 1,986 service stations in the country for US$ 1.6 billion, achieving 23% of the Brazilian fuel market . With this acquisition , Ipiranga returned to operate in the Midwest, North and Northeast regions of the country .", "After almost being sold, Shell Brasil's oil products business started to grow again in the late 2010s. Eventually the JV formation with Cosan took place. Many factors contributed for the end of this case. First, the economic environment and the profile of the Shell CEO before the JV formation boost growth to the company. One of the interviews classified this CEO’s profile as a “growth person” . His fame inside the company and in the market is that of an aggressive entrepreneur. This businessman knew a Cosan executive and during a business lunch they discussed a possible partnership b etween the two companies. The protagonist of this emergent strategy (MINTZBERG; WATERS, 1985) reported the story: Uma vez tive um almoço com o [ executive name preserved] … a Shell nessa época tinha treze, quatorze por cento de market share, a Esso tinha entre oito e nove por cento de market share e a Ipiranga tinha vinte por cento e a Cosan tinha acabado de adquirir a Esso há um ano atrás [sic]. E nós discutimos, então, começou a se discutir a possibilidade da joint venture . [INT9] Interviewers say that t his idea would have been unthinkable probably in the whole Shell’s life in Brazil. Shell has rigid operation standards, it shows aversion to operational risk only comparable to other reputable MNE’s who prefers to pay more for keeping HSSE activities (health, safety, security, and environment ) standards at a high level. A partnership with a Brazilian company could jeopardize such operational standards , as stated by the interviewe e [INT8]: . “para Shell era um grande experimento que é pouco contra cultural, mas ao final, acho que agora é bem aceito ”[INT8] However, at the company's headquarters, there was a new strategic focus gaining momentum, supporting large investments in clean fuels , as observed interviewee [INT9] .", "“e nesse momento a Shell, o Peter Voser era o presidente, a Shell já estava com a visão estratégica global de clean fuels, de energia alternativa. Então, juntou uma oportunidade muito boa, porque qual foi a discussão , não foi só fazer uma fusão de companhia distribuidora de petróleo, mas trazer junto também todas as usinas da Cosan, como você sabe, é a maior produtora mundial de etanol que estava em linha com que a Shell também tinha na estratégia global, que era de C lean Fuels, como hoje em dia, até hoje, a Shell é líder nisso. [INT9] In 20 10 Raízen was created, and Shell strengthen ed its strategic intent in Brazil . Lately, the company recovered its high performance and went public on the country's stock exchange, having been one of the largest IPOs in the history of the Brazilian capital market, raising R$ 6.9 billion for the company's cash The Brazilian downstream oil market has always been concentrated.", "However, in the middle of its history the market concentration was on the hands of circa ten major distributors, mostly or almost all MNEs, whereas today there are only three large oil product distributors, all of them national companies where Shell is a shareholder and co -controller of one of them. The state -owned oil company is the market leader, and it has recently dropped out of government control (ANP, 2020) .", "Two-thirds of the diesel market is on the hands of only three companies. BR Distribuidora (whose government is still a relevant share holder, despite not controlling anymore ) has a 29% market share in diesel , the Brazilian group Ultra (which owns the Ipiran ga brand) has 20% and Raízen ( IJV of Shell with Cosan) has 18%. The gasoline market is also concentrated in the hands of those three players, who accounted for 60% of total sales , BR has a 23.4% market share, Ipiranga 19.3% and Raízen 16.9% (ANP, 2020) .", "There are now more than a hundred smaller distributors, some of them still involved in tax evasion and product tampering, albeit to a lesser extent than decades ago. According to Fundação Getulio Vargas (2021) , currently 14 billion reais are yearly evaded from the fuel sector in Brazil and t he total active debt of companies in the fuel sector that \"constantly\" evade state taxes, operating in a predatory manner, is estimated at 70 billion reais.", "The “bandeira branca” (“white flags”) stations represent today almost half of the number of gas stations in Brazil (ANP, 2020) . As seen, t hese companies are characterized by having no brand, which is the reason why they are called “white flags” and some of them still do not hesitate to evade taxes and adulterate fuels sold to their customers. These agents of the o il market were introduced with the Brazilian market liberalization, which not only allowed these new entrants, but also was highly permissive with the unfair competition that many of these agents brought to the Brazilian oil products market. Clearly in a s urvival movement, Shell eventually formed a joint venture with a local partner forming Raízen company with 50% of its shares.", "The current scenario is a consequence of this historical process that the oil sector has gone through in Brazil. The protective measures imposed by the Brazilian government throughout history brought out an inhospitable environment for the incumbent players. The regulation and deregulation process brought clear, evident and important consequences for the sector. If, on the one hand , the environment was hostile for incumbents, on the other hand, it was especially pious for the state distributor. The result was the unfolding of this story, which still has a few chapters to finish and remains exciting for those who are still part of it . Next, the case of Shell in the context described in this section will be studied vis a vis the theoretical lenses that was previously reviewed.", "In this section , the theoretical elements identified to the facts reported in the research will be included, considering the three previously defined phases of the history of the sector in the country.

SHELL CASE IN PHASE 1 – SPECTACULAR GROWTH OF", "SAMENESS Although full of crises in the contextual environment, such as the remnants of the Encilhamento crisis, impacts of the first war and the 1929 crisis in the US, which had global consequences, not excluding Brazil, high level of corruption in the country, 1930 coup d'état, Shell had a fabulous growth path in the first phase of the oil industry history in Brazil. Since it arrived in Brazil in 1913 , until 1931, Shell operated in the country in a period characterized by low or no government intervention in the market. The company gr owth was concurrent with the country's growth, in an era marked by the creation and rise of the Brazilian automobile market, constructions of roads, industrialization, and urbanization. Shell led a dawning and promising market and together with other multinational companies that arrived in the country since the 1910s had enjoyed benefits from a strong growth. The market leadership was disputed between Shell Brasil5 and ExxonMobil or the Standa rd Oil Company do Brasil , as ExxonMobil was called at that time6.", "During this first phase of the oil sector in Brazil, the market was concentrated in the hands of Shell and Exxon. Texaco and Atlantic was smaller compan ies, compared with Shell and Exxon. It is possible to infer that at that time the competition level , the constraints to profitable business activities level and efficiency pursuit were low due to (i) relatively high entry barriers, providing the role of government on approving MNE’s entries and cost disadvantages independent of scale, especially due to the learning or experience curve of operating in Brazil, achieved by the incumbents installed in the country since the beginning of the second decade of the XX century, (ii) relatively low rivalry among existing competitors, due to the not many firms that dominated a fast growing market, (iii) no pressure from substitute products, (iv) low or no bargaining power of buyers at that time, (v) no bargaining power of suppliers, given that the oil companies were vertically integrated.", "It is also possible to infer that innovation and quality improvement at that time came from the origins of the MNEs competing in the country. The innovation", "5 As seen in 4.1.1 , at that Shell Brasil was called Anglo -Mexican Petroleum Products Co. LTD 6 Later, the Standard Oil changed its name for Esso Standard do Brasil Inc. and even later Esso Brasileira de Petróleo, being the name Esso the phonetic version of the initials \"S\" and \"O\" of Standard Oil. presented in the oil products business in Brazil was ge nerally a reasonable, if not complete, replication of the renewal that Shell provided in its international markets. Therefore, r enewal was faintly promoted by the headquarters . However, evaluating it relatively to the competition, renewal was appropriately met because Shell brought to Brazil a complete infrastructure for the distribution of oil products, which perfectly served the market at the time , bringing novelties such as gasoline pumps and the equipment necessary for fueling aircraft. Shell operated in the country as an international organization since at that time both forces for global integration and local responsiveness were low or inexistent . According to Sindipetro (2021) , during this period nothing significative was made by the industry because the MNEs here operating had concessions in Venezuela , Mexico, the Middle East, and some other countries. These companies showed no interest in investing outside those areas that contained expressive oil reserves exploited at a low cost. These companies dominated the technology of refining and international transport. Their large refineries, located mainly in their countries of origin led to an attractive profit that the activity provided. In phase 1, e fficiency was not rewarded, inefficiency was not punished, and protecting the status quo was somehow institu tionalized.", "For this reason, it is possible to conclude that t he industry was experimenting a forgiving environment . Therefore , in this period Shell predominantly experimented a growth of size . As a characteristic idiosyncrasy of forgiving environments, an apathetic behavior of the sector participants regarding organizational renewal was observed at this time.", "The business model of importing oil products directly from its parent company and distributing them in the national territory worked successfully in the first period of Shell's history. The business environment did not bring reasons for the company to invest in exploration or refining in Brazil, nor to dare to renew products and services, much less its business model. Moreover, local entrepreneurs and business communities did not have technology or financial resources to invest in this industry.", "All the prevalent mechanisms of growth were supposedly7 present .", "Therefore, as Figure 9 shows , considering that entirely managing with all the", "7 Lack of data for analyzing earlier phases of the history of the oil products industry is one of the reported limitations of this research on section 3.5.", "three mechanisms of organizational growth characterizes a self -perpetuating ideal state of surviving (FLECK, 2009) and the actual state of existence was sound (FLECK, forthcoming ).", "4.2.2.

Ela tinha uma posição muito forte na área de mercado propriamente dito, de B2B, como a gente hoje, e muito forte também a aviação. A Esso participava em mais de sessenta aeroportos no Brasil, e um belo dia chegou -se à conclusão [de] que o segmento já não era tão rentável como s e imaginava no passado com a chegada da Petrobr as. Simplesmente ela pegou boa parte desses aeroportos, diria que setenta por cento, são muitos aeroportos regionais. Incrível, o Brasil no passado, o meio aéreo era muito maior do que é hoje, se você for ver número de aeroportos e linhas aéreas ligando cidadezinhas pequenas às capitais.

In the 1990's, Petrobras sales terms to distribution companies were generally 8 days and the sales terms of distribution companies to their reseller cus tomers was only 2 days. During this phase inflation reached a rate of thousands of percentage points per year. As a result, the oil companies made extraordinary financial profit s as it will be discussed next .", "Despite the increased government intervention in the market in the second phase of the history of the oil products market in Brazil, it is possible to argue that the state of the environment on this occasion was also Forgiving. The creation and capture of value was maintained by Shell, which, accordin g to reports, achieved market leadership, surpassing ExxonMobil in the 60s. The creation and capture of value occurred through the exploitation of activities already tested or traditionally used by the organization. The lack of efficiency was discovered in the next phase of the history of the oil products market in Brazil, at a time when Shell needed it most.

[IN19] Globalization was an important part of the context of this phase, giving rise to global integration forces (BARTLETT; GHOSHAL, 1987) within the Royal Dutch Shell. As a result, initiatives such as gl obal streamlining, management of global brand s and product s began to emerge in Shell Brasil . Globalization has also brought more country connection with effects of international crises, which in this period it is possible to cite the Asian crisis, the subp rime crisis. In this phase, crises were also triggered within the national environment, such as two presidential impeachments (1992 and 2016), crisis in the national energy sector, and the most recent economic crisis that continues to this day.", "As in the p revious phase, there is no abundant data to show at this moment how the fundamental growth mechanisms were in the second phase of the history of the oil products market in Brazil. It is possible to infer, however, that the renewal continued to present itse lf mainly through the importation of company ideas and actions carried out in other parts of the world. Likewise, slack and integrity were assumed to be appropriate, although as already argued, the forgiving environment was certainly hidden inefficiency, c onsequently concealing organizational waste.", "Some of the few examples of innovation at this stage were : launch of new products such as furniture polish, stain remover and window cleaner in the 1940s , the launch of ethanol fuel, imposed by the government t hrough a national program called Proalcool , and Shell gasoline with ICA (Ignition Control Additive), a failed product launch ed in the 1950s due to high import costs, but successfully relaunched in the following decade. In comparison with the competition, h owever, it is reasonably to argue that renewal was properly found in the company. Also in the 1950s, Shell established its chemical products department and in the decades the company grew organically and inorganically, establishing in the 1970s a JV with t he company Petróleo Sabbá, which operates in the north of the country, and Billiton Metais, a global company of the Shell Group in the area of non-ferrous metals.", "4.2.3. SHELL IN PHASE 3 – SAVE THE TREE, SURVIVAL GROWTH", "Regulation was a gold mine for oil companies operating in th e forgiving environment that was in place in the previous phases of the history of the oil products sector in Brazil . An interviewee representing a Shell ’s competitor in Brazil provided an idea of the earnings of the oil companies at this time: the distributor's gross margin was $100 million per month, freight reimbursements [from the government] another $100 million per month. Although oil companies had hitherto earned substantial profits, operational inefficiency generated losses at Shell Brasil , but extremely smaller than the financial gains that were generated. A Shell Brasil finance executive explained: o resultado da companhia era mais ou menos esses 50 milhões de dólares, o que mudou ao longo do tempo era que na época no Sector Analysis8 você tinha dois setores, você tinha o setor 13 e o 81. O 13, era o setor operacional e o 81 era o financeiro, no 13, nessa época você tinha basicamente prejuízo, e você tinha o resultado totalmente vindo do financeiro em apli cação de overnight. Não sei se você lembra desse momento, mas a gente no automotivo mesmo você trabalhava pagando Petrobras em D +8 e vendia D+2, praticamente era todo mundo a vista, e você brincava num capital de giro negativo aí de 6 dias, que não era exa tamente de 6 dias por causa da diferença de valor", "8 Sector Analysis was an internal report mas, aproximadamente de 5 ou 6 dias de capital de giro negativo e aí com isso é que vinha o lucro.

The company somehow needed to reject this idea and at the same time prepare for a possi ble deregulation process that eventually happened at this stage of history, becoming more efficient. Shell Brasil had difficulties in understand ing the complex picture that was being formed in the business environment at that time .", "gerir uma empresa no Brasil é entender o ambiente, entender o ambiente do país, da política, como funciona a economia, dentro dos setores e posso dizer, depois de ter experiência de trabalhar em vários países, que nesse sentido, o Brasil é um país complicado . [INT8] As seen in the previous section , this period of the history of the oil products sector in Brazil was really complicated, inspiring the name given in this work for this phase , this was a time of economic order and market disorder . In Brazil, inflation was finally con trolled, but the industry's deregulation process was a disaster for the business . The oil price was falling in the international market , putting pressure on Shell globally. Furthermore, there was the possibility of new entrants to the market, which in fact happened. In the late 1990s and the first decade of the 2000s, the Italian Agip, the Spanish Repsol and the Venezuelan PDVSA entered the market. None of these international companies were successful in Brazil in the sector studied, but at the time they co nstituted a threat. An interviewee described the scenario experienced at that time: (…) Em noventa e oito tinha uma queda [de preço do] óleo cru, bastante… muito foco em redução de custos globalmente, na área de downstream ... a gente estava olhando novos entrantes em vários mercados, a gente estava se preparando em como atuar em um ambiente mais competitivo. Então, a gente desenvolveu uma forma de olhar p ara os mercados e achar respostas p ara atuar nesses mercados, se chamava global retail strategy review. ... [ano de] noventa e nove, dois mil, o desafio tinha muito a ver com deregulation, sonegação e adulteração. [INT14] Shell took several initiatives for dealing with the changes that were in course. These initiative s included cost reductions, optimization of the service stations network, selling or disposing of the so -called tail businesses, which consisted of the many gas stations that represented little in terms of sales volume and margin, and proposals of changing the business model. The initiatives were innumerable , although those with the most relevant impact have never been put in pract ice due to internal resistance and the formation of antagonistic coalition groups. The company's top executives at that time had very different profiles: the well-connected with the stakeholders, the foreigner, the relentless cost cutter, the charismatic, and finally the entrepreneur. According to an interviewee, Shell is a healthy centenary organization because of its capacity of dealing with a dynamic environment. However, at that time Shell’s destiny in Brazil was threatened. A Shell é uma empresa tão gr ande, centenária, que ela tem inteligência que em alguns momentos, ela tem que botar gente para chacoalhar, outros momentos tem que botar gente para curar e outros momentos tem que botar gente com perfil para desenvolver e tocar um negócio, porque chacoalh ar demais a árvore, a árvore pode quebrar e quase aconteceu aqui, quase aconteceu. [INT12] The image of breaking the tree provided the interviewee has to do with the Agonizing state of existence that the company lived at that time (see Figure 9), particularly regarding its organizational integrity. By downsizing, Shell Brasil lost competent people and the ones that stayed in the company and the new ones that entered formed two conflictual groups. Disagreements have g one so far as to destroy relationships on a personal level, leading to layoffs. metade da gerência era pessoal novo, todo mundo focado na entrega de resultado, esse tipo de coisa e a outra metade era o pessoal antigo e vivia em conflito, esse tipo de cois a. Aí entrei, fui fazer aquele curso em São Paulo, na minha volta teve uma confusão, mas aí não de caráter de só de relacionamento, no meio dessa confusão toda, quatro pessoas entraram numa briga gigantesca pessoal, que era o gerente de vendas, o chefe de vendas, o assessor de planejamento e o antigo assessor de planejamento; bom, resumo da ópera é que os quatro foram demitidos. [INT10] The process of changing Shell's business model in the 1990s was an example of internal rivalry generated between the \"expl oiting\" coalition, formed by those committed to maintaining the business model that ha d always been a success, and the \"exploring\" coalition, formed by the people engaged in moving forward with a new action proposal to face a new business scenario that was to come . On the one hand, several work groups and projects were created, often completed, and approved to be put into practice. On the other hand, the resistance to putting new business ideas into practice was considerable to the point that some projects never got off the ground.", "Eles três [executivos sêniore s] pegaram todas as premissas do [projeto] cost leadership, [do modelo de negócios de] posto próprio, aquela equipe de assessores [mais juniores e mais econômica] e tudo mais, jogaram tudo no lixo no dia seguinte. Quiseram fazer a mesma estrutura com o que estava lá . [INT10] Meanwhile, the company was losing market share and not adapting adequately to more deregulation measures and the economic plan that were about to come. During the turmoil several fruitless investments were made. With the implementation of the economic stabilization plan (“Plano Real”) and the end of inflation, the company's source of wealth disappeared. There was an understanding that the company needed to further downsize, in order to grow stronger in the future.", "2001, 2002, a gente decidiu de reduzir a rede… de purificar a rede, purificar a plataforma operacional, p ara ser mais ágil de adaptar ao mercado, então a gente é, mudou de formato, modelo de contratos, tirando dinheiro [investimentos] da Shell… os ativos do mercado, mas… e também mudar a forma de atuar com a revenda. E fazer um plano, uma campanha pública p ara deixar as pessoas saber que adulteração é al guma coisa que a Shell levou a sério, que você é… quando você abastece num posto Shell você pode ter a certeza que qualidade está lá. Então, tudo isso foi uma resposta p ara se habituar a realidade desse momento do mercado. Mas a gente tinha sempre um olhar para o futuro, p ara longo prazo, como vamos resolver, sair desse buraco, então a gente vai de quatro mil postos p ara dois mil postos, mas aí a gente tem uma base de [para] crescer de novo [INT14] This was s imple to say, yet practically impossible to do. In addition to the conflicting groups, the organization formed several silos at the headquarters of the Brazilian subsidiary, generally made up of people from different departments. Such silos spread throughout the organization across the country. According to an interviewee, os silos que existiam na sede, se espalharam pelo Brasil, o pessoal de vendas era só pessoal de vendas, o pessoal do pessoal, os amigos eram só de venda, o pessoal de planejamento era só planejamento, o pessoal de conveniência, na época , isso já existia, era só conveniência. Então, passou, passaram a existir, meio que Silos, que cada um, obviamente, seu mantinha seus relacionamentos e, principalmente, também, olhava muito p ara os seus [próprios] resultados sem se preocupar nos resultados como um todo e essa questão só se juntava lá na vice -presidência, então, os silos ficaram fortes . [INT10] Organizational integrity operated close to the self -destructive pole of fragmentation , leading to failure to establish bonding relations and coordinating capabilities (FLECK, 2009) . Organizational waste was also found, especially with travell ing expenses , events such as at conventions, awards to employees or customers on cruise ships, unproductive investments, bad credits, and so on . [Em] 2003 , só em Miami eu fui cinco vezes com projeto e reuniões. Buenos Aires ia todo mês ou a cada todo trime stre. Não passava trimestre eu estava em Buenos Aires. [INT16] eu vim aqui [do Brasil para Miami ], passei 5 dias quase 6 dias viajando para nada . [INT22] Shell Brasil fez muito investimento, muito, duzentos milhões de dólares por ano, muitos investimentos do ponto de vista da matriz, mal feit os, tinha também muita perda de créditos com revendedores que não pagaram bad debts [INT14] abriu -se posto com loja de conveniência, em áreas de consumo que não comportavam loja de conveniência . [INT22]", "The desired results seemed to be only achieved with the Shell JV with Cosan in 201 1. The decision -making process turned to be more agile, a new culture was formed, and growth has returned .", "Você entrega um negócio [a ser decidido] na quarta, na sex ta-feira você tem a conversa, já tem a decisão tomada. Entendeu? Assim, é nesse sentido, a nossa velocidade [de decisão] é outra ... dentro da área Comercial, a gente tem uma obsessão por crescimento ... Por crescer, continuar crescendo, continuar crescend o, isso é o que move a empresa, a cada ano a gente vinha, vinha não, vem agregando praticamente um bilhão de litros de volume novo dentro da empresa.", "[INT4] 70% dos funcionários não foram nem de Shell, nem de Esso, nem de Cosan. São funcionários já Raízen, nasceram dentro disso. ... a junção deu muito certo ... com a sociedade, com os revendedores com os resultados econômicos, com os acionistas . [INT6] o resultado que a Shell fazia no Brasil, especificamente do meu negócio, e que a Esso fazia, a Raízen, assim no primeiro ano, já foi fazendo 10 vezes melhor, assim de bate pronto . [INT5] In ten years of operations, the Cosan -Shell JV gave birth to a new organizational culture, a more agile decision making, a more effective capability of market respo nses, and a more efficient cost structure and control. The outcomes can be viewed in terms of market share as displayed on Figure 2 as well as through its financial results, which motivated the company to carry out one of the largest IPOs in the history of the Brazilian capital market. With the entry of new shareholders, Shell and Cosan share ownership is represented by 44% of each company's shares. For financially supporting its growth, the company also achieved investmen t grade.", "5 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION", "The history of the oil products market in Brazil has undergone profound changes, impacting the management of organizations that compete for healthy and sustainable growth. Analyzing this case study through a historical narrative and using the pertinent theoretical frameworks, made feasible to understand how growth affects organizational survival states in a dynamic and challenging business environment . The visible hand of the government has introduced several measur es to protect local activities in the oil sector. In so doing, an inhospitable environment emerged for most of the industry's competitors, while at the same time a forgiving environment prevailed for the government favored, notably the national oil company and some dominant social groups . ExxonMobil was market leader in the first phase of history of the oil sector in Brazil. When exited the country in 2007, Exxon had only 7% of market share. In a reasonably similar way, Shell had a 22% market share in the early 1990s and when it partnered with Cosan it had only 13%. This work portrayed this phenomenon tracing a history that has not been told, in a way that helped to discern the growth challenges faced by companies in the industry .", "Shell struggled to put i nto practice the necessary changes for a new scenario in Brazil. Unfair competition in the inhospitable environment that Shell faced in the country throughout its centenary oil products business was a great challenge, but it was not the only one. This stud y showed that the Shell’s battle for healthy organizational survival and growth did not only take place in th e inhospitable environment , especially occurred at the beginning of the phase 3 of this history . Indeed, the battle started when the environment wa s in the Forgiving state. If Shell and the other MNEs did not lose their battles, they certainly lost efficiency, as predicted by the Fleck’s model.", "Certainly, unintended, and perhaps unnoticed, Shell has failed to promote the necessary renewal to adapt it s business model to the inhospitable environment. Plans and action programs were even approved, however, silos and coalitions had formed and imposed resistance to put them into practice. At the same time, old habits, and customs of the golden prodigal time s to a large extent continued.", "A sharp downsizing has reduced costs, but it has also stripped away much of the talent and slack needed for healthy growth. The “tree was shaken a lot, it almost fell ”, symbolically said a former senior executive. According to Fleck's model, the company's ideal and actual states of existence in the third phase of the oil distribution market's history were respectively self -destruction and agonizing.", "Shell Brasil managed to improve its results in the early 2000s and at a global level, the clean fuels strategy gain ed strength. ExxonMobil's assets, which had a very well maintained and efficient service station network, were sold to Cosan. Cosan, in turn, had no experience in the oil sector. A business idea was born that brought together Shell with a national partner that represents one of the largest ventures in the sugar and alcohol sector in the world . This partnership can potentially help advance the Anglo -Dutch company's global clean fuel strategy and increase its su bsidiary's local responsiveness, making it more effective and efficient in dealing with the challenging Brazilian business environment. The JV with Cosan brought growth to Shell's downstream oil business in Brazil. Shell's experience with JV with local pa rtners in Brazil is nothing new. As seen in chapter 4 above , in 1971 the company signed a JV with IB Sabbá for the operation of distribution of oil products in the northern region of the country. In Upstream, Shel l has several partnerships with the national state oil company and many others foreign companies operating in the country. In Upstream it is a tradition that JVs are formed to support the intensive capitalization and inherent risks of the business.", "Having managed to survive the inhospitable conditions, Shell has certainly acquired resilience and has already thrived in the first ten years of partnership with Cosan. It seems that the growth issues faced by Shell in the 1990s were solved or at least minimized or temporarily mitigated with the JV formation in its downstream business in Brazil with Cosan. However, Debellis et al. (2020) note a dramatic increase in the number of International joint ventures in the last two decades, revealing that most of them end up failing. Thus, a n investigation of the organization of this joint venture is a suggestion for future studies. This case brought several lessons learned. The first is that the country's business environment has been challenging since the beginning of this century - old history until today. There were important crises in the three phases of the oil products history in Brazil. Apparently, the re is no scenario where these crises and the consequent volatility of the business environment reduces in Brazil. For this reason, companies operating in Brazil must be aware of the challenges of growth in a dynamic business environment . Looking at this complex phenomenon with the lenses of the theoretical frameworks applied in this study, it is expected that those companies can give appropriate responsiveness to the local mark et demands even when global integration also applies . At least, the risky position reached by the studied company should be avoided with the lessons here learned.", "To help look at this complexity and manage it , Fleck's model shows the necessary conditions f or the healthy growth and survival of companies. Shell's management was successful, considering its purpose of keeping its business in Brazil. Now, r enewal, slack and integrity have apparently returned to levels that lead the company back to a self -perpetu ating survival state. This study showed that this was not always the case and that for a period, certainly unintentionally and probably without much awareness, Shell management tested the limit of self - destruction in the beginning of the third phase of oil products history in Brazil . A theoretical contribution of this work is the evidence tha t the I/R framework is a useful complement in the assessment of growth challenges for studying multinational companies with the Fleck's model. The jointly use of both models makes the assessment of survival states more robust and assertive. Considering Van de Ven and P oole (1995) theoretical framework , a dialectical model could be used as an ideal type of explanation of process es of growth in dynamic and challenging business environments and how they affect organizational survival states.", "As in the I/R model there is a te nsion between external forces for adaptation and response to the local environment in different host countries, and forces for a standardized approach, leading to global efficiency through global integrated behavior, clearly there is a conflict that emerge s between parent and subsidiary entities.", "Theoretically, according to Van de Ven and Poole (1995), this conflict can be seen as opposing thesis and antithesis that collide to produce a synthesis, which in time becomes the thesis for the next cycle of a dialectical progression. Applying this Dialectical model to this case, it can be suggested tha t the globalization process and Shell's global strategy lead to the global forces of integration and those of local responsiveness to get out of balance. The imbalance increased when Shell Brasil's core growth mechanisms weakened. As a result, several acti ons promoted by the global forces prevailed and were implemented. The further weakening of Shell Brasil has almost made the company part of the group of other multinationals that have closed their doors in the country. Shell Brasil remained in the country, but reached an agonizing state of existence at the beginning of the phase 3 period of its history. Eventually, a sufficient degree of force , power and legitimacy overturn the current produce d a synthesis. This synthesis in practical terms consist ed of the proposal and execution of the formation of the JV between Shell and Cosan , which clearly was an Mintzbergian emergent strategy .", "A new balance was reached largely due to the global clean fuel strategy and the possibility of changing the deteriorating state of the company fundamental growth mechanisms and eventually grow. The global forces were strengthened with the new business merger, with relevant size , that meets its strategy , as Cosan is one of the largest conglomerates in the sugar -alcohol sector in the world. Local forces were also strengthened by the possibility of the emergence of a new organizational culture, with new talents, a new corporate governance that apparently solve d local demands that had not been met before. The agility in decision making now implemented increased its potential capacity for renewal, the new people and culture resolved the integrity problems that the company had and returned the slack to a satisfact ory level. Evidence of this can be found in the following statements:", "A Shell é grande, tradicionalmente o setor de petróleo era um setor onde não faltava dinheiro, então o foco em custos, manter os custos a nível adequados, não foi o melhor do mundo, não . E com a Cosan, eles têm um enfoque no custo enorme. [INT8] Às vezes é mais político dentro de uma empresa do que em um joint venture, 9and in a joint venture it will be very black and white in some points, I want this, you want that. And in a company is like well, I mean, I think I am responsible to make this decision, “no, you are not” I mean “I will go my boss, I will go to my boss” and then it takes another two months before the problem get solved… aqui não dá. [INT14] a Shell espera que a Raízen poss a contribuir de forma muito importante na questão da busca dela com uma matriz muito mais limpa e da redução das emissões. Obviamente tem um veículo downstream, que aí é a questão da força da rede, tamanho da rede, crescimento nosso", "9 The interviewee spontaneously changed the language used in the interview em Conveniência e outra s coisas. Mas isso aí, eu diria que é o business mais tradicional da Shell e que aí sim não faz muita diferença se é a Raízen ou se é a Shell direto, no sentido, é claro que a gente agora tem uma rede de mais de 7 mil postos, quando você junta Argentina e Brasil, a Shell quando fez a fusão tinha dois mil e quinhentos postos, ... então em 12 anos teria triplicado a rede e saiu de um market share de menos de 12% na época para mais de 21, com a marca Shell no Brasil e estamos crescendo também na Argentina, ent ão assim, o case Downstream é um super case. Para te dar um número, o EBITDA combinado da Shell mais a Esso, mas da Shell sozinha antes da fusão era 400 milhões de reais por ano. No exercício a gente fechou, porque a gente fechou agora em março então eu nã o posso dar o número ainda, mas no exercício que a gente fechou na safra passada, a gente fez 2.850 bilhões. [INT7]", "As a contribution to the practice of management, it was clear that global forces led the multinational company to distance itself from the reality of the Brazilian market. Responsiveness was slow and often ineffective. The three drivers of growth, renewal, slack and integrity, have approached the pole that drives organizations into a state of self -destruction and agonizing, which is extremely risky. This research recommends management to evaluate international, multinational, global or transnational management strategies vis a vis the central drivers of growth , and the local states of the environment , to identify or predict the actual and idea l states of organizational existence. Growth affects organizational survival states in dynamic environments as their mechanisms progress or regress in the scale of self -perpetuation or self - destruction archetypes (FLECK, 2009) . These mechanisms are the fundamental structure that can lead organizations to actual states of existence (FLECK, 2018, forthcoming ), as shown in Table 5. This triple structure should be strong enough to keep the balance between global forces for integration and local forces for responsiveness (BARTLETT; GOSHAL, 1989) . This seems to form a framework composed of no longer 3, but 5 fundament al theoretical pillars that need to be in balance, despite the challenges of dynamic environments . These pillars are global integration forces, local forces of responsiveness, slack, integrity, and renewal . It is during the states of Forgiving environments that management attention must be redoubled, otherwise, when the dynamism of the environment demands, there may not be forces to maintain the positive balance between these 5 pillars of growth in MNEs. In such a way, the organization ’s healthy survival state will be at stake.", "REFERENCES ALBERTI, V. Histórias Dentro da História. In: Fontes Históricas . 2. ed.

One of such methods is the utilization of crowdfunding models. In particular League of Legends, Dota 2, and SMITE, this research studies three to propose a new type of crowdfunding model.", "The study is divided into three major parts, the theoretical discussion, the case analysis, and the incentive -based crowdfunding model conceptualization and validity. The first part embrac es the ongoing debate in the crowdfunding literature going through the difficulty of setting to the different types of crowdfunding, ending in the fusion and adaptation of the various tools used to categorize and analyze crowdfunding.", "The second part is th e center of the research. The cases looked at using the lens and tools developed in the previous part provided enough reason to believe that the crowdfunding model used by the three e -sports mentioned is not one that is already categorized. Thus, in the en d, deriving the relations and particularities of the new incentive -based crowdfunding model.

This thriving sector evolved at a fast pace since its appearance in the 1970s with the Computer Space by Nutting Associates in 1971 and the famous Atari Pong game in 1972 Tyson (2020) , moving from single -player and local multiplayer simple games to the g reat variety that is seen today with games for all tastes and ages.", "One of these sub -categories of video -games is competitive video -games. There is no clear definition of what is a competitive video -game since it covers a wide variety of the sector . Howeve r, it is possible to understand what a competitive video -game is by looking at what players define as competitive. In Steam, the biggest online video -game retailer, platform users suggest and vote for which category a game belongs ; in the search for the “c ompetitive” category , it easy to see two clear parameters that users use to define competitive: multiplayer and competing against other players.", "Using these parameters , competitive video -games can be defined simply as a game that puts players to compete against each other. Like traditional competitions , we call sports, when a game turns to be competitive enough , tournaments and leagues start to appear , and thus the profe ssional scenario of video -games appeared.", "Today many e -sports came to be from the old days of StarCraft 2 to newcomers like Fortnite. The sector faces, as of today, great competition with many companies trying to make the new great hit with popular genres ; in the past , it was the MOBA dispute with many big players like Blizzard and Valve making their own (Heroes of the Storm and DotA 2 respectively) and new companies like Riot with League of Legends trying to compete, today the battle royale dispute is rag ing with Fortnite, PUBG and Apex legends being the most popular ones Clement (2019, 2020) .", "Looking further, the numbers justify the investment many small and big companies make. Forecasts to e -sports viewership reach more than 600 million viewers by 2023 , with more than 250 million being frequent viewers Gough (2020) . Also, projections for revenues range from 1.5 billion to more than 3 billion dollars by 2022 Reyes (2021) .", "This research ultimately focus ed only on a small part of the e -sports scenario, the MOBA sub-genre. In this scenario , we have two of the most popular e -sports with League of Legends and Defense of the Ancients 2 Hore (2020) , millions in prize pools Earnings (2020) , and, more importantly , the crowdfunding models used by the publishers.", "1.2 – Academic relevance Crowdfunding is a recent movement and is being studie d by many scholars in a great variety of fields with prominence in finance and psychology. With being so new , the gaps in the literature are many as there is no real consensus on the topic.", "The more important gaps are in the backbone of all research topics, the definition , and the typology. As of today, there is no majorly accepted definition of crowdfunding whic h leads to confusion and lack of guidelines to properly categorize the myriad of crowdfunding models. With a further look , the literature usually does not deviate from studying traditional crowdfunding platforms like Kickstarter and models , as can be seen with prominent researchers like Belleflame, Agrawal , and Mollick. In a way, this characteristic brings consistency to many studies . On the other hand, this narrows the concept and the models of crowdfunding and does not permit new models to the topic even though they fall in the definition of crowdfunding given by many of these authors.", "In this confus ing scenario , this research has three major purposes . The first two have structural implications in the literature , with ten being to try to create an acceptable definition for crowdfunding that is not t oo narrow and not t oo wide (a major criticism made by Mollick, 2014, that will be seen further down), create a set of multi -disciplinary parameters that can and will ca tegorize the accepted and new crowdfunding models and types. The last one is to contribute by providing a new type of crowdfunding that is not displayed in the literature. 1.3 – Managerial relevance Adding to the contribution to the literature, this study also has the goal to contribute to companies that have or are trying to implement crowdfunding as on e of their financing s and/or revenue tools.", "As stated before, the e -sports scene is growing at a fast pace Reyes (2020) , and companies are trying to create a new hit that will win the preference of players. To gain an edge over the competitors is a must and some ways to do it is to have solid financing, create a healthy player community , and carefully understand the needs and desires of your player base.", "As will be seen in this study, crowdfunding is a possible solution to gain that edge over competitors. In the cases of League of Legends, Defense of the Ancients 2 and SMITE companies developed successful crowdfunding models to fill their needs being then financing problems in the case of SMITE, more player interaction with DotA2 and more revenue like in League of Legends.", "By using these real cases, this research will derive viable crowdfunding models that can be adapt ed and used by new and incumbent companies in the e -sports market. Further, as will be seen in this research, these models are easily implemented given the virtual nature of video - games and can give great results if properly made.", "2 -- Literature Review This section show s what the literature o n crowdfunding has developed so far and what is generally accepted by scholars on the topic. This section is the backbone of the research giving the definition used through all the research and the base used to create a method to categorize crowdfunding models and types.", "2.1 – Definition of Crowdfunding Crowdfunding is a newly carved term from the last decade , and since it has been used in many different situations with varying meanings and definitions. To study it , a clear definition with parameters is needed. This is no easy task as there is no set definition in the literature of crowdfunding.", "The concept of crowdfunding is usually defined as a derivation from the concepts of micro -finance (Morduch, 1999) and/or crowdsourcing (Poetz & Schreier, 2012 ; Howe, 2006a, 2006b ); in both cases , there is a key feature exclusive to crowdfunding, fundraising. In this sense , some authors state the crowdfunding is just another form of crowdsourcing designed to raise funds , like Schwienbacher and Larralde (2010) , crowdfunding is “an open call, essenti ally through the Internet, for the provision of financial resources either in the form of donation or in exchange for some form of reward and/or voting rights to support initiatives for specific purposes.” This definition is criticized by Mollick (2014) as an expansive definition that still leaves cases and examples of crowdfunding outside its spectrum ; some examples the well - accepted lending -based crowdfunding described as peer -to-peer lending in Lin , Prabhala , and Viswanathan (2013) and others in the following section.", "Another form used to define crowdfunding is the self -determination theory ; as described by Ryan and Deci (2000) , the theory presents two main needs that humans have to execute an action, intrinsi c and extrinsic motives. In the crowdfunding literature focused on phycology and linguistics , the definition of crowdfunding is derived from the motives a person has ; as stated by Yuan and Wang (2020) , a crowdfunding campaign is defined by the motives that the lexicon used to gather funders presents, with texts , not the main definers being motivations derived from relationship building and non -rewarded gratification. This study is backed by another focused on the entrepreneurial side of crowdfunding, follow ing Allison, Davis, Short , and Webb (2015) that had ; as a result, the motives resulted from narratives focused on helping others are more favorable than narratives based on investment opportunities. Thus, rendering the definition of crowdfunding as a resul t of successful application of motives to create the possibility of a crowdfunding campaign.", "For this research , the definition cannot be too limiting ; however , according to Mollick, to broaden the definition is to elude yourself since crowdfunding covers many cases across disciplines. Looking at this , Mollick gives a narrower definition but a more defined one, “crowdfunding refers to the efforts by entrepreneurial individuals and groups – cultural, social, and for -profit – to fund their ventures by drawing on relatively small contributions from a relatively large number of individuals using the internet, without standard financial intermediaries.” Mollicks` definition is very accurate when studying types such and reward -based and equity crowdfunding. Howeve r, in the cases studied in this research , it is to be see that those types are not present , so this definition is not the best suited. To solve this problem, it is a must to look back at crowdsourcing and broad Molli cks` definition enough to fit our resear ch, but not too much to elude ourselves.", "Crowdsourcing was first defined by Howe (2006a) in an online article as: “The act of taking a job traditionally performed by a designated agent (usually an employee) and outsourcing it to an undefined, generally large group of people in the form of an open call.” With Howe`s definit ion, it is important to see two key points that Mollick is lacking, the undefined groups and the undefined motives. With these , we can adapt Mollicks` definition to the following: c rowdfunding is refer ring to the effort of individuals and groups pushed by motives to fund their ventures by drawing on small contributions from a relatively large number of individuals or groups, without standard financial intermediaries.", "This definit ion does not fall in the same situation as Schwienbacher and Larralde 's one, and it is br oad enough to embrace many of its uses and accurate enough to not leave a creative mind fitting it in wrong uses. It has six key points, two from Howe and two form s Mollick , one common on both and one derived from the self -determination theory , that define what can be seen as crowdfunding or a crowdfunding model a nd what cannot, from Howe we have the ones from before, undefined motives and undefined groups and form Mollick we got the main point of fundraising and the lack of financial intermediaries, and from both the essentia l part of the prefix crowd, a large group of people contributing , but it would be all for nothing if the contributors did not have enough motive to do so thus introducing the motive part form self - determination theory .", "It is important to note that having a clear definition of crowdfunding is what allow s further categorization and modeling of crowdfunding models and types ; furthermore, by using other defini tions , all the setting s and modeling displayed in this research could not be fitted as crowdfunding. As the definition is a gray area with no global or major acceptance in the literature, to carve or adapt a definition is valid and contributes to this disc ussion. 2.2 – The types of crowdfunding Different from the definition of crowdfunding, the type s of crowdfunding are not globa lly but well accepted in the literature.", "From the literature , it is possible to categorize th e universe of crowdfunding in to four main types: reward -based, donation -based, c rowdlending , or lending -based and equity -based crowdfunding .", "Apart f rom the four main types, a new form of crowdfunding is being discovered, bu t given the immaturity of the literature regarding the m, these new types are still not well established and are not being considered relevant to this study.", "2.2.1- Reward -based crowdfunding Reward -based c rowdfunding is the type of crowdfunding that was traditiona lly called crowdfunding and is the most popular. In this category , crowdfunding is often a two -sided platform with founders on one side and funders on the other with a platform in the middle Also , reward -based crowdfunding has , as a result, both material and immaterial compensations, with ben efits ranging from pre -selling and pre -ordering, typical in the famous crowdfunding platform Kickstarter, giving both founders and funders material compe nsations (Hemer, Scneider, Dornbusch & Frey, 2011) to acknowledgment (Belleflamme, Lambert & Schweinbacher, 2013).", "This type of crowdfunding can also be masked and not be dir ectly expressed as crowdfunding. As an example , we have the early -access video ga mes present in many popular online s tores like Valve Corporation`s Steam and Epic Games` EGS. In this case , the consumer pays for a n in-development video -game from small and unrecognized studios, in the end secretly financing the development of the said vi deo-game.", "Also, to increase financing , many funders ' motivations can be stimulated like previews or demos of the final products , for example , early material compensation or funder 's name or dedication in the final product as a n immaterial compensation.", "2.2.2- Donation -based crowdfunding Donation -based crowdfunding is directly related to classic fundraising (Kraus, Richter, Brem. Cheng & Chang, 2016) , with its main di fference in the channel used for the donation. In this type of crowdfunding , it is expected to not rec eive material compensation (Giudici et al., 2012) , but instead , it is expected to rec eive immaterial compensation, often in the form of social rewards and/or acknowledgments (Leimeister & Zogaj, 2013).", "Some scholars studying the psychology behin d the motives of crowdfunding found the motives behin d donations in online philant hropic beha vior being expected to transpose to crowdfunding (Ge rber & H ui, 2013) . In this case , the motives could range from sympathy and empathy toward the cause (Rick et al. 2007), guilt for not contributing (Cialdini et al. 1981) , and an attempt to stre ngthen social identity (Aaker and Akutsu, 2009 ).", "2.2.3- Crowdle nding Crowdlending is the evolution of the microlending concept, following the original concept described by Spooner (1846) in his work offering micro -lending as a way to alleviate poverty via small entrepren eurial activities ; crowdlending just ad apts to the c rowdfunding environment by having numerous individual lenders instead of just one.", "This type is often used to fill the gap on the credit market usua lly filled by loan sharks , as the clients do not provide co llateral and d o not have access or the attractiv eness required by traditional financial institutions to fulfill their needs , usually entrepren eurial in nature , thus motivatin g entrep reneurial g rowth ( Battilana & Dorado, 2010 ).", "The mechanis m of reward in this type of crowdfunding is what is expected in a traditional loan, and funders will rec eive an interest agreed before the completion of the crowdlending process (Giudici et al., 2011) , making material interest the true motivating factor to fund. Since this type share familiarities with the financial sector counterpart , it has di fferent possible models, from private contracts, peer -to-peer lending , or even contracts between people and companies (Hemer et al., 2011, Mach, Carter & Slattery, 20 13).", "2.2.4- Equity-based crowdfunding Equity -based crowdfunding is a definition of the simplest form of crowdfunding.", "Funders back a project and rec eive in return equity proportional to the amount funded (Mollick, 2014), like crowdlending , this is the same as the traditional financial counterpart but with a crowd as funders and not banks of other financial institutions.", "Like in the financial system , the motive behind the funding is to rec eive equity and future prof its associated with that equity (Beck, 2012).", "Even though it is easy to define, equity -based crowdfunding has many complex models, but since the focus of this study does not perm eate this type of crowdfunding , it is best not to deepen in it.", "Figure 1 - Crowdfunding types 2.2.5 – Other types of crowdfunding New types of crowdfunding can be categorized into two main branches: not well - established derivations or subtypes of the previously mentioned types and completely new types of crowdfunding.", "On the first branch , we have the dual -class equity crowdfunding described by Cumming, Meoli , and Vismara (2019) as being an equity crowdfunding model , but the funder has the Reward -Based •P2B •Material -goods •Immaterial - acknowledgmentDonation -based •P2B •Immaterial – acknowledgment/soci al rewardCrowdlending •P2P •P2B •Material -interestEquity -based •P2B •Material – stocks/dividends choice of selection dividends or voting rights. Another similar type is the investment -based crowdfunding proposed by Rossi, Vismara , and Meoli (2018) , where the funder has no choice , but the founder displays the rules for voting ri ghts. Following the second branch , we have newly formed civic crowdfunding, as defined by Brent and Lorah (2019) ; this type of crowdfunding is specialized in giving a public good ; as a result, the community uses a crowdfunding platform to promote public p rojects. 2.3 -- Methods to evaluate crowdfunding Another point of intense discussion is how to evaluate c rowdfunding to categorize it. Since c rowdfunding , as described by Mollick (2014) , is and will in the future be studied and used by many di fferent areas, the methods to classify each model and each type are and will be even more diverse .", "The m ain problem in this topic is the lack of a standard method to classify all the types of crowdfunding ; in other words, the different types came to be using different metho ds, and there is no single method used to de scribe all of them at the same time. From the field of economics, c rowdfunding models could be cl assifi ed by the use of econometrics , with incentives being significant variables (Agrawal, Catalini, Goldfarb, 2013). From the near fi eld of finance , the parameters describing the models of crowdfunding could be the co mmunication to investors (Moritz, Block, Lutz, 2014) or the return to inve stors (Tomczak On a more qualitative view of the psyc hology fi eld, motivation could be the main parameter to define c rowdfunding types, one theory often used in the self -determination theory, according to it motivation could be intrins ic and extrinsic and has three i nnate needs that need to be satisf ied, competence, autonomy and relatedness (Ryan and Deci, 2000) . The literature does not provide a s mall consensus on how to ev aluate crowdfunding ; however , some themes are usua lly used. When studying the interaction between funders, platforms , and founder’s motivation and payoffs are recurring mechanisms, on a more quantitat ive study , returns, payoffs , and incentives are prevalent. In the following chapter , it will be clearer on how we will c lassify c rowdfunding models in this research.", "2.4 – Crowdfun ding, video -games , and e -sports Literature connecting crowdfunding and e -sports is scarce , and it is not significant to this study since the connection between c rowdfunding and the funding of e -sports tournaments has not been found studied before. However, c rowdfunding and video -games have a deeper and older connection , thus resulting in richer , but still scarce, literature. Some connections made by previous studies can be described as the newborn business model based on crowdfunding where video -game publishers are being substituted by crowdfunding (Thurner, K roenert, Goersch, 2019, Planells, 2015) , the advantages and disadvanta ges of using crowdfunding to devel op a video -game (Mollick & Kuppunswamy, 2014) and the shift in culture from being consumers to being investors (Planells, 2015) . Looking further in Thurner, K roenert, Goersch, 2019, it is stated that this shift in the market creates an environment where small developers, without the backing of big publisher s, experiencing a trial -and-error process with the life of the company depending on the success of a single product similar to a start-up environment.", "This environment created a surge of indie video -games developers and games ; as can be seen in the data extracted by Statista , the number of indie video -games on Steam more than doubled from 2015 to 2017 Clement (2020) . Corroborating with Planells, 2015, that conclude s that this environment is positive in creating an emancipatory framework for video -games developers.", "Also, in Planells, 2015, it is important to notice the development of a participatory culture among users , thus creatin g the inclusion of users in the development of the game , in the end, converting the consumer to a prosumer -investor.", "This result is vital to understand the key feature of user feedback and interaction in the following e -sports crowdfunding models.", "2.5 -- Crowdfunding and marketing Like the previous section, the literature that connects crowdfunding and marketing is limiting, but a relevant part of this literature displ ays crowdfunding as a marketing tool . Sayedi and Baghaie (2017) describe crowdfunding as a useful marketing and price discr imination tool. In their work , crowdfunding has effects on consumers ' habits and decisions and producers ' selling strategies, thus making it a marketing tool to boaster sa les using mechanisms like pre -selling and pre -ordering or induce funders to mis evaluated the true price of the product.", "An infamous case , portrayed by many news media like Forbes and the New York Times, of mis evaluat ion is the Star Cit izen project Lanier (2019), Perez & Vardi (2019), Gault (2018), Parker (2017) , a video -game that had millions funded by the crowd but did not deliver any of its promises .", "Another study by Brown, Boon , and Pitt (2016) portraits crowdfunding and as a marketing tool to boost brand image and to ensure market read iness to the future pipeline. The literature lacks when providing an accepted framework or how to implement crowdfunding as a tool for marketing.", "2.6 – Crowdfunding models operationalization In this section , it is displayed how the literature operationalized the different models of crowdfunding.", "In the case of reward -based crowdfunding, following Cumming, Leboeuf , and Scweinbacher (2019) , they divided the models into two distinct types, the Keep -it-All (KiA) model and the All -or-Nothing (AoN) model.", "With the KiA model consis ting of pledging for a determined amount for the completion of the project, but if the amount is not reached , the founder keeps all th e money that was possible to gather then, and the AoN being the opposite of the keep -it-all model, the founder will only keep the money gathered it the amount reaches and/or surpasses the amount pledged. It is also described that the big difference in thes e models is how the users view the project ; with the information being asymmetric , the choice of how to monetize the crowdfunding camping gives the user a signal o f how good the project is with the AoN model translating to a signal of good quality projects , meaning that “ entrepreneurs need to “have sufficient skin in the game” to convince the crowd as entrepreneurs .” The study created three hypotheses based on the likelihood of success of the crowdfunding campaign and the risk associated with each of the models presented. Data w ere extracted from the studies platform directly with closed campaigns from 2008 to October 2013 ; data from 2007 and November 2011 were excluded due to not being an option to select between the two models.", "Data analysis took from t wo methods, comparative histogram analysis from the completion ratio of the two models and a comparative analysis of risk (standard deviation) and return ed (mean) of each model .", "Differently from the previous study in Mollick (2014) consisted of manly as a n exploratory study . In this sense , no formal hypothesis w as formed. Mollick gathered data directly from the platform from 2009 to July 2012 and excluded extreme pledging values with thresholds being one hundred dollars minimum and one million maximum, also were excluded from the study non -us projects.", "The data was analyzed with a comparison between different categories of projects using descriptive data . The further analysis used the correlation between these variables. In the crowdlending section , two main distinctions were made the peer -to-peer lending described in Lin, Prabhala , and Viswanathan (2013) and person -to-business lending described by Maier (2016).", "In Lin, Prabhala , and Viswanathan (2012) , the effects of the online friendships of borrowe rs are the main point to signal credibility , thus affecting the success rate of the crowdlending, interest rates , and default rates. The model described is a simple loan from a person or a group of people to one individual , with the interest rate being the result of the lending.", "The data was gathered directly from the platform, from January 2007 to May 2008, using the platform`s API for borrowers (founders). The empirical model has one joint hypothesis based on social stigm a economic theories.", "The first model was divided in to six different specifications for the level of friendship ; afterward , a Probit model was estimated to test the probability of success of a listing. On the other hand, in Maier (2016) , the author propo ses a model where speed and flexibility are key points. He argues that instead of using the old financial system to gather resources , busines ses tend to use crowdlending platforms because they are more convenient. Like the previous model , the one described by Maier is a simple loan , with the main dependent variable being the decision of switching or not to crowdlending instead of traditional lending. The study divided the empirical analysis in to two steps, first the supply side (borrower requests) and the demand side (consumer investments). For the first part, based on the literature, eight hypotheses were created. Data was gathered directly from users of the platform focusing on SMEs by a survey , and the method of analysis consisted o f a partial least squared (PLS) model with Smart PLS 3 with the criterion used to assess validity being a heterotrait -monotrait ratio of correlations (HTMT).", "In the second part , six hypotheses were used with data be ing gathered in the same way as the first part , and the method used to analyze was simple regression.", "Figure 2 - Crowdfunding literature models 2.7 – Legal status of crowdfunding As expected from a recent phenomenon, crowdfunding legal status is still being debated in many countries in the world.", "From a report from the European Expert Network on Culture (EENC) entitled Crowdfunding Schemes in Europe by Röthler and Wenzlaff (2011) , crowdfunding should be treated by the proposed reward it gives: no reward, sponsorship, pre -selling, lending , and investments. To judge a crowdfunding campaign, it should be based on its results . In a no reward campaign, for example, the law applied shou ld be the same one applied in donation cases. The report, however, stated that more regulation regarding immaterial goods, such as patents and copyrights , is needed when applied to crowdfunding campaigns. Moving to the United States of America, the legal situation of crowdfunding is still a debate between a new form of regulation or fitting into the present securities regulation, as studied by Hornuf and Schwienbacher (2017). This state was a reversa l from the complete prohibition under the federal securit ies law in 2013 , as stated by Valanciene and Jegeleviciute", "3 – Methodology The theoretical research was divided in to three theoretical parts . The first theoretical part was the derivation and adaptation of the criterion used in the literature to categorize the different crowdfunding models. In this section , following Mollicks (2104) critic it is important to select a variety of criteri a to not exclude different points of vie w regarding crowdfunding.", "With this in mind , it is also important to use a criterion that is generally accepted in each field but not being t oo specific as too much specification will lead to the exclusion of crowdfunding types.", "Data source Collection Method Analysis Method Keep-it-all Platform Manual histogram/risk-return All-or-nothing Platform Manual histogram/risk-return Reward-based Platform Manual discriptive comparison/ variables correlation P2P Crowdlending Platform API Probit P2B Crowdlending Users Survey PLS/OLS Using the idea of a repres entative agent borrow from economics defined by Edgeworth (1881), the models used to represent each crowdfunding type will be a typical model and will not represent the complexity of the models made by previous scholars. The criteria were selected to brin g variety into the study as well as promote a common base in which all the crowdfunding models could be distinguished from each other. The following were th en selected: the payoffs parameters of the funders and founders from the fields of economics and fin ance, the motivation parameters derived from the self - determination theory on the field of psychology , and the marketing opportunities a new construct created based on the marketing literature related to crowdfunding on the field of marketing. After setting the criter ia that were used to classify the possible model s of crowdfunding , the case selection and analysis incurs.", "To select cases , two criteria needed to be filled, the amount of data that can be gathered and the presence of a possible crowdfunding model or mechanic inside the e -sport. For the first criteria , both first -person shooters and multiplayer online battle arena sub -genres w ere plausible. However, only the latter had examples of crowdfunding mechanics . Inside the sub -genre , the choices for cases were very limiting ; two criteria were applied to the selection. First , the e -sport needed to have an international tournament ; this is to reduce possible country demographics and cultur al bias as is stated in the literature that different cultures are more or less inclined to contribute. The second criterion was the visibility and popularity of the e -sport . This was needed to ensure re liable and open information, as popular e-sports have many different sources of information and also to ensure relevance to the study. The first criteria w ere fulfilled by four cases, League of Legends, Dota 2, SMITE , and Vain Glory, but the second criteria at first was fulfilled by only the first here of then, as Vain Glory had limitations caused by their multi -platform setting (iOS, And roid and PC) regarding data compatibility.", "The final theoretical part was then th e case analysis that resulted in a conceptualization of a new crowdfunding model present in the mentioned cases , called incentive -based crowdfunding . The modeling used the result s of the evaluation of the crowdfunding mechanics using the criteria developed in the first part to create basic relationships ; further ones were a result of the e -sports publisher mentioned relations, theoretical relations made by previous studies that fit the model , and theoretical relations expected in or derived from the model i tself. Empirical research w as divided in to two parts.", "Figure 3 – Data fluxogram The first part consisting of data gathering and cleansing for each of the cases selected. Of all the cases , only the Dota 2 case presented enough public data to be analyzed, with the other two cases (League of Legends and SMITE) data had to be requested from the developer but resulted in a negative response. Data regarding the number of users and number of Twit ch viewership was easily gathered from a website that uses official supported API that gathers information from the platform Steam, developed by Valve Corporation , that hosts the game Dota 2, other information was gathered from third -party news and reports with respectable sources like the official Dota 2 wiki page for incentive dates and unofficial tracking API website that tracked all of the tournaments prize pools increments. Regarding frequency , data was gathered at a daily frequency resulting in 733 ob servations .

To not exclude possible types, we need to select diverse methods from different fields of study.", "Following the literature, I have selected three parameters that are used in this research to classify a type of crowdfunding. They being: the payoffs of both the funders and the founders, the motivations behind funding , and the marketing opportunities in each type. Also, it is important to note that the results of these parameters were simplified versions of the true results since I u sed typical models and not developed derived models of each type. 4.1 -- The payoffs parameters To portrait the payoffs, let c be the absolute value of the contribution made by the individual, x the number of founders, f the final product monetary value, p the probability of success of the crowdfunded project , s the satisfaction or utility multiplayer and converter of altruism, r the interest rate , E the total amount of equity available and the amount pledged a. Also , let i be the identifier for each particular funder.", "4.1.1- The payoffs of f ounders The payoffs of founders will be the exact value that the founder received after the crowdfunding campaign. This payoff can be zero and can attain negative values in exceptional cases. These will not be portrayed since the only simple representative model will be displ ayed. 4.1.1.1 - Reward -based crowdfunding In this type of crowdfunding , we will describe four typical models. This decision is due to a possible future implication on the e -sports crowdfunding cases. The first two models mentioned KiA and AoN models. These models are repeated for the third and fourth models , with the difference being that the first use fixed amount contributions and then variable amount contributions, bath cases being possible to occur and be designed in real applications.", "Model 1 .1: KiA fixed contributions Payoff = Money gathered Money gathered = amount of funders*contribution Payoff = x*c Model 2 .1: AoN fixed contributions Payoff = Probability of success*Money gathered Payoff = p(x*c) Model 3 .1: KiA variable contribution Payoff = Money gathered Money gathered = sum of each particular contribution Payoff = ∑ 𝒄𝒊 Model 4 .1: AoN variable contribution Payoff = Probability of success*Money gathered Payoff = p * ∑ 𝒄𝒊 It is easy to see that the payoffs of the KiA model is usually be bigger since the probability of success in the AoN models are not 1. However, it is explained by Cumming, Leboeuf , and Schweinbacher (2019) that this may not be the case due to asymmetric information between founders and funders .", "4.1.1.2 – Donation -based crowdfunding Different from the previous type of crowdfunding, donation -based models can be simplified in just two variants of the same model, with both fixed and variable contributions. Model 5 .1: Donation fixed contribution Payoff = T otal amount contributed Total amount contributed = amount of funders*contribution Payoff = x*c Model 6 .1: Donation variable contribution Payoff = Total amount contributed The total amount contributed = sum of each particular contribution Payoff = ∑ 𝒄𝒊 It is no coincidence that the payoffs from the donation -based models are equal to the KiA reward -based crowdfunding . The y essentially are the same model of crowdfunding for the founder, with the only big difference the target audience (funder group) since the motives behind the two models are distinct.", "With this in mind, if we had just this parameter to evaluate the different types of crowdfunding, all the donation -based models would be misclassified as KiA reward -based models. Showing the importance of a multiple -sided approach to classify crowdfunding models. 4.1.1.3 – Crowdlending This type of crowdfunding requires attention when using this parameter. Since there is a large number of possible loan contracts to simply this in one contract is not possible, so to create the possible payoffs of this type , we need to understand two aspects of loans linked to the founders.", "The first is that there is no fraction loan, meaning that the amo unt pledged has to be fulfilled exactly, so it is not possible to apply the same strategy as the KiA model or to gather more than the pledged amount. The second is that crowdlending may not be successful as a loan since there are no collaterals or guarantees attached to the loan or a previously made financial profile of the founder. As a consequence , there is a risk factor for the founder of crowdlending. With these two aspects in mind and considering that this type of crowdfunding does not affect the development of this research, and does use the simplest loan possible. In this loan , there is a probability of success of gathering all the money needed , and the amount contributed by each funder is variable with the possibility of being just one funde r, thus creating a private loan contract.", "Model 7 .1: Loan variable contribution Payoff = Probability of success * amount pledged Amount pledged = sum of each particular contribution Payoff = p * ∑ 𝒄𝒊 4.1.1.4 – Equity -based crowdfunding Like crowdlending , this type of crowdfunding presents many possible real case scenarios. However, for the founder , it is as simple as selling part of his company. In this case , there are only two limitations that we need to impose on all possible models. The founder cannot sell the control of his company ; this limitation is put to stop the founder from committing fraud and another illegal trading since equity -based crowdfunding can be viewed as an open stock market. This condition s that the maximum amount gathered via crowdfunding be 50% -1 of the company.", "The other limitation is that there is no possibility to not receive the amount gathered . In other words, it is impossible not to be using a KiA strategy. This condition is important because the founder project /company will be viewed as a normal operating company ; in this case , the funders will view their contribution as buying stocks , so there is no return money. In the scenario in which the company does not receive the amount desired , it would be similar to declaring bankruptcy , thus granting funders rights on the company assets. With these t wo limitations in mind , we can design a ty pical simple model for equity - based crowdfunding.", "Model 8 .1: Equity -based variable contribution Payoff = Money gathered Money gathered = Sum of all individual contributions Payoff = ∑ 𝒄𝒊 4.1.2 -The payoffs of funders Analog to the payoffs of founders , the funders will receive what the founders promise, being products, services, money for future payments. In this scenario, negative payoffs are also possible , and the payoff of zero being not receiving what was promised and getting the contribution back.", "4.1.2.1 – Reward -based crowdfunding Using the same four models used prior in the type , there are few changes to be made to evaluate the payoffs for funders in reward -based models.", "The main change is that in both types of models (Kia and AoN) , the funder has a risk component attached to the contribution. In the keep -it-all model , the risk is more evident with the project no t being successful and the funder losing the amount contributed. On the all -or- nothing model , the risk is more subtle, the funder will not lose the amount contributed , but the risk of backing an unsuccessful project still exist s.", "In this sense , the payoffs need to reflect mainly the risk of success of the project. Model 1.2: KiA fixed contribution Payoff = Probability of success * Final product monetary value Payoff = p*f Model 2.2: AoN fixed contribution Payoff = Probability of success * Final product monetary value + (1 – Probability of success) * Contribution Payoff = p*f + (1 -p) *c Model 3.2: KiA variable contribution Payoff = Probability of success * Specific amount contributed Payoff = p*c i Model 4.2: AoN variable contribution Payoff = Probability of success * Final product monetary value + (1 – Probability of success) * Specific contribution Payoff = p*f + (1 -p) *ci On the opposite side of the founder’s risk, the funder share s risk in any model of reward - based crowdfunding. This characteristic is not explained by Cumming, Leboeuf , and Schweinbacher (2019), but one could argue that this is a result of asymmetric information leaving the risk factor implicit for the funders. This argument would only be valid if the platform or means form w hich the founder is pledging is not disclosing essential information that the final product would only be delivered if a certain funding threshold is met . This is also considering that funders do not know any crowdfunding mechanism or model . However, this scenario could constitute consumer rights violation s in many countries , thus rendering compensation a probable way out of the unknown risk. It is also hard to believe that funders would not know anything about crowdfunding before backing a project . In the end, the risk factor should be disclosed in the models presented, seeing the possible scenario for it not being present being very unlikely.", "4.1.2.2 – Donation -based crowdfunding Different from its founder counterpart, the funder payoff is not as simple to understand. Going back to the literature, the funder of donation -based projects has very subjective motives on backing them ; this subjecti vity causes issues when trying to give value to the amount of satisfaction one receives upon donating.", "To solve this, we borrow the economic concept of utility. This concept translates in to a unit, the unit of utility is subjective and based on each individual . As a result , each individual has his base of measurement.", "With this concept , we created the multiplier of utility s unique for each individual ; in the end , the payoff will not be displayed in monetary values like the other types of crowdfunding but units of utility . It is important to understand that these units can be translated ultimately in monetary values, but to do this , it is necessary to have the conversion rate each individual has for utility (with this being impossible).", "Model 5.2: Donation -based variable contribution Payoff = Unique utility multiplier and converter * Amount contributed Payoff = si *c 4.1.2.3 – Crowdlending In contrast to the founder’s payoff, the funder 's payoff is very simple to demonstrate . As said before in the literature review, backers will receive interest upon contribution. This interest rate is previously arranged and , in a simple case , is not modified or ha s no contractual conditions that can modify it.", "To simplify even further , we consider the nominal interest rate, meaning that the interest does not suffer from the effects of inflation ; also, the interest is a one-time payment at the end of the contract like a simple government bond.", "Model 6.2: Crowdlending variable contribution Payoff = Contribution * (1+ Interest rate) Payoff = c*(1+r) 4.1.2.4 – Equity -based crowdfunding Equity -based funder 's payoff is simple to represent. The only issue to be aware of is the first condition we put when explaining the founder’s payoff. The maximum amount a funder can receive in the form of stocks or participation in the company is 50% -1. It is also disregard ed future dividends since they are extremely uncertain and are a long - term goal.", "Model 7.2: Equity -based variable contribution Payoff = (Contribution/Maximum equity) % 4.2 – The motivations parameters Motivations are not certain , and unlike the donation -based funders ' payoff , it cannot be displayed in utility units. To further worsen the situation, motivations are numerous and hard to be classified.", "Instead of trying to understand motivations using the mentioned self -determination theory, I opt ed for a simpler way out . Like Kraus, Richter, Brem, Cheng , and Chang (2016) , motivations w ere divided in to two groups, material and immaterial. Material motivations will result in material compensations ; likewise , immaterial motivations will result in immaterial compensations.", "To exemplify what is considered material, in th ese groups are motivations like profits, money, products , and services. For immaterial , we can say altruism, guilt, recognition , and social rewards.", "4.2.1 – Reward -based crowdfunding As described in the literature review , reward -based crowdfunding can sustain both motivation groups for funders. Founders, on the other hand, will most likely fall on the material motivations since their projects will result in products o r services that will likely be profitable. Since there is a lot of subjectivi ty on this type of crowdfunding , it is expected that there is an exception on both funders and founders, so to give more objectiveness , exceptions , and outliers w ill be discarded .With this criterion , we can determine that motivations for funders are both immaterial and material , and founders are material.", "4.2.2 – Donation -based crowdfunding Also described in the literature review and with popular knowledge, donations are expected to be a selfless act with no material compensation for funders ; as for founders , the case is not as clear.", "Depending on the criteria founder’s motivations could be exclusively material or not. If it is believ ed that the goal of the crowdfunding campaign i s to buy products or finance labor to help others, we could consider this as an immaterial motivation since the end compensation is the help of others . On the other hand, with a more short -sighted view , the main objective of crowdfunding is to purchase goods or pay for labor, which is derived from material motivations. In a more objective way of looking at the problem, crowdfunding would only be possible if the founder had a material motivation . If not, there is no need for the funds to be raised. With this, the short -sighted view is favored and will be used as the parameter. In the end, the funder 's motivations are purely immaterial, and for founders , their immediate motivation to use crowdfunding is m aterial, even though their overall motivations are immaterial.", "4.2.3 – Crowdlending For crowdlending , motivations are very clear ; both funders and founders are materially motivated.", "A scenario could be made where funders are immaterially motivated, a scenario in which interest rates are below the market value ; this case funder would be subsidizing the credit for founders. As this is a very unlikely scenario, it is used the same criteria used in reward -based crowdfunding and st ipulate both purely material motivated.", "4.2.4 – Equity -based crowdfunding Despite being similar to crowdlending in motivation, equity -based crowdfunding has more acceptable cases of immaterial motivations.", "Undeniably founders will have exclusive material motivations ; this is clear when comparing it with the stock market. Companies go public to raise capital for their purposes , in equity -based crowdfunding is the same.", "For funders , there is a gray area similar to the start -up ecosystem . There are cases where an investor is altruistic , usually with companies that have purposes other than profits. This could be translated into the crowdfunding ecosystem; we cannot rule out cases in which funders are being altruistic and helping companies that support causes other than profit. This argument is comp elling enough to give reasonable doubt about the funder 's motivations. In this case , we have no choice to attribute then both material and immaterial ones. 4.3 – The marketing opportunities This concept of marketing opportunities in crowdfunding has not been developed and were adapted from both situations in which crowdfunding is used as a marketing tool. From the first situation, we have crowdfunding being a sales booster, misevalua te mechanism and futureproofing sales, and from the second , we got it as a way to increase brand image and also futureproofing sales.", "With this , we have four possible uses for crowdfunding in marketing: futureproof , misevalu ation , sales , and brand image booster . These are going to be the four possible cases of marketing opportunity. If in any model of crowdfunding , marketing is involved but is not inside these , it will not be considered a marketing opportunity. It will also be possible to have many iterations of the same opportunity in a model ; those are also counted, but without time as an influence ; in other words, the same opportunity is not to be counted twice if repeated by the same mechanism at two different time points.", "This definition is very narrow and will change in the future, but since there are so little researches linking crowdfunding and marketing , this is the best possible as of today. 4.3.1 – Reward -based crowdfunding To determine what are the possible marketing opportunities for both KiA and AoN models of reward -based crowdfunding , we need to trace the flow of information and then search for one of th e four possibilities inside this flow.", "Since both models are very direct and simple , their information flows will also be, for each information is generated at the founder side, descriptions of the project, development progress , and pledge amount are all available to funders. After this , funders will use this information to decide back or not the project.", "The information, however, is not all disclosed ; as said by Cumming, Leboeuf , and Schweinbacher (2019), information is asymmetric , and founders have much more information regarding their projects than it is disclosed to funders ; this asymmetry is the key point to determine marketing opportunities.", "In the KiA model , this asymmetry permit s the use of misleading information , creating a possibility of misevaluation by funders . Also, there is a way to increase brand image i f certain information i s not disclosed , thus rendering the KiA model two marketing opportunities. On the other hand, on the AoN model, as mentioned by Cumming, Leboeuf , and Schweinbac her (2019), the founder has a major advantage in boosting sales as his project is more believable than the KiA model. With this addition , the AoN model has three marketing opportunities.", "It is important to note that the opportunity of brand image is a pos sibility in both models, but considering that the majority of projects of this type are of unknown brands , the power of this marketing opportunity is diminished and non -relevant.", "4.3.2 – Donation -based Crowdfunding Similar to reward -based crowdfunding , the information flow for the donation -based models is straight forward . The founder has most of the information control and is its generator. The only main discrepancy is the regulation regarding institutions that would use this type of crowdfunding.", "In many countries , non-profit institutions that are financed via donations (including donation -based crowdfunding ) have specific regulations in what information they must disclose to donators. In a w ay, this can reduce the power over information but could be the opposite and enforce their power over it.", "If regulation reduces power , then the use of misleading information and the informational asymmetry is reduced ; in an extreme case where this power is nullified , there would be only one marketing opportunity of boosting the brand image. In the polar opposite case where power enforcement is absolute , then two marketing opportunities would be possible, boosting the brand image and misevaluation . It is arguable if boosting sales is possible or not in this scenario, and my view is that since sales are not derived by material compensation , the power of this marketing opportunity is very low , thus not being relevant.", "4.3.3- Crowdlending Following the simplicity of previous topics in this type of crowdfunding, crowdlending has only one point of interest regarding marketing opportunities , material compensation. This is the only information required by funders since it is n ot possible to provide collateral , guarantees , or a financial profile of the founder. In a way , this gives a lot of informational power to the founder, but it is of no use since there is only one piece of information of importance , and it is compulsory to reve al it.", "Like the economic rule of higher interest rates being more attractive to capital, the higher the interest rate offered in crowdlending , the higher the attractiveness of the loan , thus being the sole marketing opportunit y of sales -boosting.", "4.3.4 – Equity -based crowdfunding The base that makes this type of work is the same that makes the stock market work, information is paramount to investors , and the more it is disclosed , the more investors will be interested in it.", "The information , like all the other types , is generated by the founders, but in this case, there is an incentive to disclose it. This movement lead s to a boost in sales and possibly brand image , depend ing on the case, but it will also nullify the possibility of misevaluation . In the end, usually , the gain in sales compensates for the loss of misevaluation . This is confirmed by the amount of information that equity -based founders disclose.", "5 -- The e -sport s cases E-sports are a recent phenomenon, professionally played dating back to the early 2000s, but they bec ame a big hit when the MOBA`s arrived.", "MOBA is the abbreviation for multiplayer online battle arena and is a subgenre of the real-time strategy (RTS) video -games. They require the player to have fast reactions, high adaptability , deep knowledge of the game mechanics , and strategic thinking. The genre had its origin as a custom map for the original Star Craft called Aeon of Strife (AoS) Minotti (2014) ; in this first iteration , the map was played by only four human players that took control of a powerful unit to compete with an opposing computer. The map evolved and took form in another custom map in 2003, this time in Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos and its expansion Warcraft III: Frozen Throne, called Defense of the Ancients (DotA). This custom map defined the basics of modern MOBA`s and was the first to promote tournaments.", "After many years and the aging DotA map, in 2009 , two former business students, Brandon “Ryze” Beck and Marc” Tryndamere ” Merill , along with a former DotA developer Steve “Guinsoo” Feak , created League of Legends (LoL).

Units called champions we not all unlocked for free, and people had to either play for a long time or pay to unlock the m; also, cosmetic items, which are items that do not affect gameplay but only the appearance of the game, were sold in the in -game st ore. Soon after de success of LoL , a competitor called Heroes of Newerth (HoN) Minotti (2014) was launched ; this time , along with microtransactions , the game was in beta purchasable and became free -to-play two years after.

In this case , the amount of utility gained by altruism is linearly related to the amount contributed ; in other words, the effects of the utility gain will not be dependent on what type of altruism since we are considering only one aggregate of all types.

This topic is still a fierce battlefield in the literature ; following Mollick`s (2014) critique and definition , the definition used in this study was made broad enough to encapsulate all the well -established crowdfunding models but narrow enough to not include false models. It also contributed by incorporating the self-determination theory in the definition , making it plausible for use in all areas that traditionally study crowdfunding. This inclusion also developed the self - determination theory as it is not being used to derive a definition but is part of a previo usly made definition.", "The second contribution was a possible solution for the debate in the literature re garding which tool to be used to evaluate crowdfunding models. The tools developed in this study were taken f rom the various areas of crowdfunding lit erature, from finance and economics with payoffs, t hrough psychology with motives and marketing with a new construct called marketing opportunities. They were made with the intention of broad use and shallow understanding to create the possibility of a generalized use for categorization but not suitable for deep study. The last contribution is the new crowdfunding model itself, as its discovery and proposition w as a clear gap in the infant literature. I ts proposition is now entangled with the business models used by each of the cases studied , thus making it not being a pure ly theoretical model providing a further gap in the literature .", "Following the analytical part of the study , two main conclusions were drawn. First, all of the hypotheses as stated were confirmed for the Dota 2 case . The presence of incentives, amount of visibility , and variation of players , positively influence the variation of the prize pool. As for the player hypotheses , the presence of incentives and visibility do increase the number of players in the game. Finally, for the visibility regression, the presence of a tournament greatly increases visibility, with visibility itself, the presence of incentives , and the prize pool moderately influencing t he visibility.", "Second, however, failing expectations , the relationship between the incentive variable and the variation of players is static , meaning that only the first lag of the incentive influences the variation in the number of players. The theory beh ind the model would put that the incentive would present more lags since it is not plausible that all the players enter the game to purchase the incentive on the following day it is released. The same effect is also counter -intuitive when looking at the re lationship between the incentive and the variation of the prize pool. There is also a managerial takeaway. All three models presented are the same, varying in complexity. The more complex model should be used in situations that have high user data availab ility to create optimal incentives as well as enough budget to make all the engines inside it work ; the least complex model , on the other hand , should be used in the opposite situation when there is little to no information available and not enough budget. Regarding theoretical profitability , the more incentives present , the more profitable the model is; however, execution is, in practice , a source of great variability.", "It worth noting that analytical results are specific to one particular case due to data availability and the choice of criteria to select cases , thus creating a huge gap in the literature regarding the model proposed.", "9 – Topic s for debate This research has many possible points to be debated.", "From a theoretical perspective , the whole conciliation of crowdfunding categorization is still a debate in the area and should be questioned if the tool created in this research is proper or complete.", "Linked to it , the existence of the new incentive base crowdfunding category opens the debate of it being a crowdfunding model or a sales model with a crowdfunding side -effect. This is mainly a derivative of the definition of crowdfunding debate in the are a, as there is no well - accepted definition ; every crowdfunding model can be questioned if it is or not crowdfunding. Another possible debate regarding the new model is the distinction it has from the reward -based crowdfunding model; one could argue that th e incentive -based model is just a sequence of reward -based ones.", "Looking at the analytical part, its fragility and the methodology applied could be questioned. As it was made as simple as possible to facilitate understanding and to reduce problems inherit from more complex analytical methods, it may not be the best one to validate the new model.", "10 – Further research Given the criticism of this research , further research could be made to fill the gaps and deepen this research.", "The theoretical part could be studied in depth with more crowdfunding categorization tools being studied and integrated in to the tool develop ed in this research, and also, the theoretical model derived from the cases could be improved by using other cases not confined in the e -sports scenario .", "The same could be done for validation of the model by using more diverse data gathered outside this scenario. Another point in the analytica l section is the future diversity of methodology that could be applied to confirm or deny the validation present in this research.", "11 – References", "https://www.reuters.com/article/esports -business -gaming -revenues/report -gaming -revenue - to-top-159b -in-2020 -idUSFLM8jkJMl; https://www.businessinsider.com/video -game - industry -120-billion -future -innovation -2019 -9; https://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/wiki/Summoner_spell Aaker, J., & Akutsu, S.

Introdu ction", "Given sustainability and circular economy principles having increasing importance in the global economy, throughout the most diverse range of industrial or non -industrial processes, deeper research and investments are being geared towards improving the bet ter usage of natural sources, energy and raw materials . In this context, Membrane Distillation is brought as a solution to face major grand challenges in the twenty -first century: to combat the growing scarcity of regional freshwater and to provide a susta inable treatment for one of the world’s heaviest burden, which is processes wastewater (AMY et al., 2017; XIE et al., 2016) . The accessibility to fresh water is currently recognized as a global issue of strategic relevance, as water resources are unable to meet the ever -increasing demands from the industrial, domestic, agricultural and eco -environmental sectors (LIU et al., 2018a) . Nonetheless, once water is one of the most abundant chemical compounds on the Earth, and that almost half of the world's population lives within 100 km of an ocean, seawater – with an estimated amount of 96.7% of the total available water on Earth – represents a virtually infinite water resource (AMY et al., 2017; POLITANO et al., 2017) . Therefore, sustainable and innovative seawater desalination technologies, also aimed at energy recovery (such as waste heat utilization), have found to be, since over a decade ago, potential ways to reduce the stress on the existing water and energy sources causing minimal impact to the environment, p roviding an economically and ecological way to produce drinkable water (GUDE; NIRMALAKHANDAN; DENG, 2010; POLITANO et al., 2017) .", "The worldwide capacity for desalination projects incr eased dramatically from 326 m3 per day in 1945 to more than 95.6 million m3 per day in 2016 and, among the existing desalination technologies, Reverse Osmosis – or Seawater Reverse Osmosis (SWRO) – membrane technology accounts for 66% of the capacity utilized, followed by multi -stage flash and multi - effect distillation with 20% a nd 7% of the capacity utilized, respectively (MEHRGAN et al., 2020) . In recent years, MD has emerged either as a promising alternative or as a complement to SWRO, not being limited by osmotic phenomena and having the potential to produce desalted water at recovery factors higher than 85% (POLITANO et al., 2017) . Membrane Distillation (MD) is a membrane technology that not only presents the capacity to treat highly saline water, including indust rial wastewater, seawater, brine water from other processes, and oil -gas field produced water (YAO et al., 2020) , but can also be used in the food", "industry and on the production of chemical products (ASHOOR et al., 2016) . While thermal desalination technologies exist (such as Multi -Stage Flash and Multi -Effect Distillation), interest has turned to membrane -based technologies because of more favourable energetics – i.e., lower specific en ergy consumption ( kWh/m3) –, while Seawater Reverse Osmosis, a technology with associated greenhouse gas emissions and other environmental impacts, is still presently considered as the conventional technology (AMY et al., 2017) .", "MD is both a thermal and a membrane technology, based on the use of microporous hydrophobic membranes put in contact with a heated aqueous solution on the feed side and a cooled aqueous solution on the product (distillate) side. There are four different types of MD that differ in two ways: 1) the way in which the vapour pressure gradient is maintained and 2) the condensation method of the permeate vapou r (ASHOOR et al., 2016) . In principle, non - volatile solutes, such as macromolecules and ions, are completely rejected once the hydro - repellent nature of the membrane prevents the liquid passage through its pores, while mass transfer takes place only in vapour phase (POLITANO et al., 2017) .", "The typical feed temperatures for MD processes may vary in the range of 47℃ – 77℃ , which allows the use of renewable sources and the efficient recycle of waste heat, also called lower grade heat, often rejected to the environment (AL-OBAIDANI et al., 2008) . Therefore, the MD process can b e applied to optimize process engineering in the use these waste heat sources – with temperatures usually too low to produce electricity – because, although high - grade thermal energy is typically recovered within processes, thermal energy loss in industry is a significant matter due to the high temperatures and multiple heat intensive processes involved (AMMAR et al., 2012) .", "A significant example of process energy loss can be observed on thermoelectric power industries. In Brazil, more specifically in the country’s northeast area, the typical warm and dry weather are unfavourable conditions for hydroelectric plant reservoirs, major nationa l’s energy source. The water scarcity scenario in this area has been observed for about six years, with the fourth worst rainy period (December to April) in 2018, and the third worst dry period (May to September) in 2019. Hence, in order to avoid a sharp r eduction on the level of hydroelectric plant reservoirs during the drier months of the year, the Brazilian Ministry of Mines and Energy (MME) has published an authorization to operate gas thermoelectric power plants, on an exceptional and temporary basis (Agência Brasil ; Diário do Comérci o, 2018 ). In view of this situation, the Central Geradora Termelétrica Fortaleza (CGTF) is very relevant for energy", "operations security of the Sistema Interligado Nacional (or National Interconnected System) – national hydrothermal system responsible for the production and transmission of electricity (Sistema Interligado Nacional , 2021 ). The CGTF is a company from Enel Group, one of the largest energy corporations in the world , which supplies to more than 60 million residential and corporate customers in 40 countries (MIL, 2013) .", "In this study, a Membrane Distillation Pilot Plant (MDPP) to be an integrated part of CGTF operations, engineered and built in Brazil, was tested for efficiency in producing distillate water, given parameters such as streams temperatures, flow rate and distillate productivity. The tests were carried out by using imported commercial Membrane Modules (MM), as well as MM from national manufacture r, both with similar effective filtration area , on the treatment of Guanabara’s Bay Water .", "1.1. Objectives", "The main objective of this dissertation is to make an experimental and technical evaluation of Membrane Distillation (MD) technology , applied on the desalination of synthetic saline solution and of brackish water , from Rio de Janeiro’s Guanabara’s Bay . As well as to increase recovery and use of saline water by optimizing operations in a pilot scale plant . The specific goals of this work consist of: • Assessing MD performance as function of process variables, such as salinity, feed / distillated temperatures and flow rates, water recovery and membrane characteristics.", "• Evaluat ing the technical possibilities and advantages to increase water recovery through the inte gration of MD with other membrane processes, such as micro filtration.", "2. Literature Review", "2.1. Membrane Separation Processes", "Separation processes can be generally divided in two main groups: physical separation and chemical separation processes. Differences in chemical or physical properties such as size, shape, mass, density, or chemical affinity between the constituents of a mixture are some of the driving keys on separation processes, that are often classified according to the particular variances they use, and frequently implemented as a combination of multiple operations to achieve the desired separation (SEGOVIA -HERNANDEZ, 2016) .", "From the unit operations available for homogeneous gas and liquid separations, which are traditionally performed based on a phase change such as distillation, evaporation and condensation, membrane processes are usually considered to offer very promising performances in terms of energy efficiency for industrial separations and on the treatment of waste water and production of drinking water (CASTEL; FAVRE, 2018) . Membrane techniques have been successfully used in the separation of liquid and gas systems throughout many years (WIESZCZYCKA; STASZAK, 2017) , with primary motivation for membrane separation processes originating from the observation of natural biological systems, where most of the chemical engineering processes takes place – such as in the human body and all of its cells, encapsulated within semipermeable membranes (JHAVERI; MUR THY, 2016) . A schematic representation of recent membrane processes is shown on Figure 2.1.", "Considered to be one of the key technologies for gas separation applications, together with cryogenic distillation, adsorption and absorption processes, membrane processes are also highly applied for O 2/N2, H2/CO 2 and CO 2 separation, especially for post combustion processes, biogas upgrading and natural gas carbon dioxide removal (CASTEL et al., 2018; XU et al., 2018) . Membrane contactors operate similarly to MD and is considered one of the most promising technologies for CO 2 capture from flue gas, presenting the benefits of membrane processes, including simplicity of operation, modular construction, small footprint, and no hazardous by - product emissions, and is a potential resource to mitigate the climate chan ge caused by CO 2 emissions (XU et al., 2018) .", "Figure 2. 1 – Schematic representation of membrane processes , adapted (JHAVERI; MURTHY, 2016) .", "Membrane Distillation (MD) yields highly purified permeate by separating contaminants from liquid solutions, in particular, the MD process can be used as a substitute for conventional desalination processes such as Multi -Stage Flash (MSF), Reverse Osmosis (RO), and Multiple Effect Distillation (MED). The advantages of MD compared to these processes count for (AL- OBAIDANI et al., 2008) :", "(i) lower operating temperatures and vapour space required than MSF and MED. (ii) lower operating pressure than RO.", "(iii) 100% (theoretical) rejection of non -volatile solut e.", "(iv) performance not limited by high osmotic pressure or concentration polarization. Apart from its rapidly increasing use for the desalination of highly saline feed water, the MD is gradually becoming a preferred technology for produced water treatment and similar usages, especially when coupled with solar energy or utilizing low -grade he at source (AL- OBAIDANI et al., 2008; ASHOOR et al., 2016) .", "Membrane TechnologyNon-Equilibrium based Pressure -driven membrane processesMicrofiltration, Ultrafiltration, Nanofiltration, Reverse Osmosis, Pervaporation, Gas Permeation Non-Equilibrium based Non-Pressure driven membrane processes Dialysis, Electrodialysis Equilibrium based Non-Pressure driven membrane processes Forward osmosis, Liquid membranes Equilibrium based Thermally driven membrane processesMembrane Distillation", "2.2. Current Membrane Distillation applications", "Membrane Distillation is a thermal process driven by a vapour pressure gradient between a hot feed stream and a cold permeate (distillate) stream. A hydrophobic, microporous membrane serves as a medium for (water) vapour transport but a barrier to liquid p enetration, thus allowing separation of volatile (i.e., water) and non -volatile species (i.e., salts) (BOO; LEE; ELIMELECH, 2016) .", "MD was first introduced in the 1960s, but only later in the 1980s a new estimation of the temperature polarization effect allowed a better understanding of the heat and mass transfer resistances. It encouraged new applications of the process, beforehand co nsidered unfavourable due to economic purposes and an estimated low temperature polarization coefficient (ASHOOR Desalination by MD, in comparison with other separations processes , presents several advantag es, such as high rates of rejection for non -volatile components. For instance, Haneen, A. et.al. report the use of MD as an attractive separation process for wastewater treatment, achieving 95.6% salt rejection rates using highly saline feed (approximately 75 g/L) in a DCMD pilot unit, running with commercial polyethylene membranes, using fixed operating conditions for feed inlet temperature of 70oC, distillate inlet temperature of 20oC, with flowrates of 70 L/h for both streams (ABDELRAZEQ; KHRAISHEH; HASSAN, 2022) . Although, due to the continuous contact between hot feed, membrane and the permeate cold side, DCMD’s comparatively large conductive heat losses in contrast to other configurations results in relatively low thermal efficiency, it present other benefits that make its use appealing, such as (BOO; LEE; ELIMELECH, 2016; ZHANG et al., 2010) ; • necessity of lower operating pressure than pressure -driven membrane processes , • much larger membrane pore size than needed for Reverse Osmosis (RO) , • less sensitivity to fouling than RO , • reduced vapour space compared to conventional distillation , • low sensitivity to feed salinity and • low feed temperature requirements (40 -80°C) – which makes it possible to use low - grade heat as the energy source for separation.", "Among unit operations, membrane technology is gaining great importance in many of the industrial sectors like food, medicine, pharmacy, biotechnology, industrial effluent and waste water treatment, chemicals and it has also reached the domestic sector in the form of drinking water purification units (JHAVERI; MURTHY, 2016) . Membrane Distillation has potential applications in many areas of scientific and industrial interest, yielding highly purified per meate and separating contaminants from gaseous and liquid solutions, and it has been successfully tested in the treatment of thermally sensitive industrial products such as concentrating aqueous solution in fruit juices, in pharmaceutical industry and wate r desalination (AL-OBAIDANI et MD, initially designed as an alternative to Reverse Osmosis and thermal processes for desalination purposes, is also a compelling alternative to other treatment methods like the traditional distillation process, air stripping, bioreactors, anaerobic/aerobi c biological treatment and advanced oxidation process, to recover valuable materials (TAI et al., 2019) .Membrane Distillation has been reported in lit erature with successful application in the following processes:", "• Desalination – MD, originally designed for seawater desalination motivated by the continuous decrease of water availability for human consumption, due to quick industrialization and populati on growth, has gradually attracted interests from both academia and industry. Currently, the majority of the MD desalination applications are still limited in the laboratory or small pilot scales studies but, in 2014, the first commercial MD desalination p lant in the world started running in the Maldives. This desalination plant utilizes the waste heat produced by a local power plant to produce clean drinking water with the capacity of up to p to 10,000 L/day (TAI et al., 2019; WANG; CHUNG, 20 15).", "• Biofuels purification (Ethanol) – applied in the final stage of a fermentative production (using Saccharomyces cerevisiae) of ethanol from renewable sugarcane juice, MD increases product purity and results in significant concentration enrichment. The system, including a bench scale fermenter integrated with microfiltration, nanofiltration and membrane distillation units, enables continuous product withdrawal, separation and recycle of the biomass as well as residual carbon source back to the ferme nter under high cell density without product inhibition, as well as it", "is a green and sustainable process for a biofuel production, making use of solar energy for heating and vaporizing ethanol in the system (KUMAR; GHOSH; PAL, 2017) .", "• Removal of Heavy Metals – Due to the significant presence of heavy metal (such as Arsenic) in water and its substantial toxic effects to living beings, it has encouraged the development of a variety of heavy metals removal techniques, including ion exchange, adsorption, chemical coagulation -precipitation, and membrane process. Among those, MD has been applied successfully in treating water containing heavy metals such as arsenic and lead, being the only process feasible to treat supply waters with high salinity, dismissing the use chemicals, ecological friendly and sufficient to treat supply stream with a high concentration of metals (TAI et al., 2019) .", "• Concentration or Recovery of Valuable Materials – Food industry, likewise cosm etic and pharmacy industries, can take benefits from Membrane Distillation technology. Either used in the concentration of fruit juices, sugar, alcohol, herbal extracts or small organic molecules, the MD processing of these materials cause little to no effect on sensorial and active attributes; the low operating temperature (between 30 and 80 °C) of MD process makes it suitable for separation of thermally sensitive materials, therefore preventing the reduction of nutrient content – i.e. antioxidant and phenolic compounds – due to the excessive heat treatment during evaporation processes (JULIAN et al., 2020; WANG; CHUNG, 2015) .", "In general, membranes materials vary according to its chemical composition (organic or inorganic), physical structure (symmetric or asymmetric), charged or uncharged type – ion- exchange membranes have ionic permselectivity and are classified into cation -exchange membranes or anion -exchange membranes – and its mechanism of separation – solubility - diffusion and sieving, through dense or porous membrane (WIESZCZYCKA; STASZAK, 2017) . Dense membranes are characterized as the following definition:", "“Dense membranes consist of dense structure presenting no detectable pore at the limits of electron microscopy. A mixture of molecules is transported through dense membranes by diffusion under the driving force of a pressure, concentration, or electrical p otential gradient. Dense membranes may have a symmetric or an asymmetric structure. The first type has a uniform composition and structure over the entire cross section, and the thickness of the entire membrane determines the flux. These types of membranes are also named homogeneous (dense) membranes. The asymmetric membrane consists of", "thin and dense selective layer (skin) supported on a much thicker microporous support layer that provides mechanical support.” (BAZZARELLI; GIORNO; PIACENTINI, 2016) .", "One of the criteria for achieving efficiency on applying membrane distillation technology is to choose a suitable membrane that, above all, should be stable at operating temperatures of the process and resist to chemical attack by the solution components (ASHOOR et al., 2016; WIESZCZYCKA; STASZAK, 2017) . From the materials investigated or utilized for MD membranes, hydrophobic polymers are preferred due to their characteristics of easy fabrication, modification, and scale -up as well as low cost (CURCIO; DRIOLI, 2005) . Hydrophobicity i s one of the essential requirements for MD membranes in most applications ; therefore, membranes must be made from intrinsic or modified hydrophobic polymers with low surface energy. Characteristics such as surface energy (related to wetting resistance), th ermal conductivity, chemical stability and fabrication methods (influence on pores size) are essential to be investigated in order to produce MD membranes with high performance, sufficient wetting resistance and minimized fouling/scaling tendency (WANG; Several membranes have recently been designed, fabricated, and tested for process performance, with its material chosen depending on the specific application. Between the materials applied in the production of membranes aiming Direct Contact Membrane Disti llation (DCMD) process, polymers such as Polypropylene (PP), Polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), Polysulfone (PSf), and Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) are the most commonly used (ASHOOR et al., 2016) .", "According to Khayet (KHAYET, 2011) , the following membrane requirements are necessary for an effective MD application:", "a) At least one layer, from a single or multi -layers, being hydrophobic.", "b) The pore size ranging from several nanometers to a few micrometers with a narrow distribution desired and high liquid entry pressure.", "c) Small tortuosity factor ( i.e., measure of the deviation of the pore structure from straight cylindrical pores normal to the surface ).", "d) Higher porosity of the hydrophobic layer as possible.", "e) An optimum thickness so as maximise mass transport and minimise heat loss through the membrane material.", "f) Low thermal conductivity as possible.", "g) The surface in contact with the feed solution should be highly resistant to fouling.", "h) Good thermal stability for long term application for mixtures of up to 100 °C", "i) Excellent chemical resistance to various feed solutions as well as acidic and basic cleaning solutions.", "j) Ability to provide stable MD performance and long life.", "In the late 1960s, when membrane distillation technology was developed, membranes had very po or performance, which discouraged its commercially employment for many years. In the 1980s, membranes with improved characteristics became available, and MD research interests rose again, leading to the availability of even improved technological character istics (ZHANG et al., 2010) .

Membrane Distillation and Wetting Phenomena", "Membrane wetting is normally defined as liquid contacting with a solid membrane surface through intermolecular interaction between the phases of gas, liquid, and solid; it specifically sees liquids penetrating the pores of the membrane (YAO et al., 2020) . As a result, the flux either declines (blockage du e to partial pore wetting) or steeply rises (liquid transport due to complete wetting), while salt rejection keeps decreasing sharply. This wetting phenomenon is unique to MD since phase change is necessary, (i.e., formation of water vapour) rather than al lowing liquid water to penetrate through the membrane (ASHOOR et al., 2016; As previously stated, the selection of the membrane is the most crucial factor in MD separation performance. The membrane must be hydrophobic and porous and there are various types of membranes meeting these expectations; however the efficiency of a given MD application depends largely on additional factors such as resistance to mass transfer, thermal stability, thermal conductivity, module characterization and wetting phenomena (ONSEKIZOGLU, 2012) .", "There are essentially three factors that should be considered in order to avoid membrane wettability (ONSEKIZOGLU, 2012; YAO et al., 2020) ; • Pore size – As determined by Knudsen model, the permeate flux increases with the increase in pore size, which, for MD processes should range between 10 nm and l µm . However, in order to avoid wettability, small pore size should be chosen (ONSEKIZOGLU, 2012) . High salt rejections were achieved with membrane pore size of 0.2 mm and 0.45 mm (ALSEBAEAI; A HMAD, 2020) .", "• Contact Angle – The contact angle provides information about relative wettability of membranes. It is determined as the angle between the surface of the wetted solid and a line tangent to the curved surface of the drop at the point of thre e-phase contact (Figure 2.3) (ONSEKIZOGLU, 2012) . The value of contact angle is greater than 90° when there is low affinity between liquid and solid; the wettability of a solid surface by a liquid decreases as the contact angle increases (ALSEBAEAI; AHMAD, 2020) .", "Figure 2. 3 – Schematic representation of contact angle. Source: (ONSEKIZOGLU, 2012) .", "• Liquid Entry Pressure (LEP) – The hydrophobic nature of membranes in MD prevents the penetration of aqueous solutions into the pores unless a critical penetration pressure is exceeded. LEP is the minimum transmembrane hydrostatic pressure that must be applied before liquid solutions penetrate into the membrane pores. LEP can be calculated using the Laplace -Young equation (2.4) (ONSEKIZOGLU, 2012; ZHANG", "where 𝑃𝑓 and 𝑃𝐷 are the hydraulic pressure of the feed and distillate side, respectively. Laplace -Young equation of LEP indicates its dependency on membrane characteristics. Accordingly, LEP is inversely related to the largest pore radius (𝑟𝑚𝑎𝑥), and is directly related to the geometric factor (𝐵), the liquid surface tension (𝛾𝐿), and the cosi ne of liquid –solid contact angle (𝜃); thus it increases with a decrease in maximum pore size at the surface and an increase at the hydrophobicity (i.e., large water contact angle) of the membrane material (ALSEBAEAI; AHMAD, 2020; ONSEKIZOGLU, 2012) . The presence of strong surfactants or organic solvents such as oils or alcohols, can greatly reduce the liq uid surface tension thereby compromising water permeability and salt selectivity of the MD membrane (BOO; LEE; ELIMELECH, 2016) . For that reason, the use of pre -treatments like other filtration meth ods (UF or RO, in example) are some of the usual precautions to inhibit contamination of process solutions with detergents or other surfactant agents (ONSEKIZOGLU, 2012) .", "2.4. Fundamentals of Direct Contact Membrane Distillation (DCMD)", "Heat transfer and mass transfer are key mechanisms in DCMD, consequently, in order to identify features of membranes that could enhance MD performance, these mechanisms must be described (ZHANG et al., 2010) . A Heat and mass transfer scheme from DCMD process is shown in Figure 2.2. The feed (hot solution) is in direct contact with one side of a hydrophobic membrane surfac e and its temperature (T f,in) drops across the boundary layer on the feed side to T fm. The permeate (the cold solution) is in direct contact with the back side of the membrane, and its temperature T bp increases across the permeate boundary layer to T pm. The vapour pressure gradient is led and depends on the difference in the temperatures between both sides of the membrane, T fm and T pm, and the driving force to the separation process is, therefore, P(T fm) –P(T pm), where P(T fm) and P(T pm) are the vapour press ures at T fm and T pm, respectively. This induces the transport of vapor from one side of the membrane to the other, through the membrane pores. The feed concentration C bf increases across the feed boundary layer to C fm, once the nearer the solution is to th e membrane on the hot side, the more saturated – poorer in water – it is (ALSEBAEAI; AHMAD, 2020) .", "Figure 2. 4 – Schematic representation of a DCMD configuration, where water crosses the membrane surface in the feed side as H 2O vapour then condensates at the membrane distillate side. Hot feed water is passed on feed side (Region 1) of a hydrophobic membrane (Region 2), while cold water flows on permeate side (Region 3) to directly condense vapour that passes thro ugh the membrane . Source: (OLATUNJI; CAMACHO, 2018) .", "The vapour collected at the other side of the membrane is then condensed as a pure liquid product once, as mentioned earlier, the hydrophobic membranes only allows the passage of vapours. This consequently leads to the accumulation of the non -volatile solutes at the membrane surface facing the feed side which, in the long run, makes the concentration of the non-volatile solute at the membrane surface surpass that of the bulk supply, leading to concentration polarization. The formation of concentration polarization layer at the feed side suppresses the vapour transport, reducing the permeate flux (EL-BOURAWI et al., 2006; TAI et al., 2019) . The mass transfer resistance exerted by the concentration polarization la yer at the feed side can be determined using the Concentration Polarization Coefficient (CPC), determined as the ratio of the solute concentration at the membrane surface (C fm) to that at the bulk feed solution (C bf), as shown on equation (2.1) (ONSEKIZOGLU, 2012) ; 𝐶𝑃𝐶 =𝐶𝑓𝑚 The same phenomenon also occurs at the membrane surface facing the permeate side, due to the decrease in solute concentration as a result from the condensation of vapour on the permeate side. Fortunately, in MD process, the low to moderate flow rates and h igh heat transfer coefficients reduce its impact, which is also lower than the temperature polarization effect (EL- BOURAWI et al., 2006) .", "The mass transport mechanism is ruled by three basic mechanisms: Knudsen -diffusion (K), Poiseuille -flow (P), Molecular -diffusion (M) or the combinations between them, known as transition mechanism. The mass transfer resistance employed by the collisions of vapour molecules with pore walls (Knudsen resistance), collisions among the vapour molecules and/or with the air molecules trapped in the pores (molecular resistance), and transfer of momentum through the pores (viscous flow). Nevertheless which mechanism is involved in the mass transportation process, the models suggest that the molar flux, N, is proportional to the vapour pressure difference across the membrane – equation (2.2) (EL-BOURAWI et al., 2006; KHAYET, 2011; OLATUNJI; CAMACHO, 2018; TAI et al., 2019) .", "Where C is the membrane distillation coefficient that can be obtained experimentally and the vapour pressures P fm(Tfm) and P pm(Tpm) are functions of temperature at both the feed and permeate at the membrane surface, respectively (EL-BOURAWI et al., 2006) . In MD, the heat transfer happens alongside with the mass transfer, for in this thermally driven process a significant amount of heat energy is suppli ed to vaporize the liquid at the membrane surface, facing the feed side. This creates a heat transfer boundary layer at that membrane surface, which imposes higher resistance to heat transfer. Thus, due to the lowering of temperature as the feed moves from the feed stream through the membrane to the permeate stream, as a result of temperature polarization, the driving force of heat transfer is negatively affected (ASHOOR et al., 2016; OLATUNJI; CAMACHO, 2018; TAI et al., 2019) . This phenomenon is known as temperature polarization – a phenomenon intrinsically related to the removal of latent heat associated with water evaporation, causing the decrease of the temperature at the membrane surface with respect to its bulk value. As a consequence, the net driving force to the mass transport decreases, leading to the overall fall down of the process efficiency drastically. The same effect also occurs at the membrane facing the permeate side, which has the higher temperature than that o f the bulk permeate (POLITANO et al., 2017) . The temperature polarization coefficient (TPC) is gen erally expressed as the ratio of the difference between membrane surface temperature at feed (T fm) and permeate (T pm) sides, and the difference between bulk feed (T bf) and bulk permeate (T bp), as presented on equation (2.2). This coefficient represents the loss of the thermal driving force given thermal boundary layer resistances (CURCIO; DRIOLI, 2005; EL -BOURAWI et al., 2006; KHAYET, 2011) .", "TPC, often used as indirect index of efficiency for MD process, falls between 0.4 and 0.7 for a satisfying design of the system (CURCIO; DRIOLI, 2005; KHAYET, 2011) .", "This means that between 30% and 60% of the applied temperature difference is dissipated in the thermal boundary layers, with heat transfers across the membrane occurring through two different modes, namely latent heat of vaporization and conduction. The po rtion of heat transferred by conduction through the membrane matrix and the pore occupied with gas are considered as heat loss. In order to improve the MD process efficiency, it is necessary to", "minimize the convective heat loss, hence to lower the effects of temperature polarization (EL- BOURAWI et al., 2006; KHAYET, 2011; TAI et al., 2019) .", "The improvement of the TPC was observed to take place wi th the increase of both the feed and permeate flow rates, with a decrease of the temperature, especially the feed temperature. TPC is also strongly dependent on membrane characteristics, in such a manner that, by applying thin membranes with low thermal co nductivity and adding gases such as air and vapour with much lower thermal conductivity than that of the membrane material, could contribute to lowering the conductive heat loss. For that reason, the membranes with high porosity could represent significant impact on enhancing the thermal efficiency of the MD process polarization (EL-BOURAWI et al., 2006; KHAYET, 2011; TAI et al., 2019) .", "2.5. Operating conditions and their effects on DCMD productivity", "Not only membrane materials and properties are determinants on MD process but furthermore are its configuration and operating conditions. In terms of productivity and capacity, DCMD system are lar gely affected by flow path of the feed and permeate (countercurrent or concurrent), material of system construction, means of heat exchange, mechanical and thermal properties of feed and permeate, and system configuration (ASH OOR There are four different types of MD – Direct Contact Membrane Distillation (DCMD), Air Gap Membrane Distillation (AGMD), Stream of Gas Membrane Distillation (SGMD), and Vacuum Membrane Distillation (VMD) –, and they differ mainly in two ways (ASHOOR et al., 2016) . The differences between all these four config urations are the types of medium in contact with the membrane at the permeate side and how the condensation of vapour occurs (TAI et al., 2019) ; throu gh direct contact with the liquid permeate stream (DCMD) or in a heat loss prevention method, such as vapour condensing in a cold surface after crossing an air gap (AGMD), vapour carriage to outside from the module (SGMD) or change in equilibrium condition s to force lower pressure on the permeate stream side increasing pressure gradient (VMD).", "In many DCMD studies temperature gradient has been identified as an important operating condition (YAO et al., 2020) . However, not only the temperature gradient but, moreover, values of temperature for the hot and c old sides are very important factors, as are the source of feed water, type of membrane, feed flow rate or velocity and module depth on the", "cold side (ASHOOR et al., 2016; YAO et al., 2020) . Figure 2.4 (a) and (b), from previous studies, show that, although high temperature on the feed side is desired for higher flux, feed flow properties such as the flow rate would determine the permeate flux at a particular operating temperature (ASHOOR et al., 2016) .", "Figure 2. 5 – (a) Variation of permeate flux and thermal efficiency according to feed temperature for a typical commercial Polypropylene membrane (permeate temperature of 20 °C) – highest thermal efficiency of 60% achieved while feed temperature at 70°C; temperature gra dient equivalent to 50°C. (b) Variation of permeate flux with feed temperature and flow velocity – highest permeate flux achieved whilst at maximum feed flow rate tested, of 0.52 m/sec (ASHOOR et al., 2016) .", "According to previous studies, there are three main conditions which significantly affect MD process; 1) temperature polarization, as previously mentioned, 2) the direction of inlet velocity, both from feed and distillate sides and 3) membrane properties, such as membrane thickness, porosity and tortuosity (ASHOOR et al., 2016; POLITANO et al., 2017) . Thus, the design of DCMD operations must consider these factors in order to improve effectiveness and productivity.", "2.6. Recent advances and current issues with DCMD", "As formerly mentioned, the choice of membrane material used i s a very determining factor on the efficiency of DCMD processes, consequently, most of the recent advances in MD process are related to the improvement of membranes materials (ASHOOR et al., 2016) . Despite the wide range of DCMD applications, such as for the treatment of groundwater, seawater, wastewater, produced water, radioactive water, and industrial processes water, hydrophobic membranes are to be chosen appropriately, depending on the target contaminants present in th e specific applications (ASHOOR et al., 2016) .", "Currently, some of MD processing benefits are its modular configuration, its flux and product quality being insensitive to feed salinity – up to ~ 200,000 mg/L – production of high distillate quality ( < 10 mg/L ) (AMY et al., 2017) . Although it requires a small footprint and it’s less susceptible to fouling than pressure -driven membranes (AMY et al., 2017) , membrane fouling is still a critical challenge that affect membrane processes (NTHUNYA et al., 2022) . MD further development main focus are membrane improvements (enabling higher permeate flux, present ing higher hydrophobicity and lower wettability) and applicable process configuration; while much bench -scale work has been done with DCMD, AGMD and VMD processes are receiving more attention due to their more favourable heat loss prevention (AMY et al., 2017; FRANCIS et al., 2014; GUILLÉN -BURRIEZA et al., 2012) .", "Numerous European companies have tested pilot MD process – and are marketing units with different capacities and configurations – but to make the scaling -up with efficient internal heat recovery , is one of the major challenges found , in the absence of affor dable high performance membranes (ADNAN et al., 2012; AMY et al., 2017; CIPOLLINA et al., 2012) . Therefore, to promote integration of waste heat recovery and utilization into the overall system, as well as a satisfactory permeate flux, are also some of the main challenges of this proc ess (ADNAN et al., 2012; AMY et a l., 2017; CIPOLLINA et al., 2012) .", "There has been an increasing interest in MD furthermore as part of a Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD) – an environmental friendly solution to reduce the energy consumption and the brine discharge, eventually leading to red uce the carbon footprint and its environment effects – scheme for inland desalination in which recovery is further increased to approach crystallization, and the process then becomes Membrane Distillation Crystallization (MDC)", "2.7.

Moreover, not only membrane systems can be built to function with energy provided from renewable sources (such as solar energy ), but as well can symbiotically run with systems that operate with high temperature gradient s, in a way that the membrane process take place functioning wit h the excess heat, preventing energy loss , improving general efficiency and economic viability , while encouraging more integration and partnerships within varied industry sectors.", "Due to the thermally driven nature of membrane distillation process, which requir es low- grade energy to operate, a lot of research has been put into it , on exploring this altern ative as a more cost effective compared to other conventional water treatment membrane processes (NTHUNYA et al., 2019) . Furthermore, membrane distillation generates a high distillate quality, which can be used as industrial reuse water, which contributes to a decrease in the demand for this increasingly scarce and expensive resource (FOUREAUX et al., 2020) . Conventional processes such as reverse osmosis and nanofiltration operate under high pressures, therefore are related to high energy consumption translated in costly producti on systems , another reason why interest in membrane distillation has risen very fast over the years (NTHUNYA et al., 2019) , as presented in Figure 2.6 (a) and (b) .

It was estimated that the cost of water production of 17 m3 /day in MD using geothermal energy is approximately $13 /m3 (year 2005 ). In the case where the heat supply in MD was sourced from electricity or fuel -fired plant, Meidersma et al. (year 2006) have calcul ated that the total cost of water was $0.16 – 0.17 /m3, relative to $0.25 – 0.35 /m3 required for a RO process. The cost estimated at the Memtill’s water recovery systems demonstrated that MD can reduce the cost of water desalination to $0.26 – 0.54 /m3. This considerable reduction was ascribed to the use of sustainable and cost -effective plant materials to build the operational modules as well as the use of low -cost heat supplies ( year 2006 ). When determining the cost implications associated with water pro duction in MD, the general parameters that were taken into consideration include the plant availability and capacity, interest rate (%), amortization, modules and membrane assembly ($/m2), installation ($), supporting equipment, ($) electrical cost ($/kWh) , steam cost ($/kg), labour cost ($/m3), brine disposal ($/m3), maintenance cost (%), pre -treatment cost ($/m3), thermal energy requirement (kWh/m3), emission factor for natural gas (kg CO 2-e/kWh), emission factor for electricity, (kg CO 2-e/kWh), electrical energy requirement (kWh/m3), and carbon tax ($/ton carbon).“ (NTHUNYA et al., 2019) .", "Regardless of membrane distillation research work advancing to pilot -scale level, according to the literature (NTHUNYA et al., 2022) the cost of small to medium -scale water desalination is higher in MD compar ed to RO (still the most popular membrane separation process). ,.

On the MD batch process with synthetic saline solution, it is expected the hot stream’s conductivity to increase along time , which can be observed in Figure 3.4(b). The results observed for hot and cold conductivity are also an indication of absence of liquid leakage through the membrane.

This fact points out two of the major influences on MD process efficiency: temperature difference between streams and the hydrodynamic conditions. According to literature, the higher the flow rate, the lesser the effects of temperature and concentration polarizations, therefore thermodynamically benefiting the system by promoting larger vapour pressure gradients between hot and cold streams, the drive for MD process.

A non -significant difference between these runs is noted, and such behavior can be explained by the combination of a polarization effect due to the lower feed flow rate and a lower water vapour pressure due to the higher content of salts (GUILLÉN -BURRIEZA et al., 2012) . However, permeance results are according to literature, in the range of temperature and flow rates studied, as it is repo rted the influence of the feed flow velocity on the effectiveness of distillate production (ADNAN et al., 2012; AL -OBAIDANI et al., 2008; FRANCIS et al., 2014; GUILLÉN -BURRIEZA et al., 2012) .

Guanabara’ s Bay water", "Membrane distillation has the potential to be used with low quality water with a high tendency to membrane fouling and scaling. Because of water scarcity several nearby industries already use desalinated water from Guanabara Bay and reverse osmosis is the main applied process. However, membrane lifetime and high cleaning frequency increase the cost of treated water, being a promising situation to investigate the technical reliability of MD. To carry out the set of experiments with Gu anabara’s Bay water as feed stream, Microdyn Membranes modules were used. System’s stream flow rates were set at 500 L/h and feed stream’s temperatures set to 45ºC, 50ºC and 65ºC, separately, with all trials running in batch process.", "In experiment with Guanabara’s Bay water, shown in Figure 3.7, a relatively small temperature difference (ca. 9ºC) was applied between saline and distillated streams, to investigate operation conditions with a possible use of waste heat available in many industrial processes , which can reduce the operation cost of MD. However, in this experiment it was observed a gradual temperature increase, both in the feed and in the permeate streams. Therefore, a decrease in the steams vapour pressure difference (mainly caused by the incr eased cold stream’s temperature), the driving force of the distillation process, promoted a decline in permeance over time – in addition to the presence of incrusting factors in the feed stream.", "Despite these factors, permeance values achieved ranged between 8.0 and 6.0 x 10-6 cm3.s- 1.cm-2.cmHg-1, equivalent values in comparison with experiment using synthetic saline solution, at the same flow rates (500 L/h) and feed stream temperature (55ºC) – Figure 3.7. Furthermore, it should be noted that the circula tion flow rate used was not high (500 L/h – equivalent Reynolds number pointing laminar flow ), which allowed larger heat exchange between feed and distillated currents , reducing permeation’s drivin g force.", "Figure 4.3.1 19– Desalination of Guanabara´s Bay Water First trial; Permeance as function of time, of Guanabara´s Bay Water.

With temperature gradient ne arly constant of 12ºC, the range of permeance variance was bigger – from 8.0 to 2.0 x 10-6 cm3.s- 1.cm-2.cmHg-1. One reason for this fact could lay on the quality of Guanabara’s water, which can easily vary considerably in a short period of time (observed through conductivity values during all trials ), being more (or less) polluted, therefore with different amount s of organic compounds contributing to the faster membr ane incrusting and clogging.", "On previous experiments ( running with similar parameters of flow rates and controlled temperatures), a constant temperature gradient between streams is noted. Another experiment carried out with Guanabara’s Bay water as feed s tream (Figure 3.9), ran likewise with flow rates at 500 L/h. However, on this experiment, both cold and hot streams temperature are kept constant and it was observed a constant value for permeance of approximately 8.0 x 10-6 cm3.s- 1.cm-2.cmHg-1. It seems evident that a high permeance value can be obtained with lower temperature variation along the MD module , similar to permeance values achieved on the beginning of previous experiments , meaning that, if streams temperatures for these processes were better controlled along time, same results could have been reached. 0,02,04,06,08,010,012,0 Time (h)", "Figure 4.3.2 20– Desalination of Guanabara´s Bay Water First trial; Permeance as function of time, of Guanabara´s Bay Water.

Introduction", "Given sustainability and circular economy principles having increasing importance in the global economy, throughout the most diverse range of industrial or non -industrial processes, deeper research and investments are being geared towards improving the bet ter usage of natural sources, energy and raw materials. In this context, Membrane Distillation is brought as a solution to face major grand challenges in the twenty -first century: to combat the growing scarcity of regional freshwater and to provide a susta inable treatment for one of the world’s heaviest burden, which is processes wastewater (AMY et al., 2017; XIE et al., 2016) . The accessibility to fresh water is currently recognized as a global issue of strategic relevance, as Water resources ar e unable to meet the ever -increasing demands from the industrial, domestic, agricultural and eco -environmental sectors (LIU et al., 2018a; SADR et al., 2016) . Therefore, sustainable and innovative seawater desalination technologies, also aimed at energy recovery (such as waste heat utilization), hav e found to be, since over a decade ago, potential", "ways to reduce the stress on the existing water and energy sources causing minimal impact to the environment, providing an economically and ecological way to produce drinkable water (GUDE; NIRMALAKHANDAN; DENG, 2010; POLITANO et al., 2017) .", "Membrane based systems for water treatment have been known since decades.

In recent years, M embrane Distillation (MD) has emerged either as a promising alternative or as a complement to Seawater Reverse Osmosis , not being limited by osmotic phenomena and having the potential to produce desalted water at recovery factors higher than 85% (POLITANO et al., 2017) .", "MD is a membrane technology that not only presents the capacity to treat highly saline water, including industrial wastewater, seawater, brine water from other processes, and oil -gas field produced water (YAO et al., 2020) , but can also be used in the food industry and on the production of chemical produc ts (ASHOOR et al., 2016) . While thermal desalination technologies exist (such as Multi -Stage Flash and Multi -Effect Distillation), interest has turned to membrane -based technologies because of more favo urable energetics – i.e., lower specific energy consumption ( kWh/m3). MD is both a thermal and a membrane technology, based on the use of microporous hydrophobic membranes , put in contact with a heated aqueous solution on the feed side and a cooled aqueous solution on the prod uct (distillate) side.

The pump’s input would come from both tanks, so as the output would go to both tanks ; Heater Flow Rate : the fluid ’s name used in the heat exchangers is ISO VG 46 (thermal oil or silicone oil, heated by immersed resistance), with operating temperature of 110ºC. The flow rate was experimentally set, targeting a decrease on the time needed for heat exchange between fluids (Hot fluid / Feed Stream) and on reaching system’s steady state; Temperatures : the digital control was based on setting the Feed Stream ’s desired temperature, and the boundaries for others temperatures – such as cold exchanger fluid, hot exchanger fluid and both input and output streams through the membrane module(s) ( feed and distilled s treams) ; Pressures : although the membrane fibers are hydrophobic , the membrane pressures difference (shell and lumen side) on the module must be kept low so that the water in the liquid phase does not pass through its pores .

Similar results for water permeation were obtained by using different membrane materials and construction characteristics (Mycrodyn and PAM), indicating that the main concerns are the process design and operation conditions . Furthermore, low conductivity in the distillate stream allows the use in several industrial applications such as vapor generation, cooling towers, etc. making possible use of different source of water and enhancing industrial process sustainability.

BDAC is mostly present in big companies that have the resources to develop big data pro jects. In contrast with big enterprises, SME ’s has an explicit limitation of resources to implement projects of this nature. This study explores how providers of big data analytics services in the cloud can impact BDAC on SMEs. Through the iPPi platform's case study , a study was carried about a Big Data Analytics tool available in the cloud for Ireland's re al estate s ector . The views of the platform devel oper and its customers were explored. The findings suggest positive impacts on technical capabilities and a good influence on educating service customers about big data. The study also shows that t he developm ent of BDACs go es beyond the mere acquisiti on of technological tools but includes developing a culture of data orientation in SMEs.

INTRODUCTION", "1.1 ORIGIN AND RELEVANCE OF THIS STUDY", "Knowledge, the fast speed of digitaliza tion, inform ation dissemination , and competi tion ha ve transformed busine sses recently (Bouwman et al., 2018). Data storage costs have reduced dramatically , and access to technology solutions became more democratic than before . People are continual ly gene rating much data through their connected devic es (EMC , The interaction b etween this vast amount of generated informati on and the capacity to extract value from this data is related to the Big Data concept . With the development of technolog ies that capture and sto re a tremendous amount of data, techniques and data analysis tools have also evolved, using data from strategic and operational perspective s. Organ izations can imp rove their services by analyzing customer’s purchases; enhance market strate gies through marketing c ampaign analysis; use a m ore evidence -based knowledge co -creation of products, and achieving sustainabil ity through long -term risk analysi s (Wang, Shouhong & The benefits of Big Data are still more readily available for larger fir ms. They concentrate the market share, customers, and prof its away from those w ith no data (McAfee, 2012). Even though there is some availability access to data in a more democratic way , these companies still hav e some monopo ly of restr icted data, analytical skills, confidence, and internal resource s (O’Connor, C. and Kelly, S. , 2017 ).", "In this scenario, small and medium -sized enterpris es (SMEs) are inserted. These companies contribute over 5 0 percent to gross domes tic product (GDP) and around two-thirds to formal employment ( World SME For um, 2017). They act as the main e conomic growth element by creating job opp ortunities , being innovative and productive ( Maroufkh ani et al., 2020 ; OECD , 2017 ; Singh, 2019 ; Talebi et al., 2012 ). In a globalized environment, one of the effective methods to re duce poverty and inequality in developing countries is developing and improving SMEs' position in the m arketplace ( Maroufkhani et al., 2020 ; Talebi et al., 2012 ). SMEs are an essential pillar of the economy.", "Given the importance of SM Es, the adoption of B ig Data and Big Data Analytics (BDA) is a critical topic. The deve lopment of an alytical cap abilities is c rucial for these enterprises. Competition is one of the main reasons SMEs must adopt BDA (Tien et al.,", "2020). The use of BDA can enable SMEs to have be tter performance, as they are more flexible than large co mpanies (Ogbuokiri et al., 2015). The recent even ts during the COVID - 19 lockdown also br ought up the importance of using more big data analytics in post- pandemic decis ion-making. BDA technologies can help companies dealing with the kind of phenomena t hat companies may struggl e with during lockdown: rapidly shifting consumer demand and confidence, operational disruptions, uncertainty, and redundancies in the workforce (OEC D, 2020).", "SMEs lagged in using BDA technologies ( Coleman et al., 201 6; Tien et al. , 2020 ). These companies are often limited by scarce financial and organizational resources ( Vajjhala & Ramollari, 2016 ) and a lack of understanding of how businesses dea l with the process of BDA implemen tation and value ge neration ( Mika lef et al., 2019 ).", "Despite this, SME s can access DBA technologies through cloud computing solutions. Cloud computing technologies enable a business to rent computing infrastructure and softwa re services from a third -party provider without up front investme nt in ICT c apital (Marston et al., 2011 ; OECD , 2017 b; OECD 2014 ; OECD 2019 ; Venters and Whitley, 2012 ). In the context of Big Data Analytics, there are cloud solution providers of big data an alytics solutions. These compan ies own the experti se and manage the infrast ructure , offering the results and t ools to access information and insights more affordabl y. However, big data and big data analytics are complex topic s. Even having some access to the technology, the company need s other in ternal capabilities to extract value from the big data. For example, companies must have data science skills or understand and incenti vize manag ers to foster t his culture .", "In this context , this research proposes a case study on a cloud solution provider , iPPi, that offers big data analytics as a service for small and mid -sized real estate companies in Ireland. Most of its clients had no expertise bu ilt on big data analytics before using the platform. The service provider's goal is to bundle most of the technical aspects needed for big data analytics in an environment where the available data is abunda nt. They provide da ta and analytical capabilities for their clients via a cloud platform.", "The analysis of this platform that provides big data analyt ics as a service was done through the Dynamic Capabilities View (DCV) lens, also using the f oundations of the Big Data Analyt ics Capabilities (BDAC) framework developed by Mikalef et al.

Mikalef et al. (2017), in their literature review , bring up 14 definitions of the term big data. Several explana tions were analyzed to guide this st udy. In sum, B ig data can be defined by the following characteristics , the called 7V’s, that was built from an incremental contribution of the different auth ors alon g the time: Volume - Represents the shee r size of the dataset due to the aggregatio n of many variables and an even larg er set of observations for each variable (George et al., 2016) ; Velocity - Reflects the speed at which data are collected and ana lyzed, w hether in real- time or near real-time fr om sensors, sales, transactions, social medi a posts, and sentiment data for bre aking news and social trends (George et a l., 2016) ; Veracity – Veracity ensures that the data used are trusted, authentic, and p rotected from unauthorized access and modificatio n (Demchenko et al., 2013) ; Variet y – In big data, veracity comes from the plur ality of structured and u nstructu red data sourc es such as text, videos, ne tworks, and graphics , among other s (George et a l., 2016 ); Value - Value represents the extent to which big data genera tes economically wor thy insights and benefits through extraction and transformation ( Wamba et al., 2015) ; Variability - Concerns how i nsight from media constantly changes as the same information is interpreted differentl y, or new s feeds from other sources help to sha pe a different outcome (Seddon and Currie, 2017) ; Visualization - It can be described as interpreting the patterns and trends present in the data (Seddon and Currie, 2017).", "2.2 BIG DATA ANALYTICS (BDA)", "There are different ways to d efine big data analy tics.

Big data i nvolves a high volum e of information in increase d velocity and or high variety information assets that require new forms of processing to enable enhanced decision making, insight discovery , and process optimization (Beyer, M. A., Laney, D., 2012) . To extra ct value from big data in an efficient way is a problem th at requi res complex s tructures. Moreover, this is especially true for a field that is in constant evolution , and new tools, solutions , and techniques arise on a day-to-day basis. To fulfill the po tential of service -orientation is necessary to develop unique technologies to process large quantities of data within acceptable processing time effectively and easy access to the analys is (Zheng , Z., Zhu, J., & Lyu, M. R., 2013). The big data -as-a- service e ncapsulate all this i n a bund le of a data storage solution (usually cloud), management, and analytics techniques into services an d provides common big data-related services to users via programmable APIs and o r visual interfaces, which greatly enhances efficiency, reduce costs , and en ables seamless integration (Zheng et al., 2013 ). Zheng et al. (2013) created a conceptu al framewor k of Big Data -as-a-Service , which involves three layers: Bid Data I nfrastructure -as-a-Service, Big Data Platform -as-a-Servic e, and Big Data Analytics Soft ware -as-a-Service.

The different schools of strategy can be organized into two big classes . The first one is the early strategic theories that focused mainly on the environment outside of the company as the ele ments that should gui de the c ompany strategy . The second one, which emerged dec ades later, had a look s hifted to a resource -based view, where the important factor s were inside the", "company ( Carvalho, 2019). Below is a brief review of each th eory and its mai n characteristics to provide a better context until we finally reach out to the Dynamic Capabilities view definition.", "The early theories around business strategy views argued th at exte rnal market factors shape a firm’s perfo rmance. J.S Bain ( Bain, J. S. , 1968). developed the Structure -Conduct - Performance (SCP) paradigm, which stated that four elements impact the market structure: Supply (number of competitors), demand, p roduct diff erentia tion, and entry barriers. For Bain, t he company's performance is a co nsequence of its environment (Carvalho, 2019). Later , Porter’s work “How Compet itive Forces Sha pe Strategy ” introduce d the five force models: the threat of new entrants, the bargaining power o f customers, the t hreat of sub stitute products and services, the bargaining power of suppliers , and the competition for a position among compet itors in its indu stry (Porte r, 1979). Porter is another ex ample of this clas s of theories that focus on external factors to explain firms' succes s.", "The second kind of theories was formally introduced for th e business literature by Birger Wernerfelt in his article “A Resource -based View of the Firm” in 1984, even though there was already literature focusing on companies’ resources as factors that co ntribute to their growth, as the famous “The Theor y of the Gr owth ”, 1959, wrote by Edith Penrose. A resource is “tangible and intangible a ssets tied semi-perma nently to the firm” defined by Wernerfelt. The g oal of Wernerfelt 's paper is to identif y “which circumstances will a resource lead to high returns over longer periods ” (Wernerfelt, 1984, p. 172). Another impo rtant author of the resource -based strategic manage ment theory is Jay Barney ; in his article “Firm Resources and Sustai ned Comp etitive Advantage”, 1991, brings up the inve stigat ion of conditions that help resources yield high returns and lead these reso urces to become a source of a sustaine d competitive adva ntage (Barney, 1991). It is important t o cite Barney since he expand s the de finition of resource to “all as sets, capab ilities, organizational processes, firms’ attributes, information, knowledge”, and that for these resource s to be a pote ntial source of sustained competitive advantage, they must be valuable, rare, imperfec tly imit able and must not have an equiv alent subst itute (Barney, 1991).", "There was also a specific branch of the Resource -based view , called Knowledge -based View, as its first author also suggests, Robert M. Grant (Grant, 1996 ), it is an outgrowth of the resource -based approach. In his paper, h e explores the va rious mechanisms by which firms coordinate this specialist knowledge that it s members possess. The y classi fy knowledge in two forms, explicit knowledge, or “Knowing abo ut facts and theories”, and tacit knowledge,", "the “knowing how”. He exposes that explicit knowledge is much more transferable than tacit knowledge, which is much more c ostly and time -consuming to transfer (Grant, 1 996, p. 111). He emphasizes the i mportance of the scope of kno wledge t o a capability and how it contributes to the resource -based v iew's inimitability factor . As broader and more integrated with the knowledge within a capability, the more d ifficult an imitation become s. This situation is a source of cas ual ambiguity and replication barriers (Grant, 1996 , p 117). Grant also touches on an interesting point that can be explored further for this proposed study. He brings up that k nowledge is often bu ilt from strategic alliances . Companies need to reach their boundaries for knowledge and innovation (What brings us the justifi cation of the r elationship between te chnological service provide rs and clients that do not pos sess such expertise and knowledge).", "The Dynami c Capability view is part of the theoretical perspectives that use the fi rm as the analysis unit . The approach was first presented by Teece, Pisano, and Shuen (1997 ), using th e resource-based view fundaments, b ut w ith the difference that the d ynamic capabilities stress “exploiting internal and external, firm -specific competence s to address changing environments”. According to Eisenhar dt and Martin ( 2000), most of the authors describe D CV as a se t of identifiable and specific routines that have often be en the subject of extensive empirical research. Such routines are e asily recog nized, learned, patterned , and repetitious, directed towar ds independent cor porate actions (Winter , 2003). These set s of routines are oft en defined as capabilities. However, it is impor tant to stress that these routines are not ad -hoc events. Nevertheless, they are in co nstant adaptation and changes (Henderson and Venkatraman, 1993).", "To have a bet ter understan ding of the d ifference between the different schools of thought, Pankaj M. Madhan i (Madha ni, 2010 ) presents the characteristics of the other theories based on two dimensions, the degree of change of the marke t and which unit of analysis the theory focus, the firm, or the market. He na mes the first school of thought presented above a s Market Based view. The result of th ese differences is shown in the figure below.", "Figure 1 - Characteris tics of RBV, MBV , and Dyn amic Capabili ties", "Source: Madhani, 2010", "The r eason to choose DCV as the foundation of the study is based on the fact that big data is a theme developed in a conte xt where technology is evolving fast , and companies are dynamicall y evolving their process and culture to new trends . Mark ets are changing with the impact of technology. The unit of analys is is th e firm. The theoretical groundings of RBV are also go ing to be used since it provides solid foundations for all relevant resou rces and how to evaluate their impor tance, while DCV enable s us to exami ne the organizational capabilities and how they sh ould be directed to achieve competitive performan ce gains by using big data in this environment of constant changes ( Mikalef et al. , 2016) It is also impo rtant to note about competitive a dvantage in platforms tha t provide services for sever al cl ients. A firm is said to have a com petitive advantage when implementin g a v alue-creating strategy , not simultaneously being implemente d by any c urrent or potenti al competitors (B arney, J. B., 1991). For this study, the discussion strategy is by building the data analytics capabiliti es on the firms.", "One cold analys is could sa y the platform itself could play the role of the strateg y that creates val ue. Being a platf orm that one subscription is enough would not be a competitive advantage since competitors can easily acquire it . As Barney (1986a) wrote, technolo gies that can be purchased across markets a re likely to be imitable and thus not a sour ce of sustained compet itive advantage.", "However, other researchers d emonstrated that , even though the technol ogy can be readily available for different fir ms, only a few can create a close human -computer interface. Thus, this kind of infor mation processing syst em may be ra re (Christe, 1985; Rasmussen, 1986 ). It is also a socially complex system and will probably be imperfectly imitable (Barney, J B, 1991). Moreover, it reinforc es th is study's proposal - where the DCV strategic theory better explains the interact ion with the tech nology, the processes , and the need for human resources and sk ills. The competitive advantage can be achi eved by building capabilities that may not be imitable. The interaction between the technol ogy and the firm does not happen in the sam e form. Discoveri ng how these process works show its value.", "2.5 BIG DATA ANALYTIC S CAPABILITIE S (BDAC)", "The term BDAC (Big Data An alytics Capabilities) was proposed to d efine the b roader range of aspects that big dat a projects must have to succeed (Mikalef et al., 2018). In the literature , there are different definitions for BDA. Howeve r, they have the same essence by defining BDA as a firm's ability to provide insights using data management, infrastructure, and talent to tr ansform a business into a competitiv e force (Akter et al., 2016a; Kiron et al. , This research c ould find few studies about the application of BDAC and i ts impact on firms.

For the tran sactions, the address, the value of the trade, and the date were the only data registered. Even the addr esses were published lacking information like street names , the house number , number of beds, baths, and size of the property.", "To work arou nd the lack of the property price register data's meaning , the 4property owner had th e first idea to store all the property p rice register data and their internal data and information from the publicly listed property listing s portal to rebuild complete details of the property transaction. The company could expand the information of prope rty price register matching all the different so urces. The result was a complete knowledge about the t ransaction, property fea tures, and its phase during th e period they were for sale , the informati on from the Ireland census data, geol ocation from online geocoding services , and other data aggregation from differ ent source s.", "The second phase of iPPi c onsisted of wrapping up all this data and making it sellable for groups that could use all thi s information in their business.

From the client’s side, looking to a pproach a h etero gene ity of customers' segment s, each of the following type s of client empl oyee s is interviewed : real estate agencie s, investme nt companies , and governmen t agencies. The inte rviews were done through Skype, recorded , and all material was transcript to a text document. The interview guide was based on the study of Mikalef et al. (2 019), which evaluates the presence o f the major dimensions of the big data analytics capabilities ( data, technology, peopl e, organization, and process) by having specific quest ions for each dimension. There is a set of questions to cover the peri od before and after the iPPi platform user adoption . They were used to identi fy th e impacts for each BDAC dimension. There were slight modifications in the questions to ma ke it easier to understand our interviewees .

For this dimension, the focus was on interviewing the skilled technic al staff of the com panies. It could also be used as auxiliary material from any documentatio n and platform a nalysis. From the int erview , it was necessary to identify if the company used cloud solutions, technologies for processing large amounts of d ata, the to ols to operate and visualized the data, the existence or use of databases specific for d ealing with big data, and the in -house expertise of the company on managing these technologies (based on the BDA technology capability from the authors ' Dave nport et al ., 2012 , Kiron et al ., 2014, McAfee et al., 2012 and Wamba et al., 2015) .

The core data is the Property Price Register, a government database that publishes all property transa ctions in Ireland. Other sources augment this data . Their source s are:  Public property listings portal - portals that publish properties for sales. Well known as “Property classifieds”, they are extremely popu lar cha nnels to search and pub lish properties f or sale. iPPi works by crawling these classifieds every day, maintaining the property's information and its features updated.  Census Data - Census is the procedure of systematical ly acqu iring and recording information about a given populat ion's members . Like most countries, the Ireland government also runs i ts census a nd make s its result public. This information is important for iPPi because it can use the definitions of areas and cross -data to generate statistics at a small region al level. The census is run every five years. So, this informatio n does not need to be upd ated so often.", " Google and Microsoft A PIs - Google and Microsof t offer several services for consulting data online. They are valuable for the service being provided , where some APIs offer detailed information about geolocation an d add resses. Google maps , for example , has several services to decode raw addresses . By doing so, they can return from raw address information of it s geocode locati on (latitude and longitude) a nd the detailed information about nearby ame nities.  4Property dat a - The company itself has valuable data about its customers and their public list ings of properties.

The inte rviewee described his company d oing only basic data usage , using primitive technologies to store data and manage them before using the platform . “Not a huge amount of data i s held by our organizat ion. And, you know, we are kind of about a boutique kind of firm. S o, we only handle a handful of client s. And in terms of data, we don't deliberately collect data. ” - Interviewee Company H Most companies demonstrated that they keep mos t of the data held by the m through tools like CRM.

T he reason is that most of the clients reported that they do no t have inte rnal IT teams for developing a nd managing their infrastru cture – they are outsourcing this reso urce. They rely on cloud solutions or only having on ly one person with a technical r ole. Two companies reported having their own IT team, but they were inserted in t he franchisee's business model . The IT team was for the franchise, and it was not under the franchisee. “He is our tech guy. He does.

So, the re are a number of platforms we are ex amining. Now there is a platform calle d Cloudera SDK3. So that's kind of open. It is based on o pen-source projects. It is a conglomerate of open -source projects. W e are also looking at a techn ology called confluent.io 4in the streaming domain . […] And ways we have used inside of Elasticsearch5, we use th e Kibana6, regarding being able to just query data, and we are using them and some bespoke kind of graph, graphica l kind of frameworks to actua lly be able to analyze and display some of the data on the front end. ” - Interviewee CEO Service Provider It is also interesting to note th at the c ompany has awareness about monitoring the new technologies, testing them, and repr oducing the market standards f or bi g data proc essing. Moreover, the entry cost is getting sm aller, a ccording to the interviewee. “I feel that any company that can handle the technolog y appropriately, and the cost of entry is becoming less, and the y are be coming more and more standardized. S o tha t's when co mpanies, l ike 4property can exploit it b ecause t hat means it's not high technology anymore. ” - Interviewee CTO Service Provi der We can also conclude that the service provider can replace t he development of the companies' needed technolog ies, giving the m fast access to explore the outc ome of big data . Even though clients do not have the technological infrastructure or sufficie nt technical support to handle big data analytics, they can acce ss this as a service . Their partner (the platform) pr ovide s them datab ases, cloud, and other techn ological resources for big data analytics.

The clients interviewed see m to be practicing the simple t ype of analysis. In sum, regard ing people capabilities, it w as found that the service provider was able to fulfill the need for technical skills. However, there are still missing pure data science skilled people responsible to constan tly analyze and generate in sights from all the data in different way s.

Another a rrange ment is having a data scienti st on the service pr ovider, extracting and creating insights that coul d benefit all the clients. In this arrange ment, there is a loss of the potential to build differe ntiation on the client s, but it could back competitiven ess against bigger or mo re matur e companies in the BDA field.

Usually, these processes are related to data governance, including data migration, data retention, cost allocation, analyti c data procedures, and access rights ( Mikalef et al., 2019) . This aspect was only enquired to the service provider's clients , as they are the part that should benefit most of the data service.

It is cl osely related to the c ompany's capacit y to build a data -driven culture and how the organization can adapt to changes in its env ironment. Even though most of the companies did not have a clear da ta-driven culture, th e step towards subscribing to a data anal ytics platform ca n demonstrate a movement i n its direction .

CONCLUSIO N", "How bi g data analytics platfor ms influence and build capabiliti es for big data analytics at SM Es? Although the study's case is a service that is still beginning , this st udy can conclude that this type of service can bring positive b enefits for its clients. By starting with the access to the data, it is noti ceable how impactf ul it is to have a platform that offers high-quality data for its users. Most clients did not have a ccess or structure to build with the same quali ty data wareh ouse to store, process , and maintain data from mu ltiple sources. It is not affordable for SME s. In the case of the service provider , which offered other range o f products that potent ially increase the own ership of d ata from multi ple clients , also offered a CRM for its clients, access to non -sensitive i nformation from multiple users can build exclusi ve and rich data. There is an oppo rtunity to build c ompetitiven ess for SME’s clients of the service provider, building resources that usually are exclusive for big companies. If these resources are a pplied strategicall y, probably these companies can deve lop some competitive a dvanta ges. In technology capability, the service provider has been up to date with the most recent technologies and tec hniques to process data. In the lon g term, maintaining the relationship between the employe es and the technology can improve the accessib ility of tools and advanced infra structure to compute data.", "Both parts, the service provider and the clients , demonstrated to lack of skilled professional s on data analysis (data scientists ). Even though the p latform's purpose is to provide data, having data scientist professiona ls benefit the platform in terms of the data's orientation enrichens a nd possibly creates standardized reports and tools for sp ecific cases. The access of data is not enough if it is not explored properly. The cl ients also reported a focus of use on operational task s as an intense use on creating valuation s. There was no formal approach to training employees about big data and data a nalysis. However, some users evidenced that the platform was the only access they had for formal data analytics training . The training can also be one asp ect of data analyt ics platforms. Moreover, the differ entiation can be built upon t he internal knowledg e and how it made the interaction b etween people and the technology , as initially defended by Christe, 1985 and Rasmussen, 1986 .

Nevertheless, there is still a va st amount of value to be explor ed in other fields that depend on companies building internal skills to explore them and create a data -driven culture .", "Sub subsc ribing to the data analytics service is evidence of seeing data as something worth th e investment. Moreover, a data-drive n cultu re determines the extent to which organization al decisions are made based on the ext racted insight (G upta & George, 2016). Howev er, it is not clear how the companies will further develop data in most o f their decisions. At least for the clients' use case s, they were more oriented to operatio nal uses . There was a more standardized workflow tool (the property valuation), the adoption demonstrated to be solid. An i mportant aspect of c ompanies with strong data -driven culture is relational practices concerned with the formalized links b etween empl oyees of t he technical and business sides. This link encapsulate s practices and means o f kno wledge sharing, educat ion, traini ng, and strategic planning (Kooper et al., 2011; Mikalef et al., 2019). Data analytics can play a role in that. Ho wever, until now , it did no t strate gically create a real data - driven culture . The service provider can play t he role of bring ing impor tant capabilities. Building differentiation and changing the cult ure is necessary to advance the client’s maturity use of data, and probabl y it will come with time.

From th e client ’s perspect ive, it is important to cite that the technology itself will not replace the need to build the mi ndset of making dec isions based on the data.

Another impo rtant point to high light is that clients are originated f rom a very conservative type of market - the real estate market.

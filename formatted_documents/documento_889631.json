No artigo Perception of change in sexual activity in Alzheimer’s Disease: views of people with dementia and their spouse -caregivers , um estudo transversa l, foram avaliados 74 portadores de DA e seus cônjuges -cuidadores , comparando -os com 21 casais de idosos sem comprometimento cognitivo (grupo controle) . A satisfação sexual, estado cognitivo, gravidade da doença, consciência da doença, funcionalidade, sintomas depressivos dos portadores de DA, qualidade de vida e sobrecarga dos cônjuges foram avaliados. Foi encontrada diferença significativa entre a percepção e não percepção de mudança na atividade sexual entre portadores de DA, seus cônjuges -cuidadores e c asais sem comprometimento cognitivo. Ainda, cônjuges -cuidadores apresentaram maior insatisfação sexual quando comparados aos pacientes com DA e o grupo controle. A regressão linear demonstrou que o estado cognitivo foi preditor da satisfação sexual dos portadores de DA. Para os cônjuges -cuidadores, a regressão linear demonstrou que os preditores da satisfação sexual foram o gênero e a presença de atividade sexual. Cônjuges -cuidadores e seus parceiros com DA apresentaram maior percepção de mudança na ativida de sexual e maior insatisfação sexual quando comparados aos casais sem demência. O artigo Domains of Quality of life in Alzheimer’s Disease vary according to caregiver kinship comparou transversalmente a QdV e seus domínios entre 49 cônjuges - cuidadores e 49 cuidadores não -cônjuges. Foram avaliadas a qualidade de vida, consciência da doença, estado cognitivo, severidade da demência, humor e sobrecarga de cuidado. Os cônjuges -cuidadores apresentaram ser mais velhos, com maior nível de sobrecarga e pior estado cognitivo. O escore total da QdV não apresentou diferença significativa entre os grupos de cuidadores . Entretanto, houve diferença significativa entre os domínios de saúde física, casamento, amigos, além de uma tendência para vi da em geral. Quando os domínios de QdV foram analisados entre as díades, houve diferença significativa entre os dom ínios para energia, capacidade para atividades de lazer e memória para os cônjuges -cuidadores e seus parceiros com DA. Para os cuidadores não -cônjuges e seus parceiros com DA, foram encontradas diferenças significativas para os domínios para memória, casamento, amigos e capaci dade para realizar tarefas. As diferenças entre as avaliações da QdV somente foram encontradas quando a QdV foi analisad a por domínios, demonstrando assim, que cônjuges -cuidadores e cuidadores não -cônjuges possuem específicos fatores e diferentes percepções sobre o que é importante para avaliar a sua própria QdV. O artigo Quality of Life of People with Alzheimers’ disease: Comparison between different kinship avaliou de forma transversal 98 pacientes com DA e seus respectivos cuidadores (49 cônjuges -cuidadores e 49 cuidadores não cônjuges). Foram aplicados instrumentos para avaliar a qualidade de vida, estado cognitivo, grav idade da demência, funcionalidade dos portadores de DA, sintomas depressivos, ansiedade e sobrecarga do cuidador. A auto avaliação da QdV dos portadores de DA foram avaliadas e comparadas entre pacientes casados e pacientes não casados. Ainda, a auto avaliação da QdV dos portadores de DA foi comparada com a avaliação realizada pelos cuidadores sobre a QdV dos pacientes com DA. O escore total da QdV dos diferentes tipos de pacientes com DA não apresentou diferença significativa. A regressão linear demonstrou que uma maior consciência da doença foi relacionada à QdV dos pacientes com DA que possuem como cuidadores os seus cônjuges. Para os pacientes com DA que possuem como cuidadores algum familiar que não fosse o seu cônjuge, a QdV foi negativament e relacionada com sintomas depressivos dos próprios pacientes com DA. Ao comparar as avaliações realizadas pelos cuidadores sobre a QdV dos pacientes, não houve diferença significativa no escore total. Entretanto, a regressão linear demonstrou que a avalia ção de cuidadores não - cônjuges estava relacionada a sintomas depressivos dos pacientes, consciência da doença e humor dos próprios cuidadores. Para os cônjuges - cuidadores, os fatores relacionados à QdV dos pacientes foram os sintomas depressivos dos pacien tes e sobrecarga dos cuidados dos cuidadores. Apesar de ambos os grupos apresentarem escores similares para a QdV total, as díades apresentaram diferentes fatores para a avaliação da QdV.", "Demonstrando que diferentes díades avaliam de forma distinta os preditores que influenciem a QdV.

Questões sobre o relacionamento conjugal, a satisfação sexual e a percepção de mudança da at ividade sexual após o início da demência foram realizadas. Utilizando o método interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA), três temas surgiram: Impacto psicológico e emocional, impacto social e impacto sexual. As causas relata das para mudanças na atividade sexual variaram entre as modificações na atividade sexual antes do início da doença causa das pelo envelhecimento ou efeitos relacionados à progressão da DA. O gênero pode ser percebido como preditor para a percepção da mudança na relação conjugal, mas não para as mudanças na atividade sexual. Essa tese teve como foco principal o estudo da Qual idade de vida de uma população específica: casais nos quais um dos cônjuges seja portador de DA. Assim, esses achados podem ser de extrema importância para a otimização de intervenções psicoeducacionais específicas para casais , uma vez que por possuírem um relacionamento mais próximo, esse grupo possui particularidades que necessitam ser analisadas de forma específica.", "Palavras -chave: Qualidade de vida, cônjuges, satisfação sexual, Doença de Alzheimer.", "Abstract", "Nogueira, Marcela Moreira Lima.

The specific aim s were (1) to evaluate the influence of sexual satisfaction on QoL and the perception of change in sexual activity after the ons et of dementia in dyads; (2) to evaluate the definitions and changes in QoL on couples , in which one partner was diagnosed with AD; (3) to investigate changes in the evaluation of QoL between kinships. In the article Perception of change in sexual activity in Alzheimer’s Disease: views of people with dementia and their spouse - caregivers , 74 people with Alzheimer Disease (PwAD) and their spouse - caregivers were evaluated, cross -sectionally and compar ed with 21 elderly couples without cognitive impairment (con trol group). Sexual satisfaction, cognitive impairment, severity of the disease, awareness of disease, functionality, depressive symptoms of PwAD, QoL and burden of care were evaluated . There was a significant difference between perception and no perception of change in sexual activity of PwAD, spouse -caregivers and control group. Spouse -caregivers showed higher sexual dissatisfaction when compared to PwAD and control group. The linear regression demonstrated that PwAD sexual satisfaction was relat ed to cognitive impairment. Spouse - caregivers sexual satisfaction was related to gender and the presence of sexual activity. Spouse -caregivers and PwAD showed higher perception of change in sexual activity and higher sexual dissatisfaction when compared to couples without dementia. In the paper entitled Domains of Quality of life in Alzheimer’s Disease vary according to caregiver kinship , we cross - sectionally compared the QoL and domains of 49 spouse -caregivers and 49 non-spouse caregivers. We assessed the QoL, awareness of disease, cognitive impairment, severity of dementia, mood and burden of care. Spouse -caregivers were older, with higher levels of burden, and lower score for cognition . The total score of caregivers’ QoL showed no significant difference according to the degree of kinship. There was a significant difference in domains for physical health, marriage, friends , and a trend for life as a whole . When the domains of QoL were analyzed between dyads , there was a significant difference in domai ns for energy , ability to do things for fun and memory for spouse dyads. In non-spouse dyads, there was a significant difference in QoL domains for memory, marriage, friends and ability to do chores. The differences between the spouse and non -spouse groups only appeared when QoL was analyzed by domains. Spouse and non -spouse caregivers have specific assessment and perceptions about what is important to evaluate their own QoL. The paper Quality of Life of People with Alzheimers’ disease: Comparison between different kinship cross -sectionally assessed 98 PwAD and their caregivers (49 spouse -caregivers and 49 non -spouse caregivers). We evaluate d the QoL, cognitive impairment, severity of the disease, functionality, depressive symptoms, anxiety and burden of car e. The self -report of spouse and non - spouse PwAD QoL was evaluated and compared between married and not married PwAD . Thus, the self -report PwAD QoL was compared to caregivers’ ratings of PwAD QoL. The total score of QoL for spouse and non -spouse PwAD show ed no significant difference. The linear regression demonstrated that higher awareness of disease was significantly related to spouse -PwAD QoL. Non-spouse PwAD QoL was negatively related to lower depression. The comparison between spouse and non -spouse caregivers’ ratings of PwAD QoL showed no significant difference. The linear regression demonstrated that non - spouse caregivers’ ratings of PwAD QoL w ere related to depression of non - spouse -PwAD, awareness of disease and the mood of caregiver. Spouse - caregivers’ ratings of PwAD QoL was related to depressi ve symptoms of spouse -PwAD and burden of care. Although both groups showed similar scores of total QoL dyads evalu ate differently about what is important to assess QoL. Different dyad s evaluate from a different point of view the factors that influenced the QoL. In the paper Changes in marital relationship and sexual activity according to spouse -carers’ view: A qualita tive study semi -structured interviews were conducted to explore spouse -carer’s experiences of 11 spouse - caregivers with the changes that occurred in the marital relationship after the onset of AD . Questions about marital relationship, sexual satisfaction a nd perception of change of sexual activity were answered. The data were analysed using interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA), and three themes emerged: Psychological and emotional impact, Social impact, and Sexual impact. The causes for changes in sexual activity varied among modifications of sexual activity before the onset of dementia because of aging or effects of the illness. Gender may influence the perception of change in ma rital relationship, but not the changes in sexual activity. This study was mainly focused in evaluate the QoL of a specific population: couples with one spouse with AD. Than, these findings may have extremely importance to the optimization of psychoeducational interventions to couples, once this group has particular needs that should be analyzed from a specific way.", "Keywords: Quality of life, spouse, sexual satisfaction, Alzheimer’s Disease", "Sumário Capítulo 1: Perception of change in sexual activity in Alzheimer’s Disease: views of people with dementia and their spouse -caregivers 26 Capítulo 2: Domains of Quality of life in Alzheimer’s Disease vary according to caregiver kinship 56 Capítulo 3 : Quality of Life of People with Alzheimers’ disease: Comparison between different kinship 76 Capítulo 4 : Changes in marital relationship and sexual activity according to spouse -carers’ view: A qualitative study 103 Discussão 124 Conclusão 127 Referências Bibliográficas 128 Aprovação no Comitê de Ética (CEP) 135 Anexo s 136", "1. Introdução", "1.1 Doença de Alzheimer", "O surgimento de doenças crônico -degenerativas, dentre elas as demências, ocorrem com relativa frequência no envelhecimento (NOVELLI et al., 2010). Dentre as demências, destacaremos a Doença de Alzheimer (DA) , uma doença cerebral primária com início insidioso e progressão gradual de prejuízo em um ou mais domínios cognitivos. Apresenta manifestações comportamentais e psicológicas; sendo s ua apresentação característica amnéstica, com prejuízo da memória e da aprendi zagem (APA, 2013). Por possuir característica progressiva, o portador de DA se torna cada vez mais dependente dos outros para desempenhar atividades instrumentais e básicas da vida diária (NOVELLI et al., 2010) . As perdas cognitivas e as mudanças comportam entais, emocionais e de personalidade geram uma crescente dependência ao cuidador (I NOUYE et al., 2009 , DOURADO et al., 2010 ). Tal dependência influencia na vida de ambos os membros da díade : para o cuidador, é necessário se adaptar à s mudanças do cotidian o; para os portadores de DA, sua inserção no mundo como indivíduo sofre comprometimento (INOUYE et al., 2009; NOVELLI et al., 2010).", "1.2 Qualidade de vida", "O termo Qualidade de vida (QdV) possui diferentes definições , podendo enfatiza r a satisfação geral com a vida ou ser dividida em componentes, que, em conjunto, se aproximam do conceito geral. C ada conceit o envolve diferentes aspectos, que são abordados a partir dos interesses de cada área de investigação. É comum que o conceito de Qd V seja entendido como um sinônimo de saúde. Entretanto, os dois conceitos, apesar de possuírem grande relação entre si, possuem especificidades e não devem ser considerados como o mesmo conceito. Além disso, o conceito de QdV , de uma maneira geral, deve investigar a subjetividade dos indivíduos e diversos indicadores como escolaridade e aus ência de sintomas de doença (Pereira , 2012) . Segundo Day (1996), existem quatro aspectos gerais sobre a QdV: econômico, psicológico, biomédico e holístico. O aspecto econômico possui como principal elemento os indicadores sociais e econômicos . Assim, possuir uma boa qualidade de vida dependeria da presença de estruturas sociais e econômicas mínimas que permitiriam alcançar a felicidade. Sendo assim, ascensão econômica, moradia, educação, problemas com violência e criminalidade estariam diretamente ligados à QdV.", "A abordagem psicológica, por sua vez, utiliza as reações subjetivas de cada sujeito, ou seja, suas vivências, como percebem suas vidas e satisfação. A principal limitação da abordagem psicológica é o fato de avaliarem a QdV somente como um aspecto subjetivo desco nsiderando o contexto ambiental, por considerarem os indicadores sociais e objetivos limitados , que serviriam apenas como indicadores indiretos de QdV.", "A abordagem médica surgiu, inicialmente, na comunidade médica, pois os tratamentos médicos, embora estendendo a vida, podem reduzir sua qualidade. Assim, para avaliar se os benefícios do tratamento são maiores que o sofrimento envolvido, a abordagem médica se dedica a avaliar subjetivamente a QdV dos pacientes e o impacto do estado de saúde na capacidade de viver plenamente , oferecendo melhoria nas condições de vida, condição de saúde e funcionamento social.", "A abordagem holística, também chamada de abordagem geral, entende a QdV como um conceito multidimensional, com organização complexa e dinâmica de seus componentes. Ainda, cada indivíduo interage de forma diferente ao ambiente e, por isso, inteligência, interesses, realização pessoal, felicidade e valores pessoais são importantes para a avaliação. Dessa forma, a QdV é entendida como um aspecto fundamental para possuir uma boa saúde e não o contrário. Além dos aspectos subjetivos, a abordagem holística também busca avaliar os aspectos objetivos como a satisf ação das necessidades básicas e o desenvolvimento econômico e social de determinada sociedade. Dentre tantas definições existentes sobre a QdV, não há uma definição que seja amplamente aceita. Entretanto, é possível perceber que ao se avaliar a QdV, é nece ssário incluir diversos fatores, e não somente os fatores relacionados à saúde, como bem -estar físico, emocional e mental. Os fatores objetivos, como trabalho, família e amigos, e os fatores subjetivos difíceis de serem compreendidos, como felicidade, amor e sentimentos, também possuem grande importância na avaliação.", "Dessa forma, os conceitos de QdV mais aceitos são aqueles que buscam analisar uma multiplicidade de fatores. Assim, um conceito amplamente divulgado sobre a QdV é o cita do pela Organização Mundial de Saúde (OMS) , o qual entende por QdV a maneira pela qual cada indivíduo percebe sua posição na vida dentro do contexto da cultura e valores nos quais ele vive e em relação aos seus padrões, preocupações, objetivos e expectativ as (WHOQOL GROUP, 1995). A Qdv então, pode ser entendida como um conceito complexo e multidimensional que compreende indicadores objetivos e subjetivos (KEATING et al., 2012). E, segundo a OMS, deve ser baseado em seis domínios: domínio físico (sono, ener gia e dor), psicológico (sentimentos positivos e negativos, auto -estima e imagem corporal), grau de independência (mobilidade, atividades da vida cotidiana, dependência de medicação ou de tratamentos e capacidade de trabalho), relações sociais (relações pe ssoais, suporte social e atividade sexual), meio ambiente (segurança física, recursos financeiros, lazer, ambiente físico e cuidados de saúde e sociais) e religião (espiritualidade) (WHOQOL GROUP, 1995).", "1.3 Qualidade de vida na demência", "Na demência, a QdV envolve o funcionamento cognitivo, atividades da vida diária, interação social e bem -estar psicológico (W HITEHOUSE et al., 1997 ). Com o agravamento da demência e do declínio cognitivo e funcional, os cuidados são mais necessários e os cuidadores podem sen tir-se sobrecarregados, afetando assim, a estrutura social e funcional da família, além de comprometer a q ualidade de vida (QdV) de ambos (SIMONELLI et al., 2008, INOUYE et al., 2009, D OURADO et al., 2010). Assim, c om o avanço da demência, avaliar a QdV permite investigar os benefícios das intervenções tanto para portadores de DA, quanto para seus cuidadores (N OVELLI et al., 2010) . Diversos estudos sugerem que a QdV dos cuidadores de portadores de DA pode influenciar nos cuidados prestados ao parceiro com demência, e consequentemente a qualidade desse cuidado recebido pode afetar a QdV do portador de DA (S VETLIK et al., 2005; M OYLE et al., 2012; S OUSA et al., 2013). Para avaliar a QdV diferentes métodos são utilizados. Esses métodos podem ser por auto -avaliação, pela perspectiva dos cuidadores ou por modelos de observação de comportamento (L OGSDON et al., 1999; A LBERT et al., 2000; V OLICER et al., 2000). Estudos demonstraram que a auto -avaliação da QdV pelos portadores de DA pode ser influenciada pela gravi dade da doença, pelos sintomas neuropsiquiátricos, comprometimento cognitivo, e consciência da doença (L OGSDON et al., 1999; V OGEL et al., 2006 ), e por isso pode ter sua validade prejudicada pelos déficits (V OGEL et al., 2006). Normalmente, os portadores de demência avaliam sua QdV de forma estável, enquanto os cuidadores apresentam um declínio ao longo do avanço da doença ( CONDE - SALA et al ., 2013). O cuidador tende a subestimar a QdV do paciente, principalmente se possui sintomas de depressão, estresse e sobrecarga (VOGEL et al., 2006; B UCKLEY et al., 2012). Além disso, o s cuidadores consideram uma variedade de fatores, e podem ser influenciados pela percepção que possuem sobre o agravamento da doença (N OGUEIRA et al., 2014). Ademais, suas o bservações sobr e o humor do paciente são um componente crítico (L OGSDON et al., 2002; S OUSA et al., 2013). Ainda, a interpretação do que é importante na avaliação da QdV pode não possuir o mesmo significado para diferentes díades, mesmo quando são perguntadas as mesmas q uestões ( SOUSA et al., 2013). Entretanto, a pesar de diferentes, todas as avaliações são consideradas válidas perspectivas da QdV (SCHIFFCZYK et al., 2010).", "As diferenças entre as avaliações da díade podem ser explicadas porque a QdV pode sofrer modificação em diferentes níveis do comprometimento cognitivo (L OGSDON et al., 2002; B UCKLEY et al., 2012). Demonstrando assim, a importância de também ser considerada a auto-avaliação dos portadores de DA (N OGUEIRA et al., 2014). Além disso, a auto -avalia ção é mantida para preservar e respeitar a autonomia do idoso com demência (SANTOS et al., 2014 ).", "Assim, apesar de avaliarem de forma distinta , pode -se concluir que a QdV dos cuidadores é relacionada a QdV dos idosos com demência (L OGSDON et al., 2002; C ONDE-SALA et al., 2009). Outros fatores que podem influenciar na QdV seriam as características da personalidade do cuidador, o tempo dedicado aos cuidados do idoso com demência, a gravidade da demência e a natureza da relação entre a díade (S CHIFFCZYK et al., 2010).", "1.3.1. Qualidade de vida e Sexualidade", "Os cônjuges cuidadores, quando comparados aos outros tipos de cuidadores de pessoas co DA, possuem uma relação mais próxima do paciente, e por isso, devem ser estudados como uma população específica (NOGUEIRA et al., 2014). Assim, com o avanço da demência, pode ocorrer uma queda na proximidade emocional, gerando percepção deteriorada da qualidade do relacionamento conjugal. Dessa forma, a QdV de casais onde um dos cônjuges seja portador de DA, assim c omo a qualidade do relacionamento conjugal , pode ser influenciada pelas possíveis falhas na comunicação entre o casal geradas pelo surgimento de déficits cognitivos e de personalidade. Sendo assim , a QdV está associada à uma melhor qualidade do relacioname nto conjugal (VUGT et al., 2003; CLARE et al., 2012) .", "As mudanças que ocorrem com a progressão da demência, podem ser percebidas de forma diferente por cada gênero. A qualidade do relacionamento conjugal para homens e mulheres é percebida de forma distinta , pois, pode ser influenciada pelo tipo de cuidado e a maneira de lidar emocionalmente com a doença ( CLARE et a., 2014). A DA é percebida de forma diferenciada por cada cônjuge, e assim, podem perceber o declínio no relacionamento de forma diferente ( VUGT et al., 2003, CLARE et al., 2012). As mulheres normalmente assumem os cuidados do cônjuge sozinhas e entram em conflito com os papéis assumidos de esposa, amante, mãe e cuidadora, o que pode gerar um maior risco de sobrecarga (DOURADO et al., 2010, DAVIES et al., 2010). Os cuidadores homens, por sua vez, dificilmente assumem o papel de cuidador sozinhos, recebendo ajuda de outros , o que permite que permaneçam enxergando suas esposas como parceiras sexuais por mais tempo e se preocupando mais com a presença de atividade sexual no relacionamento (DOURADO et al., 2010, SIMONELLI et al., 2008).", "Assim como a manutenção, a interrupção da atividade sexual também possui diferenças intergêneros. Para as esposas cuidadoras, manter a atividade sexual com um parceiro qu e não é capaz de reconhece -las é um dos principais motivos para a interrupção. Para os homens, suas companheiras precisam ser capazes de demonstrar interesse ou prazer, e a atividade seja consensu al. Contudo, a substituição da atividade sexual por contatos físicos, como beijos , abraços e toques é muito comum na progressão da doença, e preferência de ambos os sexos ( LITZ; ZEIS; DAVIES, 1990 ).", "Vale ressaltar que as relações do passado podem ser relatadas pelos portadores de DA como se fossem do presente. Dessa forma, eles se consideram sexualmente ativos, mesmo que o cônjuge saudável relate o oposto. Então, é possível que entre os casais, ocorra discordância sobre a satisfação e a atividade sexual (DOURADO et al., 2010). É importante perceber que uma boa qualidade no relacionamento conjugal, com a presença de algum tipo de intimidade, seja atividade sexual ou contato físico, como beijos e abraços , podem resultar em uma maior QdV entre o casal (SVETLIK et al.,", "1.4 Relevância", "Diversos estudos avaliam a QdV entre id osos com demência, incluindo cônjuges, filhos adultos, além de outros tipos de cuidadores (L OGSDON et al., 2002; C ONDE -SALA et al., 2009). Diferentes de outros tipos de cuidadores, os cônjuges -cuidadores , por causa de sua posição no relacionamento , tendem a ser mais próximos do portador de demência e investem por semana, dez vezes mais horas nos cuidados e possu em um menor número de pessoas ajudando nessa função (FITZPATRICK et al., 2010, NOGUEIRA et al., 2014). Ao avaliar a QdV entre casais os quais um dos cônjuges seja portador de DA, uma melhor QdV está associada à uma melhor qualidade do relacionamento conjugal entre o casal (C LARE et al., 2012). O agravamento dos déficits cognitivos, comportamentais e de personalidade podem resultar em uma dificuldade na comunicação entre o casal, gerando um declínio na qualidade da intimidade e possíveis problemas na relação conjugal ( VUGT et al., 2003; M ITTELMAN et al., 200 3). Dessa forma, todas as áreas do relacionamento sofrem prejuízo e assim, os cônjuges -cuidadores tendem a idealizar o relacionamento anterior quando confrontados com os problemas atuais (V UGT et al. , 2003). Ainda, as mudanças ocorridas no relacionamento são percebidas de forma diferente por cada cônjuge (N OGUEIRA et al., 2014), mas comumente possuem impacto na sobrecarga e depressão dos cônjuges -cuidadores (V UGT et al., 2003). Segundo Fitzpatrick et al. (2010), o declí nio cognitivo é correlacionado à sobrecarga devido a depressão, a mudanças no comportamento, ao declínio da funcionalidade e a o conseq uente afastamento conjugal.", "O declínio na qualidade do relacionamento conjugal também é associado aos sintomas neuropsiquiátricos, especialmente à presença de apatia no idoso com demência . A apatia pode ser responsável pela diminuição de elementos essenciais na relação conjugal como as atividades em conjunto e o compartilhamento de experiências (VUGT et al., 2003) . Dessa forma, pode ocorrer um declínio na proximidade emocional, se comparado ao estágio anterior do relacionamento conjugal (F ITZPATRICK et al., 2010). Apesar disso, o declínio na qualidade do relacionamento pode apresentar também experiênc ias positivas. Com o aumento de dificuldade na funcionalidade, os cônjuges -cuidadores sentem empatia pelo seu parceiro e assim, desejam protegê -lo. Dessa forma, eles se aproximam do parceiro enquanto as interações diárias tornam -se mais difíceis (V UGT et al., 2003). Outro aspecto importante a ser observado é a diferença intergêneros. Homens e mulheres percebem de forma di stinta a tarefa de cuidar e a maneira de lidar emocionalmente com a doença (C LARE et al., 2012). Cônjuges - cuidadores do sexo masculino po ssuem menores nív eis de depressão se comparados à s esposas cuidadoras (F ITZPATRICK et al., 2010). Se analisados perante a questão da intimidade, as cônjuges -cuidadoras apresentam maior dificuldade em lidar com a combinação entre os papéis assumidos de cuidadora, mãe, esposa e amante e pas sam a enxergar a sexualidade com baixa prioridade . Os homens nor malmente não assumem os cuidados sozinhos, preservando a sua posição como marido e assim, permitindo que enxerguem suas esposas como parceiras sexuais por mais tempo (N OGUEIRA Sendo assim, o estudo da QdV de casais nos quais um dos cônjuges seja portador de DA torna -se importante para avaliar de que forma esse grupo específico avalia as diferenças no relacionamento e de que forma a progressão da demência pode interferir em suas vidas diárias. Dessa forma, estratégias de intervenção não farma cológicas específicas podem ser desenvolvidas para ajudar a maximizar a QdV e a satisfação com a relação matrimonial. Assim, esse estudo tem como objetivo pautar algumas questões:", "(1) Com a progressão da DA, os casais sofrem maior declínio na QdV?

We investigated the perception of change and sexual satisfaction in spouse -caregivers and their partners diagnosed with AD. Methods: We compared 74 dyads of peopl e with Alzheimer´s disease (PwAD)/spouse -caregivers and 21 elderly dyads control. We assessed sexual satisfaction with Questionnaire on Sexual Experience and Satisfaction (QSES), cognition using a Mini -Mental State Examination (MMSE), disease severity using a Clinical Dementia Rating scale (CDR), awareness of disease with Assessment Scale of Psychosocial Impact of the Diagnosis of Dementia (ASPIDD), functionality with Pfeffer Functional Activities Questionnaire (FAQ), depressive symptoms with Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia (CSDD), quality of life using a Quality of Life in Alzheimer’s Disease Scale (QoL -AD) and burden using a Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI).", "Results: We found differences between the perception and no perception of change in sexual ac tivity of PwAD (p<0.001), spouse -caregivers (p<0.01) and controls (p<0.05) .

Spouse -caregivers sexual satisfaction was related to gender (p<0.05) and the presence of sexual activity (p<0.001).", "Conclusions: The perception of change with higher sexual dissatisfaction, were significant in PwAD and their spouse -caregivers, i n comparison with couples of elderly without dementia. Key words: sexual activity, sexual satisfaction, Alzheimer’s disease, spouse - caregiver, cognition, elderly .", "Introduction Sexuality in later life has several myths and socio -cultural stereotypes, especially when couples are composed by one spouse with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) ( DeLamater and Karraker, 2009; Mahieu et al., 2014). Although the onset of AD results in cognitive decline, and affects all d imensions of couples’ relationship ( Simonelli, et al. , 2008; Hayes et al., 2009; Davies et al. , 2010 ), it does not mean diminished sexual desire ( Alagiakrishnan et al. , 2005). AD progression is often followed by decrease in sexual activity, but sexual inte rest and ability to enjoy sex may not disappear automatically (Tsatali et al ., 2010). Byers (2005) showed that sexual satisfaction and relationship satisfaction change together, resulting from changes in intimate communication between partners.", "The sexual/ intimacy dynamic in relationship has to accommodate people with AD (PwAD) functional and cognitive deficits (Davies et al., 2012; Nogueira et al., 2013). The spouse -caregiver’s interest in being sexually intimate may be affected by PwAD decreased competency to consent and physical vulnerability (Mahieu et al. , 2014). PwAD may exhibit inappropriate sexual behavior, or may not be able to remember wh at to do during sexual intercourse, leading spouse - caregivers to have feelings of rejection and, decreasing sexual activity (Nogueira et al ., 2014). Nevertheless, depression, anxiety and medical conditions may be responsible for PwAD less interest in sexua l activity (Davies et al., 2012). Spouse -caregivers’ satisfaction in intimacy does not depend only on the degree of PwAD physical and cognitive impairment, but also on the level of anxiety and burden of caring ( Svetlik et al., 2005; Davies et al., 2012). Davies et al. (2010) emphasize the impact of the regression into parent - child relations in the couple´s intimacy, emotional and sexual relationship. Negative changes in the marital relationship are associated to the decreased happiness, equal relations, an d people with dementia’s expressions of sexual needs when compared to the time before the diagnosis ( Eloniemi -Sulkava et al., 2002) . In addition, the physical intimacy is perceived as a relationship loss, especially with the increase of the activities of d aily living (ADL) assistance (Svetlik et al., 2005).", "There is a general consensus that sexuality compromised to some degree in a proportion of PwAD and spouse -caregiver dyads. However, the perceptions held by the PwAD about the changes in their marital li fe are not clear. Recently, a systematic review (Nogueira et al., 2013) found only two studies which include PwAD self -reports about the change in perceive sexuality (Wright et al. , 1998; Dourado et al., 2010). Wright et al., (1998) showed the longitudina l decline of the expressions of affection for all members of the couples after the onset of dementia, indicating that physical and emotional health of both partners influence the sexual relationship. Most recently, Dourado et al., (2010) found that both pa rtners of the couple demonstrated sexual dissatisfaction. Thus, the investigation of sexual satisfaction and the perception of changes in sexuality in couples with a partner with AD is commonly focused only on spouse -caregivers’ observation. Although the perspectives of sexuality provided by PwAD may be uncertain, they are still valid to understand the quality of the relationship. In this context, this study aims to investigate (1) the perception of change in sexual activity and sexual satisfaction in spou se- caregivers and their partners diagnosed with AD and (2) the influence of clinical characteristics of PwAD and their spouse -caregivers in their sexual satisfaction. We hypothesized that PwAD perception of change of sexual activity is lower than their spo use-caregivers’ and control group (CG). We also assumed that spouse -caregivers may experience lower levels of sexual satisfaction than PwAD and dyads without dementia.", "Methods We included couples whose spouses were diagnosed with probable AD (n=74) according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (American Psychiatric Association, 2000) and elderly couples without dementia (n=21) as a CG. PwAD attended an outpatient clinic for routine follow -up appointments in the Center for Alzheimer’s Disease at Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, and they were consecutively selected, according to the psychiatrists’ referrals, from January 2012 to September 2015. In order to ensure the findings were applicable for AD rather than o ther clinical problems, people with head trauma, aphasia, history of alcoholism, psychotic symptoms, epilepsy and uncontrolled medical problems such as hypertension, depression and diabetes were excluded from the study. All PwAD were able to read and write simple sentences, interact with the interviewer and understand the commands. The clinical diagnosis of AD was based on a clinical interview with the PwAD and spouse -caregivers, cognitive screening tests, laboratory tests and imaging studies. Only individu als with MMSE scores of 13 -26 and classified as Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) 1 or 2 according to the summed score were included in the study.", "All spouse -caregivers had been previously informed of the diagnosis by the psychiatrist. We interviewed all spou se-caregivers in order to exclude who reported history of psychiatric or cognitive disorders to ensure that the findings were not biased by caregivers’ clinical problems . After the reported story of their health condition all spouse -caregivers were conside red acceptable for inclusion in the study.", "The PwAD completed assessments about sexual satisfaction, quality of life (QoL), cognition and their awareness of disease. The spouse -caregivers provided information about the PwAD (demographics, ability to perform ADLs, depressive symptoms, and dementia severity) and had their QoL, sexual satisfaction and burden assessed.", "The CG was composed by couples selected in different physical activity clubs in the same area of the outpatient clinic, without uncontroll ed clinical problems and with the minimum age of 60 years old. The couples were individually interviewed from January 2013 to July 2015. When one of the spouses presented cognitive impairment, the couple was excluded from the CG. All partners had their sex ual satisfaction and cognition independently assessed. This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Institute of Psychiatry of the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro and all PwAD, spouse - caregivers and CG participants received a full descriptio n of the study and signed informed consent forms prior to the interview.", "Measures We used the Brazilian adaptation of all instruments. All procedures were applied with the same technique and sequence by trained researchers. PwAD Measurements Sexual Satisfaction . The primary outcome was the Questionnaire on Sexual Experience and Satisfaction (QSES), which examines sexual satisfaction by determining the presence of sexual dysfunction in the last four weeks, with a score ranging from 14 to 84. Scores be low 35 indicate normal sexual behavior and satisfaction; scores between 36 and 58 denote mild to moderate dissatisfaction; scores greater than 59 indicate moderate to severe dissatisfaction. Additionally, there are yes/no questions about the presence and perception of any recent change in sexual activity. Also, there is a question about sexual activity, and we considered how each person understands the presence of it (with or without intercourse). The participants' orally answered the questions and the inte rviewers filled in the QSES register form. The dyads were interviewed separately to exclude interference between partners. The questionnaire was validated for people with cognitive disorders and presents the sensitivity and specificity of 91.3% and 55.6% respectively (Abdo and Oliveira, 2004) .", "Quality of Life. We used the self -report version of the Quality of Life in Alzheimer’s Disease Scale ( QoL-AD). The 13 domains (physical health, energy, mood, living situation, memory, family, marriage, friends, chore s, fun, money, self and life as whole) are rated as poor (1), fair (2), good (3) or excellent (4), and the total score ranges from 13 to 52 (Novelli et al., 2010). Cognition. We applied the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), a cognitive screening test. The score ranges from 0 to 30, and lower scores indicate impaired cognition (Bertolucci et al., 1994).", "Dementia Severity. The severity of AD was measured with Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR), with stages ranging from 0 (no dementia) to 3 (severe dementia) . We used the full protocol (Maia et al., 2006).", "Awareness of disease. We applied the Assessment Scale of Psychosocial Impact of the Diagnosis of Dementia (ASPIDD). The scale assesses discrepancies between PwAD and caregiver’s reports about awareness of cognitive deficits, social relationships, family relationships, instrumental and basic ADL. The 30 -question ratings range from preserved, mildly impaired, moderately impaired to absent awareness of disease (D ourado Activities of Daily Living. We applied the Pfeffer Functional Activities Questionnaire (FAQ). The total score is 30 and each item ranges from 0 (normal) to 3 (dependent). Higher scores indicate worse functional status (Nitrini Depressive Symptoms. PwAD mood was measured with Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia (CSDD). The total score is 38 and a cut -off score of 13 indicates the presence of depression (Portugal et al., 2012).", "Spouse -caregivers’ Measurements Sexual Satisfaction. Spouse -caregivers independently answered the QSES, the same scale used to measure PwAD sexual satisfaction (Abdo and Oliveira, 2004).", "Quality of Life. This is the same scale used to assess the PwAD QoL, but we used the caregiver self -reported version (Novelli et al., 2010). Burden.

The parametric variables were described by their mean and standard deviations (SD). The non -parametric variables were described by the percentage of the highest option.", "The Levene test was used to verify the homosce dasticity b etween the variances. The Chi -square and Exact Fisher test were used to assess the differences on the change in sexual activity between PwAD, spouse -caregivers and CG. The Student’s T test assessed the differences between PwAD, spouse - caregivers’ and control group’s sexual satisfaction and perception of chang e in sexual activity ratings. We used the one -way ANOVA to analyze the variance of ASPIDD ratings, because the variable was considered as ordinal and the domains of ASPIDD independent. Matrices of Pearson’s correlations were created to investigate the corr elations between the sexual satisfaction of PwAD, their spouse -caregivers and CG and change in sexual activity, age, disease duration, educational level, gender, cognitive function, presence of depressive symptoms, functional activities, burden and QoL. To control for family wise error rate, only results with p≤0.001 were considered significant. Differences between both groups (perception and no perception of change) in relation to clinical variables were analyzed by means of the Chi - squared test. Predictiv e factors related to the dichotomous variable (perception vs. no perception of change) were identified by means of a binary logistic regression analysis.", "We performed two binary logistic regression analyses in order to identify the factors related to the s exual satisfaction of the PwAD and spouse - caregivers. The linear regression was conducted only with the variables that were significantly correlated to sexual satisfaction. Models were run separately for PwAD and spouse -caregivers.

We found that the perception of change and consequent interruption of sexual activ ity, with higher sexual dissatisfaction, were higher in PwAD and their spouse -caregivers, in comparison with elderly couples without dementia. Decreased sexual activity and sexual indifference are the most common sexual behavior changes in couples after th e onset of dementia (Mahieu et al. , 2014; Eloniemi -Sulkava et al. , 2002 ), because cognitive impairment may pose particular challenges in terms of loss of physical intimacy and overall relationship quality. Loss of intimacy is related to feelings of loss and emotional burden caused by the need to care for PwAD in daily activities and changes in their personality due to memory impairment as well as some behavioral symptoms (Svetlik et al., 2005) .", "Our findings are in agreement with the literature and support the conclusion that spouse -caregivers experience lower levels of sexual satisfaction than PwAD and elderly couples without dementia ( Eloniemi -Sulkava et al. , 2002; Simonelli et al., 2008). We also found that gender differences played a role in spouse -caregivers’ sexual satisfaction. For future research these differences should be further investigated, because sexual satisfaction in AD may be associated with gender and the role of caregiving (Davies et al., 2012; Nogueira et al ., 2013). Female spouse -caregi vers assume different familiar tasks such as being wife, mother and lover. This may cause conflict between roles and decrease sexual activity. The relationship may regress into parent - child relationship, and the healthy spouse may feel the sexual activity as ‘incestuous’ (Baikie, 2002) or it may be low priority (Nogueira et al., 2014). This negative change affects both emotional and sexual dimensions of the relationship (Davies et al., 2010). Male spouse -caregivers commonly receive help from others on the c aregiving tasks, and, thus, they usually maintain sexual intimacy (Baikie, 2002; Simonelli et al., 2008; Hayes et al., 2009; Nogueira et al., 2014) . Moreover, male spouse -caregivers are commonly engaged in sexual activity with their spouses, but interrupt it when she becomes unable to consent (Hayes et al., 2009; Mahieu et al., 2014). Conversely, female spouse -caregivers only continue sexual intercourse with PwAD if they are able to recognize them (Nogueira et al., 2013). Furthermore, they are more likely t o replace their sexual activity for caring of PwAD and affective aspects of the relationship than the male counterparts (Mahieu et al.,2014).", "The presence of sexual activity was related with sexual satisfaction; however, we did not investigate if all form s of intimacy between couples were considered as a sexual activity. Sexuality is often misunderstood; social and cultural values place a substantial amount of emphasis on sexual intercourse, reducing sexuality to acts of sexual expression – the observable manifestations of sexual activity and desire (Dourado et al ., 2010). Some studies have documented that the non -intercourse intimacy, like kissing, hugging, cuddling, and other forms of physical contact might also be considered as sexual activity in dementi a (Davies et al., 2012; Nogueira et al., 2013). However, poorer health and cognitive impairment may result in less interest in sexual activities and decreased satisfaction, especially if the couples perceive that their relationships are not psychologically and emotionally secure (Svetlik et al., 2005). T o better understand the age -related knowledge about sex, further studies should investigate the differences in meanings and concepts of sexual activity and sexual satisfaction in distinct ages of onset of dementia.", "Our findings showed that PwAD perception of change in their sexual activity was related to dementia severity, and the sexual satisfaction was related to cognitive impairment. Frequently, cognitive deficits , dementia severity, neuropsychiatric sym ptoms, and awareness of disease have been considered as the main factors that influence PwAD self -report ratings (Sousa et al., 2013) . Our data showed that PwAD related more sexual activity than their spouse - caregivers, suggesting that the cognitive impair ment may interfere in the perception of change and presence of sexual activity. A longitudinal investigation may be necessary to evaluate the increase of cognitive impairment and the consequences in sexual satisfaction over the progression of dementia. Our study has some limitations. First, we did not assess spouse -caregivers cognitive status with a screening instrument. We used only a self -reported story . Further studies should compare cognitive status of dyads with and without dementia measured with a mor e formal evaluation. Second, although the Questionnaire on Sexual Experience and Satisfaction (QSES) was validated for people with cognitive disorders, and was used in previous study with PwAD (Dourado et al., 2010), it reports only symptoms and signs of s exual dysfunction as variables to analyse sexual satisfaction. A more detailed assessment tool would be necessary to better understand qualitative causes of sexual dissatisfaction in couples with dementia. Third, spouse -caregivers´ burden scores were gener ally low. This may be explained because all spouse - caregivers and PwAD attended an outpatient clinic, and they had information about the disease and adequate treatment. There is substantial evidence that changes in sexual activity and sexual satisfaction a re related to distress and caregiver burden (Davies et al., 2012). Additionally, we did not assess PwAD neuropsychiatric symptoms. Further studies should investigate the relationship between perception of change in sexual activity, sexual satisfaction and PwAD neuropsychiatric symptoms.", "Interestingly, PwAD sexual satisfaction is related to the level of cognitive impairment and spouse -caregivers’ sexual satisfaction depends on gender and presence of sexual activity. No PwAD variables were related with spouse - caregivers’ sexual satisfaction or vice versa. Although it is still unclear whether sexual dissatisfaction improves emotional distress, this study is helpful for the expansion of the investigation of couples’ relationship after the onset of dementia and t he development of strategies to increase the well -being of the couple. Evidence -based interventions, as psychotherapy or psychoeducational groups, may help to develop coping strategies to improve couples’ relationship. For example, techniques encouraging a dialogue between the dyad and including sexual relationship as part of that would be beneficial to them. The preservation of the sexual intimacy can be an important dimension in the marriage and maintain the feeling of being a couple.", "Conflict of interest None", "Description of authors’ roles M. M.

Therefore, we designed this study to compare the differences in caregivers’ quality of life (QoL) and domains of QoL according to the kinship between dyads.", "Methods: We assessed QoL of 98 PwAD and their family caregivers (N=49 spouse -caregivers; N=43 adult children; N=6 others ). The PwAD and their caregivers completed questionna ires about their QoL , awareness of disease, cognition, severity of dementia, depression and burden of caring. Results: The comparison between caregivers’ groups showed that spouse - caregivers were older, with higher levels of burden, and lower score for cognition . The total score of caregivers’ QoL showed no significant difference according to the degree of kinship. There was a significant difference in domains for physical health (p=0.04, d= -0.42), marriage (p =0.01, d=1.31), friends When the domains of QoL were analyzed between dyads , there was a significant difference in domains for energy (p= 0.01, d= -0.49), ability to do things for fun (p= 0.01, d= -0.48) and memory (p=0.000, d= -1.07) for spouse dyads, and a significant difference in QoL domains for memory (p=0.004, d= - chores (p=0.000, d= -0.76) for non -spouse dya ds. Conclusions: The differences between the spouse and non -spouse only appeared when QoL was analyzed by domains. Spouse and non -spouse caregivers have specific assessment and perceptions about what is important to QoL.", "Keywords: Quality of life, kindship, caregivers, spouse -caregiver, Alzheimer’s Disease", "Introduction In Alzheimer’s disease (AD), depression, anxiety and stress are common among caregivers. Thus, several studies have investigated how these factors affect caregivers’ quality of life (QoL) and burden, but commonly include different types of caregivers, as spouse, adult children and oth er relatives1,2. A question relies on the differences of caregiver’s point of view in QoL changes according to the degree of kinship.", "A meta -analysis comparing different types of caregivers, showed that because of the closer relationship with the PwAD, adult children caregivers report more depression and psychological distress of caring when compared to children -in-law caregivers3. Moreover, caregivers who lived at the same home with the PwAD had lower QoL compared with those who did not4.", "In AD, when sp ouse -caregivers are compared to other kinships, they often feel more responsible for the caring activities and, consequently, present higher risk of burden and depression3. Spouse -caregivers perceived their role more stressful when compared with non -spouse -caregivers5, and this may influence the evaluation of QoL. Although each member of the couple experience different extents of decline in the relationship, t his data may be explained by the amount of hours of caring, the change in intimacy, and the commonl y older age3,6. Furthermore, the relationship may be influenced for changes in sexual activity. Commonly, PwAD may not be able to remember what to do during sexual intercourse and/or exhibit inappropriate sexual behavior and consequently, the spouse -caregi ver may present feelings of rejection7. Thus, the level of intimacy of the dyad spouse -caregivers/PwAD may influence QoL differently. If a spouse -caregiver perceives the relationship as less distressful, the quality of provided care will be higher, resulti ng in higher QoL of the couple6. As a result, the quality of the marital relationship may be associated to QoL8. So, perceived change in relationship was seen to be an important determinant of carer QoL4.", "Therefore, QoL is a complex and multidimensional concept that comprises subjective and objective indicators, as interpersonal relationships, family relationship, levels of chronic illness, housing and feeling valued6,9. In dementia its includes four general domains: cognitive functioning, activities of d aily living, social interaction and psychological well -being9. According Novelli et al.10, the importance of evaluate QoL is to assess which interventions benefit PwAD and their caregivers across the progression of the disease. On the other hand, the interpretation of what is important to evaluate QoL may not have the same mean for different kinds of caregivers and PwAD, even when are asked the same questions11. So, to better understand the influence of the type of relationship in QoL and their domains, we decided to compare the differences in caregivers’ point of view according to the degree of kinship between dyads . In this context, this study aims (1) to compare the influence of different kinships in the ratings of the caregivers’ self -report domains of Q oL (2) to compare the differences between PwAD self -report domains of QoL and caregivers self -report domains of QoL according to the degree of kinship. We hypothesized that QoL in spouse - caregiver are lower than in non -spouse -caregiver dyads.", "Methods Participants The sample consisted of PwAD (N=98; 43 males) diagnosed with AD according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition12 and their family caregivers (N=49 spouse -caregivers; N=43 adult children; N=6 others). The PwAD attended the outpatient clinic in the city of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, for routine follow -up appointments, and they were consecutively selected according to the psychiatris t, from January 2016 to May 2018 . In order to ensure the findings were applicab le to AD rather than other neurological problems, PwAD with head trauma, aphasia, history of alcoholism and psychiatric disorders and epilepsy were excluded from the study. All PwAD were able to read and write simple sentences, interact with the interviewe r, and understand the commands. The clinical diagnosis of AD was based on a clinical interview with the PwAD and caregiver, cognitive screening tests, laboratory tests, and imaging studies. Only individuals with Mini–Mental State Examination ( MMSE )13 score s of 13 –26 and classified as Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR)14 1 or 2 according to the summed score were included in the study.", "We considered as non -spouse caregivers only informal caregivers (i.e., family members), and the main person responsible for the P wAD care. The non - spouse caregivers should have meetings at least once to twice a week, in order to be able to express judgments on actual daily life behaviors and failures. We excluded caregivers with a reported history of psychiatric or cognitive disorde rs. Only individuals with MMSE scores of 28 -30 were included in the study. The caregivers were able to provide detailed information about their care recipients. All of the caregivers had been previously informed of the diagnosis by the psychiatrist. Each P wAD and caregiver pair was separately interviewed. The PwAD completed assessments about QoL, cognition and their awareness of disease. The caregiver provided information about the PwAD (including demographics, depressive symptoms, and dementia severity), their QoL, and burden of care were assessed.", "This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Institute of Psychiatry of the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, and all of the PwAD and caregivers received a full description of the study and signed informed consent forms prior to the first interview.", "Measures We used the Brazilian adapted and validated version of all instruments. All procedures were applied with the same technique and sequence by trained researchers.", "PwAD’ s measurements Quality of life. The primary outcome was QoL measured by the Quality of Life in Alzheimer’s Disease Scale (QoL -AD). We used the self -report version of the scale (QoL PwAD). The scale evaluates 13 specific domains (physical, health, energy, mood, living situation, me mory, family, marriage, friends, chores, fun, money, self, and life as whole) are rated as (1) poor, (2) fair, (3) good, (4) or excellent. The total score ranges from 13 to 52, with higher scores indicating higher QoL10.", "Cognition. The MMSE was used to mea sure the cognitive function and orientation, registration, language use, short -term memory, and basic motor skills. The total score ranges from 0 to 30, with lower scores indicating a poor performance13.", "Dementia Severity . We used the CDR scale to measure the severity of AD, with stages ranging from 0 (no dementia) to 3 (severe dementia) according to cognitive, behavioral and ADL impairment. We used the full protocol14. Awareness of disease. The Assessment Scale of Psychosocial Impact of the Diagnosis of D ementia (ASPIDD) is a 30 -question scale based on the reports of PwAD and their caregivers. This scale was designed to evaluate awareness of disease by scoring discrepant responses across domains that include cognitive functioning and health condition, acti vities of daily living, emotional state, social functioning, and relationships. The caregiver answers the same questions as the PwAD. The score is based on the degree of discrepancy between the PwAD and caregiver dyad responses, with one point being scored for each discrepant response. The awareness ratings range from preserved (0 –4), mildly impaired (5 –11), moderately impaired (12 –17), to absent Depressive Symptoms. The Cornell Scale Depression Dementia (CSDD) was used to measure PwAD circadia n functions, physical, mood, and behavioral symptoms. The total score is 38 and a cut -off score of 13 indicates the presence of depression16.", "Caregivers’ measurements Quality of life. The same scale used to assess the PwAD’s QoL, was completed by caregiver s (QoL C)10.", "Cognition. This the same scale (MMSE) used to assess the PwAD cognition, but only individual with score between 28 -30 were included13. Burden. The Zarit Burden Interview were used to measure caregiver burden. The 22 direct and closed questions assess the impact of the illness on the caregiver’s life. The score ranges from 0 (no burden) to 88 (high burden)17.", "Statistical Methods All data and statistical analyses were per formed with SPSS software for Windows release 21.0. The clinical and sociodemographic characteristics of PwAD and caregivers were analyzed with descriptive statistics. The parametric variables were described by their mean and standard deviations (SD). The non- parametric variables were described by the percentage of the highest option. The Levene test was used to verify the homoscedasticity between the variances. The Chi -squared and Exact Fischer test were used to assess the differences on gender and educati onal level. The Mann -Whitney U test and Kruskal Wallis test were used to verify the heterogeneity between the variances. The paired Student’s t test was used to assess the differences between the dyads ratings of QoL (physical health, energy, mood, living situation, memory, family, marriage, friends, chores, fun, money, self, and life as a whole). We used the Cohen´s d to measure effect size when the comparison of two means in the domains of the QoL -AD scale revealed significant differences. The values indicated weak (< 0.5), moderate (0.5 - 0.8), or high (> 0.8) effects. All significance tests were performed at a two -tailed α level of ≤0.05. Results Description of the sample The spouse -PwAD mean age was 75.9 years (SD=8.1) and 77.9 years (SD=5.7) for non-spouse PwAD. The mean age of caregivers was 69.1 years (SD=10.1) for spouse -caregivers and 50.8 years (SD= 9.5) for non -spouse caregivers. For non -spouse caregivers the majority of kindship was adult child (88%, N= 43). The sociodemographic data of dya ds are provided in Table 1. (Insert Table 1) Clinical data PwAD The majority of PwAD showed mild disease severity, with 67% (N=33; 19 male) of spouse -PwAD, and 67% (N=33; 4 male) for non -spouse -PwAD. The awareness of disease of 24% (N=12) of spouse -PwAD was preserved, and 16.5% (N=8) for non -spouse PwAD; a mildly impaired awareness was showed for 43% (N=21) of spouse -PwAD and 63.5% (N= 31) of non -spouse -PwAD. A moderately impaired awareness was showed for 23% (N=11) and 20% (N=10) of non -spouse PwAD. Also , 10% (N=5) of spouse - PwAD showed unaware of their disease. The total score was 9.3 (SD=6.0) for spouse -PwAD and 8.5 (SD=3.4) for non -spouse -PwAD (p=0.40; d=0.17). Caregivers There were significant differences between spouse and non -spouse caregivers in co gnition (p=0.01; d= -0.90) and burden (p=0.02, d=0.60 ). Non - spouse caregivers showed a higher score for cognition, and lower score for burden.", "Clinical characteristics of PwAD and caregivers are shown in table 1. Quality of life Differences between self -report caregivers’ domains of QoL according to the degree of kinship The total score of caregivers’ QoL was 36.4 (SD=5.1 – range 31.3 – 41.5) for spouse -caregivers and 36.7 (SD=6.6 – range 30.1 – 43.3) for non -spouse - caregivers. The non -spouse -caregivers showed a slightly higher QoL than spouse -caregivers, however, the diff erence was not statistically significant in QoL total score between groups of caregivers (p=0.65, d= -0.05). Otherwise, there was a significant difference in QoL domains for marriage (p=0.01, d=1.31), as expected, with large effect size , and physical health (p=0.04, d= -0.42), friends (p=0.04, d= -0.41), and a trend for life as a whole (p=0.08, d= -0.33) with small effect sizes.", "Differences between self -report PwAD and self -report caregivers’ ratings of QoL There was a significant difference between spouse -PwAD and spouse - caregivers self -report QoL (p=0.01, d= --0.40), with small effect size .

The differences in QoL domains and total score are shown in tables 2 and 3.", "(Insert Table 2) (Insert Table 3) Discussion This study investigated the QoL of PwAD and caregivers, analyzing the influence of different types of kinship in self -report rating s. Commonly, studies that investigate QoL between PwAD and their caregivers, includes several kinds of caregivers, as spouse, adult children and other relatives, and do not take into consideration the differences related to the kinship as a whole1,2. Thus, we decided to compare different distinct groups of kinship in the dyads of PwAD/caregiver to better understand its influence in QoL ratings and domains. Differences between self -report caregivers’ domains of QoL according to the degree of kinship The comparison of the clinical and sociodemographic characteristics of the caregivers’ groups showed that spouse -caregivers were older, with higher levels of burden. Fauth et al .18 reported that the emotional closeness has an impact on caregiver well -being and, consequently on the type of care provided. Overall, spouse -caregivers, especially female spouse -caregivers, may consider the tasks of caring as part of their marital commitment, and commonly assume caring without help. Consequently, the caregiving r outine may regress the marital intimacy into a parent -child relationship. Having in mind that the relationship between spouses is closer, spouse -caregivers may be more overwhelmed by the change in their roles, and the change in the relationship may cause more burden of care7.", "We expected that spouse -caregivers showed lower QoL than non - spouse caregivers. The non -spouse -caregivers showed a slight higher QoL than spouse -caregivers, however, the difference was not statistically significant in QoL total score. However, when QoL was analyzed by domains, the non -spouse caregivers seemed to have more friends and perceived their own physical health better than spouse -caregivers. Non -spouse caregivers commonly receive help from others family members, and provide les s care than the spouse -caregiver, who are often the primary caregiver3. In addition, it is possible that because spouse -caregivers were older, it may have influenced the way they observed their physical health, once they are often frail themselves3. Studies have shown that better caregiver mental and physical health is consistently associated with better QoL4. This finding underlines the potential value of studying the differences in the caregivers’ groups in order to attend their needs effectively.", "Differences between self -report PwAD and self -report caregivers’ ratings of QoL The analysis of the total scores of QoL showed that self -report caregivers’ QoL was higher when compared to PwAD in both groups. Several studies reported higher QoL scores for PwAD when compared to caregivers’ scores, because of the presence of impaired awareness of disease6,19,20. Conversely, we found that both groups of caregivers had a better QoL compared to PwAD. The most likely explanation may be the fact that, our sample was selected in a specialized outpatient clinic that offers many services for caregivers, such as psychoeducational groups and physician appointment if necessary. According to Santos et al .20, the caregivers’ experiences of their subjective variables are more predictive than PwAD -related variables on self -report caregivers’ QoL. Furthermore, we may suppose that the clinical symptoms of AD were possibly not perceived as uncontrollable by the caregivers assessed in this study. Our sample of PwAD mostly showe d mild severity of disease and lower levels of depression, and caregivers’ QoL may be influenced by the existing context in each stage of the disease6.", "Furthermore, it has been suggested that social and interpersonal factors may play a stronger role that influence the evaluation of QoL21. Moreover, interpretation about QoL may be ambiguous when PwAD and caregivers are asked to answer the same questions. In our sample, we found that spouses differ in less domains of QoL than non -spouse dyads. The discrepancy between the spouse dyad was found in only two domains ( domains for energy and ability to do things for fun ), meanwhile, non -spouse dyads showed discrepancy in marriage, friends and ability to do chores. Also, all groups showed discrepancy for m emory, as expected. In that way, we may perceive that spouses, may become closer and develop mechanisms to cope with the difficulties together and the agreement about QoL are higher when compared with other kinds of caregivers. So, the closer relationship and feeling well supported in a relationship facilitates to evaluate the situation more positively and helps to adjust expectations21.", "Our study had some limitations. First, QoL was evaluated in a convenience sample of mild and moderate disease, and no an alysis to assess the differences of the two groups of disease severity was done. In future studies, the comparison of QoL between kinship of caregivers should be investigated in controlled studies by severity of dementia, because the ju dgments about what is important to evaluate QoL may change with the progress of dementia1. Second, even thought the burden was evaluated, no analysis to investigate the influence of burden in caregivers’ QoL was done. In our study, the majority of the sample had mild disease and maybe because of this, the caregiver burden was low. Commonly, caregivers with moderate levels of burden, experience difficulties that negatively affects their QoL11. In future studies, we should include more severe disease for further investigation be tween burden and QoL. Also, we should investigate the caregivers’ support and help from others family members. Receiving help may influence in how caregivers perceive the role of caring, and may influence their own QoL.", "Clinical Implications and future d irections QoL is a multidimensional concept associated with expectations, concerns and goals, including social, physical and psychological functioning. Because QoL is a complex concept, each group may evaluate differently. Our findings allow to answer whet her promoting specific service is recommended for each kind of kinship . Also, it would allow providers and clinicians to promote and maintain good QoL in PwAD and their caregivers taking into consideration the characteristic and demands of each group.", "Conclusion The investigation of spouse and non -spouse caregivers’ QoL did not show significant difference in QoL as a whole. On the other hand, when QoL was analyzed by domains, there were differences between the spouse and non - spouse caregivers’ groups. Our findings show that different group of caregivers have specific appraisals and perceptions regarding what is important to evaluate their own QoL. Even though both groups did not differ significantly when the QoL were globally evaluate, each group considered, as imp ortant, specifics domains to evaluate QoL. In that way, QoL is complex and should be evaluate by domains and not globally .", "Disclosure of interest The authors report no conflict of interest.", "Financial support This research received no specific grant from a ny funding agency, commercial or not -for-profit sectors.", "References 1.

In Alzheimers’ disease (AD), QoL includes four general domains: cognitive functioning, activities of daily living, social interaction and psychological well - being2. Moreover, the importance of assessments of QoL is to provide an information about interventions and whether they influenced in dyads’ life3. The perception of People with Alzheimer’s disease (PwAD) of their own QoL usually is influenced by depression, deficits of memory, judgment, communication and attention, and cognitive impairment may prevent them from making a reliable statement3-8. Moreover, for PwAD, relationships characterized by love, respect and kindness may increase their evaluation of QoL9. In that way, for PwAD the feeling of being accepted and loved for their partner may increase their well -being and their self perception of QoL. Furthermore, for PwAD, when caregiver is a spouse -caregiver, they believe the partner will evaluate PwAD QoL higher than non -spouse -caregivers10. Although the importance of self -report QoL of PwAD , the majority of studies prefer to use ratings of caregivers to assess QoL, and self-report of PwAD usually is evaluate only to compare with ratings of caregivers2-3,8,11 -12.", "Furthermore, s tudies investigating the agreement between self -rated and informant -rated QoL showed that PwAD rate their QoL higher when compared with caregivers or other informants11-12, raising questions about the level of agreement between self and carer ratings11. In addition, dementia progression does not necessarily imply in decreased QoL11-12. Also, higher level of burden, impairment on cognitive functioning and neuropsychiatric symptoms are associated with caregivers’ lower ratings about PwAD QoL3,13-14. Moreover, s tudies have shown that caregivers’ ratings may be influenced by the perceptions they have about PwAD QoL2,6,15 as they commonly underestimate the QoL when compared with PwAD ratings16. On the other hand, PwAD own ratings may remain stable over time5,7. Additionally, comparing different kinship of caregivers, spouse -caregivers may be more affected by changes in the relationship , reporting more depression symptoms and lower levels of psychological well -being17. Having in mind that the relatio nship between spouses is closer, spouse -caregivers may be more overwhelmed by the change in their roles, suffering more burden of care15.", "To better understand the influence of the type of relationship in QoL and their domains, we decided to compare the di fferences between spouse and non - spouse relationship. Thus, we decided to evaluate PwAD self -report domains of QoL comparing with their caregivers’ ratings of PwAD domains of QoL. Although AD may impact on PwAD ability to comprehend and communicate clearly their subjective state18, the evaluation of self -report PwAD QoL supports the concept of personhood and maintains the individuality throughout the AD progress. Moreover, we decided to compare QoL and its domains between spouse and non-spouses -dyads. In that way, the aim of this s tudy was (1) to compare whether there are differences in the spouse -PwAD and non-spouse PwAD self - report QoL , and (2) to evaluate whether being married differs in the discre pancy of ratings between spouse and non -spouse PwAD self-report QoL, and the spouse and non-spouse caregivers’ ratings of PwAD QoL . We hypothesized that QoL in spouse -PwAD might be higher than in non -spouse -PwAD . Methods Participants The sample consisted of PwAD (N=98; 43 males) diagnosed with AD according to the Diagnostic and Statist ical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition19 and their family caregivers (N=49 spouse -caregivers; N=43 adult children; N=6 others). Participants attended the outpatient clinic in the city of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, for routine follow -up appointments, and they were consecutively selected according to the psychiatrist, from January 2016 to May 2018. In order to ensure the findings were applicable to AD rather than other neurological problems, PwAD with head trauma, aphasia, history of alcoholism, psychot ic symptoms, epilepsy and uncontrolled medical problems such as hypertension, depression and diabetes were excluded from the study. The clinical diagnosis of AD was made by a psychiatrist based on a clinical interview with PwAD and caregiver, cognitive scr eening tests, laboratory tests, and imaging studies. All participants were able to read and write simple sentences, interact with the interviewer, and understand the commands. Only PwAD with Mini–Mental State Examination (MMSE )20 scores of 13 –26 and classified as Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR)21 1 or 2 according to the summed score were included in the study. We considered as non -spouse caregivers only informal caregivers (i.e., family members), and the main person responsible for the PwAD care. The n on- spouse caregivers should have meetings at least once to twice a week, in order to be able to express judgments on actual daily life behaviors and failures. We excluded caregivers with a reported history of psychiatric or cognitive disorders. Only indivi duals with MMSE scores of 28 -30 were included in the study. The caregivers were able to provide detailed information about their care recipients. All of the caregivers had been previously informed of the diagnosis by the psychiatrist. Each PwAD and caregiv er pair was separately interviewed. The PwAD completed assessments about QoL, cognition and their awareness of disease. The caregiver provided information about the PwAD (including demographics, activities of daily living, depressive symptoms, and dement ia severity), their QoL, cognition, depressive symptoms, anxiety and burden of care were assessed.", "This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Institute of Psychiatry of the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, and all of the PwAD and caregiver s received a full description of the study and signed informed consent forms prior to the first interview.", "Measures We used the Brazilian adaptation of all instruments.

The primary outcome was QoL measured by the Quality of Life in Alzheimer’s Disease Scale (QoL -AD). We used the self -report version of the scale (QoL PwAD), and the perspective of caregivers’ about PwAD’s QoL (QoL C-P). The 13 domains (physical, health, energy, mood, living situation, memory, family, marriage, friends, chores, fun, money, self, and life as whole) are rated as (1) poor, (2) fair, (3) good, (4) or excellent. The total score ranges from 13 to 52, with higher scores indicating higher QoL22.", "Cognition. Cognitive function and orientation, registration, language use, short -term memory, and basic motor skills were measured with MMSE with a score ranging from 0 to 30. Lower scores indicate impaired cognition23. Dementia Severity . We used the CDR scale to measure the severity of AD, with stages ranging from 0 (no dementia) to 3 (severe dementia) according to cognitive, behavioral and ADL impairment. We used the full protocol24. Activities of Daily Living (ADL). The basic and instrumental ADL were measured with the Pfeffer Functional Activities Questionnaire (P FAQ), a caregiver reported inventory with a score ranging from 0 (normal) to 3 (dependent), with a total of 30 points. Higher scores indicate worse functio nal status25.", "Awareness of disease. The Assessment Scale of Psychosocial Impact of the Diagnosis of Dementia (ASPIDD) is a 30 -question scale based on the reports of PwAD and their caregivers. This scale was designed to evaluate awareness of disease by scor ing discrepant responses across domains that include cognitive functioning and health condition, ADL, emotional state, social functioning, and relationships. The caregiver answers the same questions as the PwAD. The score is based on the degree of discrepa ncy between the PwAD and caregiver dyad responses, with one point being scored for each discrepant response. The awareness ratings range from preserved (0 –4), mildly impaired (5–11), moderately impaired (12 –17), to absent (over 18)26. Depressive Symptoms. PwAD circadian functions, physical, mood, and behavioral symptoms were measured with the Cornell Scale Depression Dementia (CSDD). The total score is 38 and a cut -off score of 13 indicates the presence of depression27.", "Caregivers’ measurements Quality of life. The same scale used to assess the PwAD’s QoL, was completed by caregivers (QoL C). Also, the caregivers answered about their perspective about PwAD’s QoL (QoL C -P)22.", "Cognition.

The Chi -squared and Exact Fischer test were used to assess the differences on dementia severity, gender and educational level. The Mann - Whitney U test and Kruskal Wallis test were used to verify the heterogeneity between the variances. The paired Stud ent’s t test was used to assess the differences between the dyads ratings of QoL (physical health, energy, mood, living situation, memory, family, marriage, friends, chores, fun, money, self, and life as a whole). We used the Cohen´s d to measure effect si ze when the comparison of two means in the domains of the QoL -AD scale revealed significant differences.

Commonly, PwAD QoL is assessed by ratings of their caregivers, but PwAD self -report ratings are valuable to compare with perspective of caregivers3,2,8, 11-12. Moreover, caregiver rate PwAD QoL lower than PwAD rate in a self-report11-12. Having in mind that self -report maintains the individuality and the concept of personhood, we decided to evaluate PwAD QoL from their own perspective and compared between different types of relationship (spouse and non -spouse).", "Differen ces between self -report PwAD QoL groups We expected that spouse -PwAD QoL was higher than non -spouse - PwAD QoL. Spouse -PwAD and non -spouse -PwAD did not show a significant difference in the total rating of QoL , a finding that lead us to reject our hypothesis. However , when the analysis was also performed by domains , we observed that the non -spouse PwAD group perceived their life as a whole and their self better than spouse -PwAD. The investigation of the domains of QoL showed that, although total QoL showed similar scores, the domains , which each group consider as important to evaluate their own QoL were not the same. Furthermore , spouse -PwAD QoL was related to awareness of disease. Logsdon et al.3 affirm that awareness of deficits increases with the decrease of functionality, and may have an impact on PwAD’s perceptions of their own QoL. Instead, non -spouse -PwAD QoL was negatively related to depression. The decreased in self -report PwAD QoL is freq uently associated to increase depression8,13. In our sample, we found two different explanations for QoL PwAD. Different kinds of PwAD evaluate their QoL in varied ways, and what is important to assess QoL of spouse -PwAD may not be important to non -spouse - PwAD. This finding may be explained by the different kind of relationship, because being with a partner and be part of a closer relationship, may result in an increase well -being. So, spouse -PwAD relate their own QoL to awareness of disease and non -spouse -PwAD related to depressive symptoms .", "Discrepancy of ratings between self -report PwAD and caregivers’ ratings of PwAD QoL We found that caregivers’ perception of PwAD QoL are lower than PwAD self-report QoL. The difference between self -report and caregiver s’ ratings of PwAD QoL (QoL C -P) as reported in the present study is in line with previous studies2,4-7,11-12,16. Sousa et al.6 affirm ed that the interpretation of QoL is subjective and PwAD and caregivers perceive differently, even if the same questions are asked . One possibly explanation for this difference is the fact that unawareness of disease may influence the self -report PwAD QoL . It is observed that PwAD with impaired awareness overestimate their own QoL5,8, maybe because they do not recognize the deficits or may deny the impairment 3,5,15. The analysis of the discrepancy between self -report PwAD and caregivers’ ratings of PwAD QoL by type of relationship showed that being married did not influence the total ratings of QoL. Spouse -caregivers perceived the domains of PwAD QoL for memory, friends, self as a whole, money, and life as a whole lower than non -spouse caregivers did. This fi nding may be related to differences between the standards for PwAD QoL fro m caregivers’ perspectives. May be spouse -caregivers based their judgments of PwAD QoL upon an appraisal of aspects of their own life which are considered detrimental: they are older, frail, more depressed, receive less support and predisposed to higher levels of burden with the caregiving routine.", "Furthermore, spouse -caregivers evaluate the depression of PwAD and burden of care related to caregivers’ ratings of PwAD QoL (QoL C -P). Th e literature affirms that PwAD mood has an important impact on QoL C -P7,13. Also, burden of care has an impact in perception of QoL C -P, since the stress of caretaking can impact negatively in the evaluation7,11, and, because of a closer relationship, spou se-caregivers may be more affected15. Instead, non -spouse - caregivers’ perception of QoL C -P is related to depression of PwAD, higher awareness of disease and the mood of them own. So, spouse and non -spouse caregivers evaluate from a different perspective t he QoL C -P. This different finding according kinship may be explained because burden of care, the nature of the relationship and the amount of time spent together may influence caregivers’ ratings of PwAD QoL6.", "Some limitations of this study must be acknow ledged. First, the majority of caregivers was female, and the gender may influence as female report more distress than male caregivers17. In future studies, the sample of caregivers should be controlled by gender. Second, a longitudinal investigation should be more accurate to evaluate QoL and the influence of the progression of the disease. Third, support and help from others family members should be investigated, because r eceiving help may influence in how caregivers perceive the role of caring, and may influence their own QoL. Although these limitations, our study found that focusing on different kinship, spouse and non -spouse - PwAD evaluate their own QoL in a diverse way. Even though there was not a significant difference in total QoL between both gr oups, the factors related to self-report QoL is not the same.

The couple may present feeling of loss in different areas of life and relationship. Semi -structured interviews were conducted to explore spouse -carer’s experiences with the progression of AD. Eleven care partners answered questions about their m arital relationship, sexual satisfaction and sexual activity. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of the onset of AD in spouse -carers’ life and how the progression of the illness affects the marital relationship. The data were analysed usin g interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA), and three themes emerged: Psychological and emotional impact, Social impact, and Sexual impact. The causes for changes in sexual activity varied among modifications of sexual activity before the onset of dementia because of aging or effects of the illness. Gender influenced the perception of change in marital relationship, but not with changes in sexual activity. These findi ngs would be helpful to provide better information about specificities of marital relationship of couples whose spouses were diagnosed with AD, and for development of methods for coping with the condition.", "Keywords: Spouse; carers; marital relationship; se xual activity; Alzheimers’ illness.", "Introduction The progression of dementia affects family carers and people living with Alzheimer’s Disease (PLWAD) lifestyle, especially when the dyad live together (Han & Radel, 2016 ). Carer and PLWAD may present feeling of loss in different areas of life and relationship. So, the dyad may develop strategies to cope with difficulties that dementia may bring, and try to keep control of emotions and changes that occur during the progression of the illness ( Wawrziczny , Antonie, Ducharme, Kergoat & Pasquier, 2016 ). In Alzheimer’s Disease (AD), if the carer is a spouse, he or she often feel more responsible for caring, and consequently, present higher risk of care burden and depression ( Pinquart, & Sörensen, 2011 ). It results in a regression of a marital relation into a parent -child relation (Pinquart, & Sörensen, 2011; Nogueira et al., 2016 ). At the same time that family carers try to maintain PLWAD self -esteem, they experience their own sense of self-being subsumed by the role of carer. Commonly, spouse -carers have feelings of guilt and self -criticism trying to manage their own needs and the needs of their partners (O’Shaughnessy, Lee, & Lintern, 2010). Furthermore, with the progression of dementia, the relationship may be adjusted to a committed dependent ( Nogueira et al., 2014 ), and this asymmetrical relationship impacts on the sense of couple hood and may affect the quality of intimacy and sexuality. T here are differences related to gender towards intimacy. Female spo use-carers commonly assume all the responsibility to provide care. So, assuming the role of spouse, mother and carer may affect the sexual desire. In contrast, male spouse -carers often receive help with care, and preserve the role of husband (Dourado, Fina more, Barroso, Santos & Laks, 2010; Nogueira et al., 2014 ).", "So, generally, the satisfaction with the relationship and the sexual satisfaction change together (Byers, 2005). Spouse -carers, who already perceived their relationship with poor intimacy and inte rpersonal problems before the illness, evaluate their relationship more negatively with the progression of dementia. Also, they experience more impact on the care provided and more severe perceived behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia (Wawrzi czny et al., 2016).", "Moreover, negative changes in the marital relationship are associated to couples’ decreased happiness (Eloniemi -Sulkava et al., 2002). The couple present an oscillation process between making sense of the situation and the acceptance of the changes that occur with the progression of dementia. They may feel lost and fear how the condition will evolve (O’Shaughnessy et al., 2010). For some spouse -carers, they fell pleasure to take care of PLWAD, and do not interpret it as an obligation, bu t as a continuation of a partner’s role. Otherwise, some spouse -carers perceive the provided care as an enforced togetherness that results in a sense of losing their privacy, and consequently, the may feel impacted by caring for a PLWAD (Waham, Simpson, Ru st & Thus, AD compromised to some degree the relationship between dyads, but it is not clear how couples deal with it. In a previous study ( Nogueira et al., 2016 ), we evaluated the sexual satisfaction between couples whose spouses were diagn osed with AD, but it was not possible to investigate if all forms of intimacy were considered as a sexual activity and the impact on marital relationship. Many studies affirm that, in dementia, different types of intimacy, like physical contact, kissing an d hugging might be considered as sexual activity (Davies et al., 2010; Davies, Sridhar, Newkirk, Beaudreau & O’Hara, 2012; Nogueira et al., 2016 ).", "In that way, we decided to better understand how the marital relationship is influenced by the progression o f AD according to the spouse -carers’. In addition, we investigated what is considered as a sexual activity for spouse - carers, and their sexual satisfaction with the progression of the illness. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the impact of the onset of AD in spouse -carers’ life and how the progression of AD affects the marital relationship.", "Methods Design We used a qualitative design in order to understand the changes that occur in the marital relationship between couples after the diagnosis, based on analysis of spouses -carers’ reports. We conducted face -to-face semi -structured interviews about changes in the marital relationship, sexual activity and sexual satisfaction.", "All interviews were recorded, transcribed and subjected to int erpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA) to identify the key elements in the participants’ experiences and perceptions. We applied IPA because it explores in detail the participant’s view of the topic under investigation, exploring how the individual reports his/her condition and the subjective perceptual process trying to make sense of his/her condition (Smith, Jarman & Osborn, 1999). In addition, an interpretative method, allows to, in an interactive context, extracted participants’ perception and rese archers’ beliefs and perceptions. So, the researcher is involved in interpretative activity, attempting to give meaning to the spouse - carers’ subjectivity.", "Participants We recruited a convenience sample of spouse -carers (N=11; 9 women) whose spouses were diagnosed with Alzheimer’s Disease (AD), according to the criteria set out in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition, text revision (DSM -IV-TR) (APA, 2000). Other sociodemographic characteristics of PLWAD and their spouse -carers are shown in table 1. The clinical diagnosis of AD was based on a clinical interview with the P LWAD and spouse -carers, cognitive screening tests, laboratory tests, and imaging studies. The P LWAD attended the outpatient clinic at the Center for Alzhei mer’s Disease run by the Institute of Psychiatry at the Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro (CDA/IPUB/UFRJ) in the city of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, for routine follow -up appoint ments, and their spouse -carers were consecutively selected to participate in the study. The interviews were conducted between January 2018 and December 2018. All the spouse -carers were able to offer detailed information about the PLWAD life history, cognitive functioning and capacity to perform activities of daily living. All famil y carers were previously informed about the diagnosis by the responsible psychiatrist. We excluded care rs with a reported history of psychiatric or cognitive disorders .", "(table1) Data analysis A qualitative analysis was conducted to achieve a rigorous, comprehensive description of topics. Interviews were tape -recorded and transcribed. The first stage of the analysis was read and revised the transcript closely in order to become as intimate as po ssible with the account, making preliminar associations, connections, interpretations and insights. Then, emerging theme titles were noted using key words that capture the essential quality of finding, and grouped together. The process was cyclical: If a n ew theme emerged, all transcripts should be tested again (Smith, Jarman & Osborn, 1999). Some quotations were highlighted to illustrate the topics and, when possible, spouse -carers’ own words were used to label them. The key points were grouped independent ly and then compared the resulting data. All researchers debated the analytic ideas, and differences and similarities were discussed until a consensus. The related topics were hierarchically organized and a list of topics was summarized. All transcripts we re analyzed according to consensus topics, and a full list of extracts related to each topic was compiled. Finally, we engaged in an interpretative process to understand how these extracts integrate with or challenge current theory. These interpretations w ere grouped if there appeared to be a connection between them, forming subthemes. The subthemes were grouped and originated three themes.", "Ethical Issues This study was approved by the Ethics Committee at the Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ) In stitute of Psychiatry. All spouse -carers signed an informed consent form before they were interviewed. Results Three themes emerged from the analysis of spouse -carers’ narratives: 1) Psychological and emotional impact; 2) Social impact; 3) Sexual impact. 1) Psychological and emotional impact The onset of AD and its progression may affect the whole marital relationship. We found nine subthemes of the main theme about the psychological and emotional impact expressed by spouse -carers. 1.1) A mother and a son relation ship The marital relationship commonly changes to a parent -child relationship with the provided care routine and worries about PLWAD. So, some spouse expressed the feeling of losing their couple hood to assume a parent role. “It is like a mother and a son relationship. There is no a marriage anymore, do you understand? Because now I’m his mother. It’s everything on me” (Spouse 1, 69 years, female).", "“Oh, today I am a wife, mother, carer, friend, counselor ... I mean, I don’t even know if I am a counselor bec ause a counselor gives an advice, come in here, come out here, right? Then he’s doing it very soon, but I ... the wife herself, she already has several functions, right? And the carer and mother was added to me.” (Spouse 11,72 years, female)", "Not only spouse -carers perceive these changes, also the PLWAD may perceive the marital relationship changing to a parent relationship.", "“He said something very interesting to me (…) Well, he said to me: \"Today ... the person I loved the most in this life, other than you, was my mother. And as a child, I was very worried about my mother, \"he said. (…) So he said that what he felt for his mother when he was a boy, he feels for me today” (Spouse 11, 72 years, female)", "1.2) A dependent relationship Some carers feel the marital relationship as a dependent relationship. They describe situations that PLWAD ask for attention and the spouse -carers feel stuck.", "“Because he cares about me, he ... actually, it’s an obsession. I have to be near him, he has to be close to me. I f I go out ... when I come to get his medicine, he stays with my sister. He gets desperate. \"What time does she arrive?\", \"Is she coming?\", he’s very worried.” (Spouse 6, 64 years, female) “The change that happened was that I got stuck. Because, like I alr eady told you, I would leave him and I could go downtown to do some shopping. I could come out like that, because I have never been out alone. I always just go out with him for parties, these things. So, now it’s like this ... how can I say? I got stuck, b ecause I can’t go out and leave him.” (Spouse 7,77 years, female).", "The dependent relationship includes spouse -carers assuming more responsibility in daily decisions after the onset of dementia.", "“No. Just like that, I need to pay more attention to him for his illness. He forgets everything. As I already told you, it was him that paid the bills, it was him that went out. Now it’s all my responsibility. So, what happened? Did it influence? It influe nced because I was more responsible for accounts, for payment. I have to remember everything, for doctor. How old are you? He cannot tell you. He says, \"ask her\". So, he’s always say to ask me. So, has it changed? Changed because I got more responsible, ri ght? It is not like a person, two old persons, but all two good. So, changed those things.” (Spouse 7, 77 years, female)", "1.3) Marital relationship changed to a friendship Spouse -carers feel that the marital relationship also may change to a friendship. Some s pouse -carers understand that as a natural change that occurs after a long relationship. Furthermore, the additional support that spouse -carers provide may be perceived as a return of all support they received previously, and this may result in a closest re lationship and a partner valuation. “Oh, I don’t know, for me it is not even a marriage anymore, it’s like a friendship, right? It ’s not…” (Spouse 6, 64 years, female) “I evaluate that it’s following the normal course, which is a partnership that was made 35 years ago by two friends. It was very good for these friends and now, whatever is bad for one or the other, there is this friendship of service”.(Spouse 8, 62 years, female)", "1.4) Still a good relationship The change that occur with the progression of demen tia may not change the feeling between couples. Commonly, spouse -carers perceive the modification in the relationship, but affirm that it does not change the affection between them. Moreover, a satisfied premorbid marital relationship is associated with a more positive perception of changes that occur with the illness. Although spouse -carers affirm that the relationship had changed, they still perceive it as a good relationship.", "“When the Alzheimer’s began, he was 80 years old, and things changed totally, right? We didn’t have relationships anymore, we didn’t have that husband and wife relationship anymore , but we always had a good relationship, do you understand?” (Spouse 1, 69 years, female) \"It’s good because he’s a good person. He isn’t a bad person. He was always very nice, you know? I’m sitting like that, he kisses. He’s a good person, you know? He’s not aggressive, never was. He’s peaceful. He’s kind.\" (Spouse 2, 61 years, female)", "1.5) Affection but not sexual Some spouse -carers affirm that the routine an d affection are the same, and the only change in the marital relationship that occurs was in the sexual activity.", "“Look, the routine itself has not changed. We’re just ... what do you say ... people say ... \"Oh, 28 years ... now they’re brother and sister,\" you understand? But we have a lot of love, a lot of love to each other. That has not changed, we are just more like this", "... quiet.” (Spouse 4, 59 years, male)", "“I think it’s just that, about sexual intercourse. The rest remains the same. Every now and then, he stays ... he says some things that are not very nice. But that way, I know it’s from the illness and I don’t care” (Spouse 6, 64 years, female)", "1.6) Maybe for better Although all changes and difficulties related to the progression of AD, spouse -carers can perceive the improvement of the relationship and feel the partner closer. Therefore, the quality of marital relationship before the illness will affect the spouse -carers’ experiences and how they deal with the PLWAD . \"Look, nothing has changed. Friendship is the same, love is the same, especially on the part from him. There is time that he recognizes a lot. He says, \"This is my guardian angel.\" It didn’t change that wa y ... and if it changed it, changed for better (…) but I think it has improved, despite the sadness of seeing a perfect person, yet young, because he is young (…)” (Spouse 3, 77 years, female) “Maybe for better. It is not that it has improved, it’s ... it’s like recognition, right? From him, right? He recognizes things like this: \"Thank you for being here with me. You have a lot patience with me. You’re a good partner. You treat me tenderly and take care of my things.\" So I think it’s better in that way. ” (Spouse 8, 62 years, female)", "1.7) No changes Even though the routine suffers many changes, spouse -carers may evaluate their own relationship in the same way it was before the diagnosis. In our sample, only one male spouse -carer verbalized this point. “We are okay, like... because I was very upset about my son's death, too. I’m doing treatment with a psychologist ... and we’re well, always together (…) The marital relationship had no change, at least I think.” (Spouse 5, 65 years, male)", "1.8) Time of marriage The period of marriage is seen as responsible for changes between couples. In our sample, just one male spouse -carer reported the changes in his marital relationship to how long they were married, and excluded all possibilities to relate the modification t o PLWAD condition.", "“The time of marriage. The illness doesn’ t influence. We are very kind to each other, understand? It has always been like that. I didn’ t go anywhere without her, and she without me, got it? ” (Spouse 4, 59 years, male)", "1.9) Not even married If the relationship had interpersonal problems before the onset of dementia, commonly continues to be a conflicting relationship after the diagnosis. Frequently, spouse -carers whom notice their relationship negatively, might perceive more impact of caring for a PWLAD.", "“I define my marriage today ... I don’t even define myself as married. I think my marriage had failed a long time ago, understand? When he became ill, I was already separated from him. I have been separated from him for 16 years (...) And now I don’t have anything else to do. Now I must hold until the end, right? (…) For him the marriage never ended, understand? For him ... he’s in love with me, he thinks I am married to him. But I’m not married to him, understand (…) For him, on his head, he was never separated. He never stopped investing. And lately I see that he’s very lonely. So, he stays up the whole time, while I am asleep, he keeps petting me. I tell him not to do, to stop, or I will go to sleep in separate bed, I will go to sleep in the living room ... Then, he stops. He says: \"But I don’t understand why you don’t like affection.\" Then, I say: \"Because I don’t like it. I’m not your wife anymore. I don’t like you anymore. I will take care of you, but we’re not hus band and wife, understand? I make that very clear to him. He understands, but he doesn’t accept it, right?” (Spouse 9, 51 years, female) 2) Social impact The progression of AD may have a social impact, and spouse -carers describe the impact on their social lif e. We found two subthemes about the social impact caused by the progression of AD.", "2.1) My partner is alive and I miss him/her The quality of the relationship may decline with decreased pleasure in the company of each other. Some spouse -carers use their relationship before the onset of dementia to compare how the relationship changed. They express their sadness and their sense of losing connection with PLWAD, and complain about the changes that occur in their social life.", "“The other day, I was thinking: Oh, he’s alive and I miss my husband alive. Oh, I said, but he’s alive. Suddenly, I began to miss him. Oh, I said to myself: It i s true, he’s alive and I miss him, because he changed ... he really changed. We used to talk a lot, also traveling. He wasn’t to plan trips, but I used to plan a trip and he accepted it. It’s not ... but he liked it. ” (Spouse 11, 72 years, female) “It used to be like that, for example: he doesn’t drink beer, but if I said \"let's have a beer?\" He would sit in the bar and make a point of paying me to drink and sit. These things have just changed” (Spouse 2, 61 years, female) “Only we don’t go to a movie theat er, we don’t go ... we only go in family stuff, because ... he didn’t like it, right? He didn’t like to go out when we were married ... when he was normal. And now then, after illness, he doesn’t even remember that there are such things .” (Spouse 6, 64 yea rs, female)", "2.2) Friends do not remember inviting us It is not only because the PLWAD do not want to have an active social life or it loose priority to them, but friends and family avoid inviting the couple to have fun while the illness progress.", "“It’s to don’t go out . Don’t going to the parties of friends that we used to go. While we lived ... we went to his brothers' house and everything. We were always invited. Not now. We live far away and he’s sick too ... people don’t remember inviting us, eh? (Spo use 6, 64 years, female) \"Now, this is for now. We used to go out a lot. There was a cousin who was coming out a lot. We were going to dance, had a dinner on Fridays. Now she also moved (...) Far away. She was living in ‘Leblon’ (neighborhood). Her husband also has his problems. I mean, life is changing, right? \"(Spouse 10, 78 years, female)", "3) Sexual impact We found eight subthemes of the main theme about the sexual impact that occur with the progression of AD. Moreover, for further understanding, we asked spouse -carers if non -intercourse intimacy, as kissing, hugging, and affection is considered as a sexual activity to them. 3.1) Changes before the onset of dementia Independently of how the relationship was before the progression of AD, some spouse -carers a ffirmed that the sexual activity changed or stopped before the onset of the dementia and the illness is not responsible for the change in sexual activity.", "“Normal. I mean, a little bit earlier, right? Because when he started to forget, he already started i n that process. When the diagnosis came we were already ...” (Spouse 1, 69 years, female) “Oh, we were very explosive, but for some years, from 10 years now, it was not that often, did you understand? But there was always ... there was sex.” (Spouse 6, 64 years, female)", "“No, I cannot be very affectionate with him, understand? I have a ... I don’t know, it's a ... It seems like there's something that blocks me (…) Sometimes he hugs me, kisses me and it bothers me. I don’t have this affection for him. Already before the diagnosis, it had already been a long time. Since the day I didn’t want to be with him anymore, I never cared again, hugged and kissed, understood? And sometimes he comes to hug me and kiss me, and it bothers me” (Spouse 9, 51 years, fem ale)", "3.2) PLWAD forgot conflicts before AD One spouse -carer expressed stress about her marital relationship and how her husband forgets about conflicts that occur before the illness. “No, before the illness he didn’t tried because he knew that I didn’t want to, understand? But now, since he doesn’t understand that much, oh, sometimes he comes to hug me, to kiss me ... to thank me. That bothers me, you know? I don’t like it.” (Spouse 9, 51 years, female)", "3.3) Because of aging For many spouse -carers, aging, instead of PLWAD condition, is perceived as a responsible for changes in the sexual activity. “Also because of his age, right? He’s very old. He was almost eighty years old, do you understand? It was obvious that it would be much slower ... much less activity, right? And then, it gradually slowed down. As it were from aging. It was not because of the illness it was ... did you und erstand?” (Spouse 1, 69 years, female)", "“Nothing has changed. Still the same thing. The caresses, hugs and kisses continue, only the sex that does not. Because have sex with 82 -year-old is not possible.” (Spouse 7, 77 years, female)", "“We have, we have. No , it hasn’t changed. Sexual activity hasn’t changed. It has changed in this way, because he turned 80 years old this year. So, there is no more like this ... vigor. No longer is that same force, but he has that ... let's say like this ... it's ... the free word, right? The horny. He has. For me, he always had and continues to have. He said \"I don’t know what that is. I have never been as horny for a woman as I have for you.” (Spouse 11, 72 years, female)", "“It hasn’t changed by the symptoms. Changed by the s tages that we spend in life, by the age of us. He's going to be 60, I'm going to be 63. And it’s natural that it changes. I don’t believe in these stories of having sex until the age of 100 or with the same excitement. For me, this is a story to sell medic ations, but I don’t believe it. I believe it’s an understanding of the two so that it’s a pleasant thing for one and the other, but within that system you are living.” (Spouse 8, 62 years, female)", "3.4) Medication", "Medical condition may be one important reason for PLWAD less interest in sexual activity. In that way, two spouse -carers expressed their beliefs that a side effect of the medication influenced the change in sexual activity. “I think that was the medication. After he started taking lots of pills ... I guess that was why. Because at the beginning we still did it, but then ... I didn’t insist either, because it's annoying, right? (…) Ah, that was bad, because ... but for me I also set it aside. The medication was that killed him like this, you know ? He's not that old. He's still a good age, 72, right?” (Spouse 2, 61 years, female) “I'm thinking it's the medication. I look at her the same way I looked when she was 18 years.... when I met her ... it’s the same way, the same affection. With desire, with everything, understand? But we were quiet in the corner ... she also looks at me in a sexual way ... There is desire...” (Spouse 4, 59 years, male)", "3.5) About the affection Although the changes in sexual activity, some spouses affirmed that the feeling of affection did not change or even got better.", "“Just the sexual part. The affectionate part, of cares, always has. I hug her, grab her, give her a kiss. This doesn’t have any problem.” (Spouse 4, 59 years, male)", "“We sleep in the same bed, just have no sexual relationship because I don’t want it and even her (…) Yeah. I'm more kind with her. She's colder, so ... she always was. When we dated and I picked and kissed her on the street, she got angry. She didn’t like it.” (Spouse 5, 65 years, male) “Well, we kiss, hug, these things ... but sex... because it's no matter if you insist ... to be honest I don’t even insist because he gets nervous. But I have not… And so, at first, he was still in the one of wanting to take ‘blue pill' and those things, but not now. Even forgot, neither speak, nor touches (…) but about the affection, I think ... it's just that we're together, that he gives me attention and these things, and I also give him a lot of attention ... sex goes unno ticed.” (Spouse 7, 77 years, female)", "“I hug him. I hug. I don’t want any more of ... how do you say it? Sleeping with him. I don’t have. It´s over. I'm 78 years old, was a lot. It’s enough” (Spouse 10, 78 years, female)", "“Oh, it exists. He hugs me, he tri es to protect me, poor him. That’s me who takes care of him, I protect him, but he thinks he’s the man, that he’s the male and that I’m the female. So, he, as a male, has to protect me” (Spouse 11, 72 years, female)", "3.6) The importance of sexual activity When asked about the sexual activity and its importance in the marital relationship, there was not a consensus and spouse -carers expressed different ways to interpret.", "“Good, it's not because I ... in marriage, that's the main thing and we don’t do it. So , in that sense, it's not good.” (Spouse 2, 61 years, female) “Maybe I don’t miss sex, because I think sex is a complement. It's my opinion. As I didn’t have this care, this affection, this attention ... love ... could have even love, because I was a slave ... I don’t miss the sex. Of course, I feel ... sometimes ... so, well, a person treats you well, like my granddaughter with her husband. I don’t think about sex. I think is pretty. And he was a man who never walked holding hands with me.” (Spouse 3, 77 y ears, female) “Very weak. I try to contain myself, but I'm not comfortable. I'm going, from now on, if it's something that affects something, I'll try to get closer to see if we…” (Spouse 4, 59 years, male) “For me, I don’t know. Actually, I don’t miss it. ” (Spouse 6, 64, years, female)", "3.7) Difference in sexual activity caused by AD The progression of AD may be followed by decrease in sexual activity, and some spouses perceive the illness as a cause for the interruption of sexual activity.", "“The only chan ge that had, that I was really worried about, was this thing of sexual intercourse. This really I ... we were more active, but it wasn’t from the illness. It was ... two ... more or less this ... from the illness we started to be like this” (Spouse 4, 59 years, male) “I think it was normal. We had a sexual activity once a week, more or less. After the diagnosis he had no more. It still had some sexual activity, but then no ... ah, I don’t know, it wasn’t anymore ... no more erection, I don’t know ...” (Spouse 6, 64 years, female) “Look, after (the diagnosis) still had a few times, but then stopped. We didn’t have any more. He didn’t even look for more, neither ... nor ... insisting on kissing, hugging and he had no reaction at all. He stopped having an interest and I went along, because doesn't matter to hugging, kissing, nothing, nothing happens.” (Spouse 7, 77 years, female) “No, she doesn’t look for it. In the old days she used to try, she was making jokes and things ... but nowadays, she doesn’t look for me. She stays in her corner, and I don’t know if that's what made me look like this ... and I don’t ... don’t collide with her.” (Spouse 4, 59 years, male)", "3.8) Cares replace sexual activity?", "For some spouse -carers kissing, hugs and affection may sub stitute the sexual activity .", "“I think so. I think it's equivalent. It’s not a thing ... from time to time, I noticed a difference in her too. She laughs a lot. She expresses more joy.” (Spouse 5, 65 years, male) “I think so, yeah, it's a sign that you still have love for each other. Not even sex isn’t everything in life. It's like money. It's not everything in life. I think what it’s in life yet, is you have a feeling for the other person, don’t you? This is my case. I like him, he was my first boyfrien d. I don’t intend in my life to ever put him in a place for someone to care” (Spouse 7, 77 years, female) “It's ... it's ... but we have sexual activity. But it’s ... the day that you no longer have sexual activity, no problem. This care, his attention is very cool. The day that I don’t have this affection, that attention, that's what I'm going to miss.” (Spouse 10, 78 years, female) “No, but if it’s to understand then we have (…) Very, absolutely. If we can say that this is a sexual practice, we have a lot . Daily.” (Spouse 8, 62 years, female)", "For others, although perceive the care as an important part in the marital relationship, they do not understand as a replacement of sexual activity. “Oh, I don’t think so. I don’t. I think, in my opinion, I think. But, what? The illness came, I have to accept, right? I wish he was healthy, relaxed.” (Spouse 2, 61 years, female) “No, they don’t replace (sexual activity). I think not.” (Spouse 4, 59 years, male) “It doesn’t replace no, but it's good for him, right?” ( Spouse 10, 78 years, female) “No. It has nothing to see one thing with the other (…) No, for me it's a love that we always had to each other. Sexual practice for me ... I'm an old lady ... it's something else. This is affection for me. For me, that's sweetheart. It has nothing to do. It remains as it always was: sex on one side and this is affection, our love for each other ” (Spouse 8, 62 years, female)", "Discussion The progression of dementia may individually impact on each member of the couple, influencing the sense of couplehood (Waham et al., 2015). In that way, we qualitatively investigated the changes in the marital relationship that occur after de onset of AD.", "The topics that emerged from spouse -carers’ reports reflect the changes and difficulties that couples face in AD. Compared to other degrees of kinship, spouse -carers tend to be closer to PLWAD (Nogueira et al., 2016 ) and to be more influenced by the progr ession of the illness. In our sample, spouse -carers related feelings inherent to the provided care, including feelings of stress, poor emotional wellbeing, frustration, doubts about how to deal with the situation, sadness, loneliness, decrease in sexual ac tivity, as well as the perception of a closer relationship and a higher affection to PLWAD. It is important to notice that the quality of couples’ relationship is a valued predictor of how spouse -carers’ are dealing with the role of provide care.", "Therefor e, when spouse -carers perceive their marital relationship in a positive way, they provide care with higher quality and less impact of caring. In contrast, a problematic premorbid relationship influences negatively in the way spouse -carers deal with PLWAD a nd the role of provide care (Davies et al., 2010; Dourado et al., 2010). As an example, the sub -theme “Not even married”, a spouse -carer expressed the distress of not feeling married, but still felt the obligation of helping her husband with his condition, and she expressed how this situation is difficult to her.", "Moreover, spouse -carers may feel more responsible of provided care when compared to other degrees of kindship and it may result in a modification of relationship into a parent -child relation ( Pinquart, & Sörensen, 2011 ; Nogueira et al., 2014 ). Also, there are gender -related differences in providing care. Commonly, female spouse -carers assume many tasks such as being wife, lover and mother. On the other hand, male spouse -carers may receive help from other family members and usually maintains the role as a husband longer (Dourado et al., 2010, Davies et al., 2012 ). In our findings, only female spouse - carers affirmed that the marital relationship changed to a parent -child relationship or was adjust ed to a committed dependent relationship. Further, only male spouse -carers expressed that did not perceive any change in the marital relationship after the onset of AD, and if any change was noticed, they related it to another reason instead of the illness .", "According to Nogueira et al. ( 2016 ), the sexual activity has low priority for the healthy spouse, especially if he/she receives no help from others and there is conflict between the roles they assume. Although the literature affirms that male spouse -carers are commonly engaged in sexual activity longer than female spouse -carers (Dourado et al., 2010, Davies et al., 2012 ), our data did not show that. The probable reason is that the understanding of sexual satisfaction and sexual activity may be re -signifi ed by each spouse -carer and how he or she perceives his or her relationship, independently of the gender. For some spouse -carers the non -intercourse intimacy might be considered as a sexual activity in AD. For others, this kind of intimacy, as kissing, hug ging and other forms of physical contact are very important into the marital relationship, but it may not be considered as sexual activity.", "Some limitations of our study should be acknowledged. First, we had a small sample of spouse -carers with majority of women. Further studies should control the gender of spouse -carer, because the involvement in provide care is different according gender (Nogueira et al., 2014 ). Second, we only interviewed spouse -carers to express the changes in the marital relationship. Including PLWAD would be valued because listening to them would emphasize their value as a person.", "The findings illustrate that spouse -carers present an oscillating process of adaptation to the situation and experiencing feelings of loss. In our sample, gender influenced the perception of change in marital relationship, but not with changes in sexual activity. The illness is perceived differently by each partner, and each spouse -carer may experience different extents of decline in the relationship ( Nogueir a et al., 2014 ). Moreover, our results would be helpful for development of psychoeducational interventions designed for spouse -carers and their partners diagnosed with AD, in order to provide better information about specificities of the couples’ relations hip, and methods for coping with the condition.", "References", "American Psychiatric Association.

Entretanto, não foi encontrada nenhuma diferença significativa entre a QdV de casais e a QdV de não casais. É interessante notar que, apesar de não haver diferença significativa entre as díades, os fatores que influenciam a avaliação da QdV são diferentes para cônjuges -cuidadores e seus parceiros com DA (casais) e cuidadores não -cônjuges e seus parceiros com DA (não-casais) . Percebemos que cuidadores não -cônjuges apresentaram uma melhor QdV, quando comparados aos cônjuges -cuidadores . Contudo, essa diferença não foi significativa. Quando a QdV foi comparada por seus domínios, os dois grupos apresentaram domínios diferentes como sendo impor tantes para a avaliação da QdV. Cuidadores não -cônjuges avaliaram melhor os domínios de amigos e saúde física. Tal fato pode ser explicado pois os cuidadores não -cônjuges, normalmente recebem ajuda de outros familiares, e por isso, exercem menos tempo de cuidado ao portador de DA quando com parados aos cônjuges - cuidadores, o que permite uma menor influência em sua própria saúde física. Os cônjuges -cuidadores, por normalmente assumirem os cuidados sozinhos, dedicam mais horas de cuidados (FITZPATRICK et al., 2010, NOGUEIRA et al., 2014). Assim, possuem menos tempo livre para relacionamentos sociais , o que pode ocasionar um afastamento de amigos. Vale ressaltar que o gênero pode influenciar ainda mais na percepção do afastamento social. As cônjuges - cuidadoras, usualmente, assumem os cuidados sozinhas por acreditarem que o papel de cuidadora é uma extensão de seu papel como esposa (FITZPATRICK et al., 2010) . Dessa forma, é possível notar que , em seus relatos, elas afirmam que percebem o afastamento de amigos e f amiliares com a progressão da DA.", "Ao avaliarmos a QdV entre diferentes tipos de portadores de DA, não percebemos diferença significativa no escore total da QdV. Entretanto, os fatores que influenciam na avaliação da QdV são distintos entre os dois tipos de pacientes. Os pacientes que possuem como seus cuidadores seus cônjuges, avaliam que a consciência da doença seja um fator importante na avaliação de sua QdV. Os pacientes que possuem com o cuidadores algum familiar, que não seja o seu cônjuge, avalia m que os seus próprios sintomas depressivos estão relacionados à sua QdV. Estudos anteriores afirmam que a consciência da doença e seus déficits podem possuir impacto na percepção da QdV do paciente com DA (LOGSDON et al. , 2002 ), assim como os sintomas depressi vos podem influenciar na auto avaliação da QdV de portadores de DA (HURT et al., 2009, VOGEL et al., 2012 ). Dessa forma, ambos achados estão em acordo com a literatura, mas vale destacar que pacientes casados e não casados avaliam que fatores distintos in fluenciam na avaliação de sua própria É importante ressaltar também que a satisfação sexual entre casais pode influenciar na percepção de QdV, uma vez que a intimidade desempenha um papel fundamental na determinação da felicidade da relação conjugal (GALLAGHER -THOMPSON, 2001). Com a progressão da doença, a relação do casal pode ser afetada em todas as dimensões (LITZ; ZEISS; DAVIES,1990, WRIGHT, 1991, ELONIEMI -SULKAVA et al., 2002, VUGT, 2003, SIMONELLI et al., 2008, HAYES et al., 2009, DAVIES et al., 2010, DOURADO et al., 2010) , pois os cuidados diários podem gerar um afastamento da intimidade do casal. Abdo (2013) descreve a intimidade do casal como um nível de compromisso e sentimentos positivos, funcionamento cognitivo e proximidade física com um parceiro em uma relação recíp roca. Assim, as mudanças que ocorrem decorrentes dos cuidados prestados pelo cuidador podem transformar a relação conjugal em uma relação parental, ou seja, a intimidade conjugal é afetada podendo gerar desgaste para a díade e influenciar na qualidade do relacionamento e consequentemente na QdV de pacientes com DA e seus cônjuges -cuidadores (WRIGHT,1991, SZWABO,200 3, DAVIES et al., 2010, NOGUEIRA et al., 2016) .", "Apesar de estudos afirmarem que a demonstração de carinho como abraços, toques e beijos pode ser considerada como atividade sexual na demência (LITZ; ZEISS; DAVIES, 1990, DAVIES et al., 2010, DAVIES et al., 2012), não houve consenso entre os cônjuges -cuidadores avaliados por esse estudo. Os cônjuges -cuidadores apresentaram menores níveis de satisfação sexual quando comparados aos seus parceiros com DA, contudo, independentemente do gênero, os cônjuges -cuidadores relataram diferentes percepções sobre o que eles consideram como atividade sexual . É importante notar que diferentes indiv íduos podem possuir diferentes percepções e significados para a mesma situação. Ainda, o tipo de relação entre a díade pode influenciar de forma distinta o cônjuge -cuidador e seu parceiro com DA, assim como, problemas prévios no relacionamento podem influenciar de maneira negativa a maneira que o cônjuge -cuidador enxerga o seu parceiro e a relação conjugal (DAVIES et al., 2010; DOURADO et al., 2010 ).", "Conclusão Sendo assim, p odemos concluir que a QdV dos casais pode ser influenciada por diversos fatores e, apesar de a QdV de casais não apresentar diferença significativa no escore total quando comparada a QdV de díades não casais, as díades apresentam fatores diferentes como importantes para a avaliação. Assim, o estudo da QdV entre casais nos quais um de seus cônjuges seja por tador de DA é particularmente relevante, pois demonstra que sua QdV possui demandas específicas, e a qualidade do relacionamento conjugal, assim como a sexualidade podem ser afetadas pela progressão da DA. Dessa forma, o estudo desse gr upo específico most ra a necessidade de profissionais de saúde de atentar para as especificidades dos diferentes grupos de cuidadores de forma a desenvolver intervenções psicossociais e não farmacológicas voltadas para as características específicas de cada grupo , visando uma melhor QdV para os membros das díades .", "Referências Bibliográficas ABDO , C.H.N; OLIVEIRA , W.

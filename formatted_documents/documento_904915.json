The first essay brings evidence that CEO turnover in state-owned enterprises (SOEs) is greater than in private companies due to political and electoral processes, making its succession and governance processes unique. A longitudinal study of impacts of election outcomes and CEO successions on market prices of the three largest SOEs in Brazil over 24 years is presented. Elections and CEO successions can generate abnormal returns on SOEs stocks. As CEO successions happen more often in SOEs, investors must monitor political events and deal with specific governance risks to invest in SOEs. The second essay analyzes the relation between CEO turnover, corporate governance, and ownership structure. While CEO turnover is usually associated with negative firm performance, it can also be affected by corporate governance quality and ownership characteristics. Analyzing a unique dataset of CEO turnover including Brazilian firms that voluntarily adopt good governance practices through listing on “Novo Mercado”, we find a negative relation between CEO turnover and firm performance, which indicates that low performance increases the likelihood of CEO turnover. We also document that firms with good corporate governance practices tend to change CEOs more frequently than traditional firms, due to increased monitoring of their executives. The third essay extends the analysis of the previous one by looking also at executive turnover and industry aspects, with special focus on family-controlled companies, the most relevant group in our sample. Industry aspects help shape the governance of companies and other relevant corporate governance aspects to be considered when analyzing the CEO and executive turnover relation to firm performance are top management team and board size and board composition.", "Keywords: Corporate governance, CEO turnover, executive turnover, firm performance, ownership", "RESUMO", "GUIMARAES, Sergio Foldes .

By looking at distinct performance metrics, we try to understand what matters to the top management team, to board members and ultimately to shareholders.", "Performance and governance are important topics to every company and every investor should pay attention to them. But not all companies are alike, and the wonder of how different organizations deal with these themes is one of the reasons of this investigation.", "There is important research related to CEO and executive turnover in labor economics, human resources, leadership, strategy, finance, corporate governance, and other fields, but few dedicated studies to emerging markets in general. In Brazil, succession planning in privately held family companies is a theme more studied than CEO turnover in listed companies.", "CEOs and top management actions are naturally linked to firm performance and are evaluated in the short and in the long run. Important theories in management study the role of top management in generating firm performance, from romance of leadership theory (Meind, Ehrlich, & Dukerich, 1985) to upper echelons theory (Hambrick & Mason, 1984) with the controversy of the real role of management resulting in estimations of the “CEO effect” (Hambrick & Quigley, 2013). CEO and executive turnover are complex processes that companies must face. Succession and contingent plans for replacing executives are important concerns of any organization, but the ability to do so when needed and provide an effective response will vary from company to company. The acclaimed and awarded “Succession” television show portraits how a family deals with an aging entrepreneur to handle the disputes on who will manage the family businesses in the future,", "dealing with shareholders and competitors, something that is not unlikely even in markets such as the US market, where dispersed ownership is more common.

Rowe et al. (2005) analyze results from the hockey teams over 60 years and find important evidence that the leader can have a major influence in performance.", "Recently, Bennedsen, Pérez-González & Wolfenzon (2020) have shown that even temporary CEO health licenses affect performance. The hype about the exact contribution of leaders to performance and how they should be compensated is still an unsolved puzzle that is heavily debated.", "CEO and executive turnover are relevant turning points where antecedents and consequences of changes in management can be studied.

Bras. Gest. Neg. São Paulo v.22, Special Issue. 2020 p. 462-481, in a special issue dedicated to Corporate Governance. It is named \"Elections and CEO successions in Brazilian state-owned companies\", which explores the uniqueness of CEO successions in the most important Brazilian SOEs, affected by political events. CEO successions in these SOEs are more frequent than in private peers over the last 20 years and the impacts for investors are presented through event studies. It is important to discuss governance of SOEs in the context of recent political and institutional crisis, with corruption scandals affecting SOEs and several important private companies and reaching important politicians in Brazil, in a process that culminated in a presidential impeachment in 2016, with a slow recovery afterwards, that still has consequences for the economy.", "By making clear that SOEs have a different corporate governance due to its controlling shareholder, being subject to political events determining changes in the TMT, differently than private peers, the essay highlights the role and the risks that investors face in SOEs.", "The differences of how SOE are managed will also appear in different analysis in the second and third essays, which address listed companies in general in Brazil and where governance aspects are linked to top management turnover events and to performance, providing estimates of the CEO performance sensitiveness according to its governance. To pursue these essays, we built a unique database with CEO and executive turnovers through access information filed by companies in CVM systems via GetDFPData library by Perlin, Kirch & Vancin (2019) in R. Statistical analysis was also made in R studio programming environment. The emergence of the “Novo Mercado” (NM) segment in Brazil is a landmark of the recognition of the importance that corporate governance practices have for investors. The NM segment has been important to mitigate risks and concerns of expropriation, translating in higher valuations and better access to capital. Companies listing on NM segment are committed to better practices in corporate governance and information disclosure, to granting minority shareholders more rights than required by law and keeping minimum share liquidity requirements. NM listing is a key variable to differentiate companies in the second and third essays.", "A version of the second essay has been submitted for publication on a top international journal and is named “Do performance, ownership, and governance influence CEO turnover? Evidence from Brazil”. It addresses the importance of the NM segment for enhancing the effectiveness for investors of the monitoring role of executives, making CEO evaluation more linked to performance in companies with different kinds of controlling shareholders. It shows that firm performance and corporate governance matter to CEO turnover, especially in family-controlled companies.", "The third essay, named “Governance, performance, and industry influence on CEO and Top Management turnover in Brazil ”, looks beyond CEO turnover, performance, and corporate governance aspects by incorporating analysis of executive turnover in general and industry dimensions, besides other governance variables related to board size and composition, with a special interest in family- controlled companies, the most important group in our sample. Those dimensions help to explain the role of performance and how much it matters in CEO and executive turnover in Brazil, for different types of companies. It documents the growing trend in executive turnover in general, confirming the importance of corporate governance to greater CEO and executive turnover sensitivity.

In the past two decades, discussions about governance and strategic importance of these companies have been on the headlines, swinging between privatization wishes and defendants of greater role of SOEs in the economy. Concerns about governance in SOEs has been a theme for political discussions and debate in the Brazilian society, as they have been often involved in corruption scandals and faced management and governance problems caused by political interference.", "Recent changes in law try to minimize these problems but real impacts are yet to be seen. However, its first tests may provide evidence that political interference has not finished. A recent case of CEO (Chief Executive Officer) succession in the most important Brazilian SOE (Petrobras) shows that political interference can still impact markets and be a determinant of executive turnover in SOEs.", "CEO succession has been a key theme for researchers but not on SOEs, despite their presence being relevant in several economies. We posit that successions in SOEs are linked to political and electoral processes, with executive turnover in SOEs being greater than in private companies, making succession and governance processes in SOEs unique.", "In general, there is a downward trend for CEO tenure that Charan (2005) calls the CEO crisis, more dramatic in companies without successors ready to take the helm. Shorter CEO tenure provokes corporate instability and market uncertainty which may harm company´s image and affect all stakeholders. It is in this context that succession matters more than ever.", "A recent survey1 by the World Economic Forum mentions lack of leadership as a global trend, as 86% of the respondents think there is a leadership crisis. Brazil has one of the smallest confidence indexes on leadership.", "In democracies, politicians must face elections every few years and in companies, CEOs must be confirmed by shareholders and boards and are threatened by the possibility of being ousted. In fact, besides the election or general assembly period, there is always the chance of a non-expected turnover.", "1 World Economic Forum (2015) - http://reports.weforum.org/outlook-global-agenda-2015/top-10- trends-of-2015/3-lack-of-leadership", "CEOs of listed SOEs are often seen as executives and politicians, as they are appointed by governments and are subject to double pressure, by government and market participants.", "The political praxis in Brazil, now unveiled by “Operation Car Wash”, has been to let different political parties forming a coalition appoint names to top positions in Brazilian SOEs. Often this leads to corruption scandals. The President of Brazil, as the chief of the executive power, can appoint 22.500 persons to public positions, far more than the 4.000 in the US, 300 in the UK or 500 in France or Germany, according to Claudio Abramo, from the Non-governmental organization Transparência Brasil.", "Brazilian national SOEs are historically among the most important listed companies in B3 (Brazilian stock exchange). This paper will focus on succession processes at the national SOEs in Brazil listed at B3 and part of the IBOVESPA benchmark index: Banco do Brasil (BB), Eletrobras and Petrobras. We will analyze through a longitudinal study spanning more than two decades the impact of elections and successions in the market value of those companies. During this time span, at least once, all three companies had losses attributed to mismanagement and political use to promote unsustainable policies favored by different governments.", "Thus, analyzing SOE´s performance linked to CEO appointment is relevant for understanding how perceptions of political influence drive market reactions. Brogaard & Detzel (2015) have shown how uncertainty related to government economic policies affect decision making processes of investors and companies in general, being an important risk factor. Election periods are prone to increased uncertainty and outcomes of polarized elections can have dramatic impacts on markets. Bialkowsli, Gottschal & Wisniewski (2006) highlighted that elections processes in 27 OECD countries do promote market volatility.", "Besides market volatility and uncertainty related to government economic policies, elections affect SOEs directly, as changes in top management are dependent on the political process, potentially affecting their strategy. Several conflicts of interest may arise in SOEs, seen as hybrid organizations (Bruton et al., 2014), as they play additional roles given by Government while shareholders complain management does not seek value maximization. Carvalho", "(2014) shows how governments can shape public policies and use SOEs to implement them, favoring political allies in elections.", "The relation of succession and performance in SOEs has additional challenges, as the life cycle of its main executives is subject to the political cycle, with changes in the balance of power in government affecting the top management of those companies. Thus, the relevance of succession on SOEs is paramount but not fully understood.", "Management turnover and CEO succession in SOEs is different than in private peers and linked to the political process. To gather evidence of this phenomenon, we investigated yearly changes in management in official documents filed at CVM, with special attention to changes after election years.", "By analyzing those changes in top management disclosed in official, we have found that the CEO turnover in SOEs is bigger than in private companies and can be linked to the political cycle, which makes relevant to analyze impacts of elections and CEO turnover on market performance.", "After the recent corruption scandals involving SOEs such as Eletrobras and Petrobras and several private groups in Brazil, linked with corruption of politically appointed executives, congress approved law 13.303/2016, strengthening governance requisites, improving transparency, disclosure, risk management and compliance aspects at SOEs, with special attention to executive and board member appointment processes. The law is quite recent but is already being questioned by congressmen that want to soften its requirements.", "Event studies on political events (presidential elections and impeachment processes) and CEO successions at SOEs show that, in several cases, SOE´s market performance was affected and there is evidence of abnormal returns (AR) on event day or cumulative abnormal returns (CAR) around event day. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to combine the analysis of top management changes in documents filed by companies at CVM with quantitative results from short-horizon event studies, which provide unique insight into phenomena that should be more studied: impacts of CEO succession and political process on market prices.", "The structure of this paper proceeds along the following sequence: Section 2 brings a literature review on succession, in Section 3 we introduce data and methodology, Section 4 discusses the results and Section 5 concludes. 2.2 – LITERATURE REVIEW", "Research on CEO succession has attracted many scholars, looking at succession events through different lenses: human resources, planning, strategy, leadership, and finance. Antecedents and consequences of succession, including firm and CEO characteristics, were reviewed in Giambatista, Rowe & Riaz (2005). Research also seeks to identify key ingredients for success in succession and the role of executives in leading companies and driving firm performance. A key variable is the origin of the newly appointed CEO, as insiders (working within the company) and outsiders may face different difficulties but can bring different contributions to the company.", "CEO origin relation to firm performance is one of the most important streams of research. Zhang & Rajagopalan (2010) look at succession processes interested in how firm performance and strategic change varies according to CEO origin. Jalal & Prezas (2012) examine outsider CEO succession and its relationship with firm performance, finding that insider succession provides better immediate results, but outsiders display better stock performance in later years. Ferris, Jayeraman & Lim (2015) summarize sixty years of research over the origin of the successor and capital allocation decisions on dividends, M&A, and investments.", "Industry is another important variable in studying CEO´s succession processes. Industry aspects of succession have been analyzed by Datta & Rajagopalan (1998). Often, the definition of insider has incorporated, besides company-specific, industry-specific knowledge.", "Berns & Klarner (2017) published a comprehensive literature review on CEO succession, trying to understand succession in companies as complex processes rather than isolated events when companies have succession planning.

Greater board independence leads to more rigorous CEO monitoring.", "The relationship between CEO succession and firm performance has been studied by many scholars. Jenter & Kanaan (2015) have shown that CEOs may be dismissed by factors outside their control and Huson, Malatesta & Parrino (2004) have analyzed the impact of successions in firm performance, finding that usually performance declines prior to successions to improve afterwards, both through accounting measures and market performance.", "CEO successions are often related to poor performance or crisis. Gangloff, Connely & Shook (2014) studied investor reactions to executive succession in companies that run into problems of financial misrepresentation, showing that signaling change or scapegoating are successful strategies to overcome them. Connelly et al. (2016) analyze market reactions to new CEOs when companies present integrity or competence failures, finding that a common strategy is to communicate that the problem is gone after the former CEO leaves to restore investor confidence and that the type of successor the firm chooses is a critical aspect of successful communication.", "Shen & Cannella (2003) show that succession is a common concern for investors, with succession planning being part of the strategic discussion within companies. Investors react favorably when the heir apparent is nominated as the new CEO in good performance companies.", "Most of the research on succession is dedicated to developed markets and to widely held companies. The typical agency conflict studied is between shareholders and executives, although notably in companies with relevant shareholders with big influence on management, conflicts between controlling and minority shareholders are common.", "This last type of conflict prevails in emerging markets, where usually companies are not widely held but instead have strong controlling groups. This is", "exactly the case of SOEs on emerging and transition economies, where Government appoints the management of SOEs and often privileges the execution of public policies rather than efficiency or financial performance.", "Crossland & Hambrick (2011) have analyzed the differences in nation-level institutions in 15 OECD countries, showing that managerial discretion varies across countries and institutions, which may limit CEOs role to promote change. According to Crossland & Chen (2009), executive accountability varies across countries, implying in different relations between performance and CEO dismissal. Another understudied question is the role of SOEs in different economies. Christensen (2011) points out that there are 48 listed SOEs in OECD countries, with market value over USD$ 500 billion. The OECD Guidelines on Corporate Governance of State-Owned Enterprises. last updated in 2015, helps understand the challenges of SOEs, which vary in different countries.", "In emerging and transition economies, SOEs have greater presence and importance. Andres, Guasch & Azumendi (2011) look at governance characteristics in energy and water SOEs in Latin American, finding that good governance and regulation are key to mitigate minority expropriation by controlling shareholders. Conflicts of interest in SOEs in emerging economies are a special case of the governance and agency conflicts that affect companies in general in non-OECD markets, as control value is often much higher than market value. Few dedicated studies cover succession in those different market environments.", "Lazzarinni & Musacchio (2015) try to gauge the “CEO-effect” in Brazilian SOEs, looking at a dataset of SOEs from the 70´s to the 90´s. They arrive at the conclusion that a 2% increase in the return on assets can be attributed to a specific CEO, by following CEOs that have taken this position at more than one SOE. They point out that turnover in SOEs is much bigger than on private companies and that spurious effects may affect their analysis. It is hard to compare with SOEs nowadays, after the privatization wave in the 90´s.", "Succession in SOEs have attracted a few studies: Chang & Wong (2009) covered executive turnover in China and its relationship with the multiple objectives of governance in SOEs, highlighting that there is scarce research on monitoring of", "managers but there is direct relationship between managerial turnover, firm financial performance and those multiple objectives.", "Yu & Lee (2016) have analyzed SOE´s performance in Korea in connection to the financial crisis, linking performance with the political connectedness of the CEO´s, showing that biographical information and political relations are important factors for CEOs in SOEs.", "Helmich & Gilroy (2012) shed light on how succession happens in SOEs in China, in a gradualist economic transition environment context, where CEO succession is influenced by the availability of outsider candidates. Silveira & Dias-Junior (2010) have analyzed the impact of bad governance practices in 24 cases of conflicts between shareholder groups reported in the specialized media in a concentrated ownership environment like its typical in Brazil, finding strong evidence of the presence of agency cost reflecting in higher risk and lower share value. Although only two of the 24 cases investigated are related to SOEs, where the government is the controlling shareholder, the conflicts reported highlight how interests diverge between controlling and minority shareholders either by economic or political reasons both in SOEs and in privately controlled companies. Black, De Carvalho & Gorga (2012) compare governance practices in Brazil and other emerging markets, such as Russia, India & Korea. They point out that SOEs may need different governance requirements to achieve optimal governance.

BB, Eletrobras and Petrobras are the only national SOEs stocks in of the IBOVESPA index, representing three different and important sectors of the Brazilian economy: oil & gas, electric energy, and financials. Eletrobras and Petrobras are dual class share companies, and we analyzed both classes, reporting only the most liquid stocks. Although the number of SOEs studied is a limitation, those cases can provide good proxies for succession processes in other SOEs. To try to overcome these limitations, we investigate how succession processes affect differently SOEs, by comparing them with companies that are in the same sectors when possible. Although there are no twin companies, they compete in the same markets and have overall similar characteristics. We will also compare if elections affect those proxies the same way than SOEs.", "The analysis of changes in management after elections and comparisons with private companies also helps to understand the uniqueness of the situations SOEs face. For accessing the changes on each SOE´s in every government transition, members of the board of directors or the executive board in the last year of a term are compared with names in the first year of the next term, according to official information filed at CVM, the Brazilian equivalent of the Securities and Exchange Commission in the US.", "Since the stabilization of the Brazilian economy in 1994, there were six general elections for Presidency. Incumbents on first tenors can run for re-election and every elected president since was able to secure re-election for another term, from Fernando Henrique (FHC) to Dilma Roussef. Dilma was impeached in 2016 and succeed by Vice-President Temer, totaling 7 political processes of interest. As per Table 2.1, tenure of CEO´s of SOEs in Brazil is dependent on political process and affected by general elections. For some of the SOEs studied, CEO´s tenure can be compared to their direct private competitors:  BB´s main competitors faced CEO successions according to succession planning. Itau has changed CEO only once and Bradesco has changed CEOs twice in the period analyzed, while BB had 10 CEOs in the same period.", " Eletrobras, has good proxies in Engie Brasil and in CPFL Energia. Since then, Engie and CPFL Energia had 2 CEOs each, while Eletrobras had 10 CEOs. In fact, Engie was a successful spun-off of Eletrobras privatized in 1997 and the current CEO of Eletrobras spent 18 years as CEO of CPFL Energia.", " For Petrobras, the closest proxy is Ultrapar, also in petrochemicals and fuel distribution.

Elections and CEO successions by political reasons, by affecting management, may impact performance differently than competitors in the sectors they operate. Although succession planning is important, in Brazilian SOEs no succession planning is viable at the top level, because of the impacts of political processes on top management. Clear evidence of this is that CEO turnover in SOEs occurs much more often than privately owned peers.

Event studies are useful, but their limitations are well known. Often, it is hard to untangle effects when other situations happening simultaneously with the event affect the company or the market.", "We analyzed individually three SOEs in seven voting processes, but it is hard to generalize results. In several cases, when it is clear who will be the winner, election dates may not be the best choices for event studies or information linked to election may already be factored in prices at election date. Elections more disputed, with winners defined by a narrow margin, such as Dilma´s reelection in 2014, provoke more uncertainty and generate more frequently abnormal returns. When analyzing individual succession processes, there are often differences between when succession rumors start and when succession takes place. Political negotiations to nominate a new CEO may last for a while. We have only considered succession dates as it is hard to date rumors. Use of windows of different lengths mitigates this concern, but political decisions can take longer than expected. Other factors may affect stock performance surrounding CEO succession dates and event studies may not capture them. Crisis is a common factor for succession, but a CEO may be replaced even when doing a good job if he misses political support.

EVIDENCE FROM BRAZIL", "Abstract This paper analyzes the relation between firm performance and CEO turnover, moderated by corporate governance and control structure. While CEO turnover is usually associated with negative firm performance, it can also be affected by corporate governance quality and control characteristics. We use a unique dataset of CEO turnover of Brazilian firms from 2010 to 2017, including many that voluntarily adopt good governance practices through listing on “Novo Mercado” segment. We find a negative relation between CEO turnover and firm performance, which indicates that low performance increases the likelihood of CEO turnover. We also document that firms with good governance practices tend to change CEOs more frequently than traditional firms, probability due to increased monitoring of their main executives. Family companies are affected by governance practices, with family companies listed on Novo Mercado being more sensitive to performance and changing CEOs more often than family companies not listed on Novo Mercado,", "Keywords: CEO turnover; firm performance; corporate governance; ownership", "3.1- INTRODUCTION", "CEO turnover has been a relevant issue for the investor and academic communities for decades, as it represents change in status quo with potential effects in firm performance and strategic decisions.

In the most important developed markets, governance enforcement is strong and dispersed ownership prevails. Unfortunately, not much is known about CEO turnover in emerging markets, where data is scarce and governance conditions may be quite different.", "This paper analyzes and provides original insight into the relation between CEO turnover, corporate governance quality and ownership structure. One distinguishing feature of this article is the use of a unique dataset on CEO turnover and voluntary adoption of good governance practices. Brazil offers an interesting case study because many Brazilian firms voluntarily enlisted on “Novo Mercado” (NM), a special segment created by B3, the Brazilian stock exchange, to improve corporate governance in Brazil (Black, De Carvalho & Sampaio, 2014). Our results indicate that companies that voluntarily adopt good governance practices through listing on NM change CEO more frequently than traditional firms, especially in family-controlled companies.

Understanding CEO turnover in different geographies, with various governance environments, is relevant to expanding knowledge in a local and global scale.", "Only a few studies addressed CEO turnover in Brazil, and none found strong performance influence in CEO turnover. Furthermore, no research has investigated how listing on NM segment affects CEO turnover.

NM companies often earn premium valuations compared to traditional companies. This has made the NM listing the preferred configuration for Brazilian companies willing to list shares, as it is the most appealing for investors. More than 100 companies where listed on this segment since 2001 through public offers, predominantly bought by foreign institutional investors. This setting provides an interesting landscape for research, as companies who adopt higher levels of governance may have different practices regarding CEO and executive turnover in Brazilian listed companies have different characteristics than large corporations in common law countries, (Black, De Carvalho & Gorga, 2010). Companies in Brazil typically have lower board independence, higher ownership concentration and their control is typically on the hands of families and large groups. These differences in governance and ownership structure can make CEOs goals and mandates quite different from those in developed countries.", "Brazil´s unique setting has an important appeal, as NM listing has provided a domestic alternative to cross-listing for attracting international investors, reinforcing the “bonding hypothesis” (Coffee Jr., 1999) in a Brazilian context (Black, De Carvalho CEO turnovers are usually turning points for companies and the relation of performance and CEO turnover is a hot theme in academia.

Jenter & Kanaan (2015) show that relative performance can be a major factor explaining CEO turnover. Jenter & Lewellen (2017) discuss the underestimation of forced turnovers and propose a new classification that can better explore the relationship between performance and turnover, naming it performance- induced turnover. In fact, corporate communication seldom explicit “top executives are fired”, and often use a conservative language to “thank the executives leaving to pursue their own endeavors”.", "CEO importance for firm performance is paramount. Bennedsen, Pérez- González & Wolfenzon (2020) highlight this by showing that even CEO temporary absences due to hospitalization affect firm performance and increase the likelihood of a CEO turnover.", "Performance problems may be the result of bad CEO decisions. Chulkov & Barron (2018) relate CEO turnover to the de-escalation of commitment, where new management will be less attached to previous decisions that proved wrong. Barron, Chulkov & Waddell (2011) argue that CEO turnover and succession processes often send a message to investors about possible changes in strategic priorities, often increasing the level of discontinued operations. Several motivations can contribute to a CEO turnover decision. The board may be unsatisfied with CEO´s performance in a broad sense or the CEO may have a better offer in the market or decide to leave the company for personal reasons. In real life, the actual relation is subject to factors not only related to firm performance or to how the CEO is evaluated by the board but also to corporate governance and ownership structure.", "Farah et al.

Balsam, Kwack & Lee (2017) highlight that the number of CEO family connections affect turnover, which gives evidence that family-controlled companies may have different CEO turnover patterns. Gao, Harford & Li (2017) show that public companies in the US have higher CEO turnover-performance sensitivity than private firms due to the role of investors in monitoring companies´ performance.

Our sample represents more than 90% of all listed companies in Brazil and has 2103 firm-years observations. Market data and accounting data come from Economatica, a database with information of Brazilian companies listed at B3. We collect the information on CEO turnover, governance practices and ownership structure through queries to mandatory data filed by companies at CVM (Brazilian Securities Exchange Commission) through R package GetDFPData by Perlin, Kirch & Vancin (2019). Companies must file yearly financial statements at CVM, disclosing the CEO and the IR Directors, who sign the financial statements. In fact, in 18.95% of the observations the CEO is also the IR Director. We identify 348 CEO turnovers in our sample. Most companies (217 out of 298 companies) have at least one CEO turnover during the sample period. There are 6 companies with more than 3 CEOs in this period. 4 of them faced deep financial trouble, having filed for asset restructuring, one had to make impairments due to fraud and the last one is a SOE (State-owned enterprise).", "An important factor in analyzing companies´ corporate governance is the existence of a controlling group. In Brazil, most companies have controlling shareholders and there are not many opportunities for market disputes of corporate control, which limit incentives for minority shareholders to discipline managers. Controlling shareholder´s objectives may differ from profit maximization to all shareholders, making governance problems vary according to different types of control, related to the origin of the largest shareholder (families, foreigners, State, Brazilian private groups, institutional investors or dispersed capital), which is another aspect to consider on CEO turnover-performance sensitivity.

Our main goal in this research is not to predict CEO turnover but to generate stylized facts that can enhance our knowledge about governance and control influence on CEO turnover and help investors and firms handle those events from a market perspective.", "Notwithstanding those more limited objectives, we pursued additional robustness tests to ensure that our findings can be confirmed and that most problems commonly found in empirical finance research were addressed.", "In all regression models, we check for multicollinearity (variance inflation factors are well below 5), heteroskedasticity (through Box-Cox transformations and tests) and autocorrelation (through Breusch-Godfrey Tests).", "We ran the same regressions presented at Table 3.7 and Table 3.8 but looking at the replacement of the IR Director instead of the CEO ( the same person accumulates both positions in 18% of the observations). For the IR Director, firm performance is a significant variable, with poor performance enhancing the odds of replacement in Table 3.7 and Table 3.8. Nonetheless there are important differences, with important variables that were relevant for CEO turnover, like the interaction of NM and control / types of control, not being significant in general. Lagged performance is also not relevant for IR director.", "To mitigate endogeneity concerns and strengthen the argument that NM listing makes a difference on CEO turnover for Family controlled companies, we ran 2-step regressions to implement Heckman corrections and look at omitted variables, shown in table 3.10, with the first regression looking just at the relation of IR director turnover and firm performance (selection formula) and the second one looking at CEO turnover outcomes related to size, leverage and NM listing interacting with control/types of control.", "Table 3.10 –Heckman correction as robustness test on Table 3.8 results for CEO turnover", "Variables (I) ROA (II) ROA (III) ROE (IV) ROE (V) Stock return (VI) Stock return Selection equation on Turn_IR Firm performance Key Obs: coefficients (and p-values in parentheses) are reported. ***, ** and * to indicate statistical significance at 1%, 5% and 10%, respectively.", "In Table 3,10, firm performance (ROA, ROE, and stock return) was negative and significant in 5 of the 6 models used. Control was significant in 2 out of 3 models", "and NM listing in 2 out of 6, with interactions of NM and control/types of control also being significant.", "Family dummy (FAM) was significant in all specifications. The inverse Mills ratio was only significant using stock return as the performance metric, which shows that when using ROA and ROE, selection bias is not a significant issue. Those results reinforce our findings that having a controlling shareholder and adhering to higher governance quality can have an influence in CEO turnover Another test using Heckman corrections was made restricting our database to Family companies, which has the largest number of observations in our sample, confirming that stock return and NM variables are significant at 5% level. The inverse Mills ratio was not significant in any model.", "Additionally, if we restrict our database just to NM companies, FAM remains statistically significant in regression VI in Table 3.8 while if we restrict the database to non-NM companies and run the regressions in Table 3.8, SOEs becomes statistically significant in models II, IV and VI and FOR is statistically significant in model VI. To obtain further confirmation we tested if relative performance would confirm our findings when used in lieu of absolute performance metrics in our models. Overall results don´t change, showing that the performance metrics chosen are relevant and that both absolute and relative performance metrics can be useful in modeling CEO turnover. Overall results show that NM listing increases CEO turnover sensitiveness in companies with controlling shareholders, especially in FAM companies. Finally, regarding causality, we ran Granger causality tests with 1-period lag between performance metrics and CEO turnover. We found that poor performance (ROA) leads to CEO turnover with statistical significance at the 5% level, and not the other way around, with the other tests being non-significant.", "3.5 – CONCLUSIONS", "In general, the most important factor for CEO turnover is firm performance. However, companies´ effectiveness to monitor executives and timeliness to promote change when necessary may depend on corporate governance and ownership structure, as executives are named or fired by the board, elected as agents of shareholders, another typical principal-agent problem.", "Although it is very hard to define exactly why and when a decision to change a CEO has to be made, we know that boards look at different measures of performance, both past and current, as part of their mandate, given by shareholders, to elect a new CEO when necessary.", "Current firm performance is more important than lagged performance, showing that boards can react quickly when performance deteriorates. Boards will react to different performance measures. Our results are consistent with Miyajima, Ogawa & Saito (2017) results in Japan, showing how accounting performance metrics and stock returns are important predictors of turnover and provide different information to board members.", "We argue that the board willingness to promote change will depend also on ownership/control structure that ultimately appoints the board. The rules of the game that the board must follow are also quite important. For instance, in Brazil boards that must comply with NM requirements are more prone to change CEOs when performance deteriorates, as minority shareholders have more say in board nominations and may influence more controlling shareholders. Hence, complying with NM requirements has impacts that interact with different types of control affecting CEO-performance sensitiveness.", "It is more likely that minority shareholders can push for a CEO turnover in a corporation than in family-controlled company or a SOE. On the other hand, companies with controlling shareholders can monitor management better, and create more effective pay-performance schemes with better alignment of interests between management and shareholders. There is no universal governance solution that guaranties ideal monitoring of executives, but improving corporate governance is positive for investors.", "The combination of governance and control characteristics help explain the CEO-performance sensitiveness among companies by defining what is expected from the board (rules of the games) by whom (controlling shareholders). Most research on CEO turnover focus on developed countries. We contribute to the existing literature by evaluating the relation between CEO turnover and corporate governance in a country with weak legal environment. This paper analyzes the CEO turnover of Brazilian firms, highlighting the role that voluntarily adopting", "good governance practices through listing on “Novo Mercado” segment has on CEO turnover sensitivity. We also document how differences in control/ownership impact CEO turnover sensitivity and how this interacts with NM listing. This is the first work, to the best of our knowledge, to incorporate a governance dimension related to NM listing in analyzing CEO turnover in Brazil and to establish evidence of a negative relation between firm performance and CEO turnover in a broad sample of Brazilian companies, using different performance metrics and model specifications, showing that low-performing firms are more likely to change CEOs, especially when corporate governance favors the CEO turnover sensitiveness.", "Another relevant finding is the material change that NM has in family- controlled companies CEO turnover. Mendes-da-Silva & Grzybovski (2006) found that for family companies CEO turnover was less sensitive to financial performance, when in fact here CEO turnover for family-controlled NM companies is above average and related to negative financial performance, providing evidence that good governance practices have a positive and significant effect on CEO turnover and can alter patterns related to the control/ownership structure.", "There is important heterogeneity on how companies approach governance, and how control is exerted by different controlling shareholders. While family companies have a natural bond between controlling shareholders and foreign companies have often to follow headquarters or global RH practices to selecting executives, PE companies have a big interest in exit strategies and SOEs management are influenced by political processes. Another aspect to be considered is that often the existence of a shareholders´ agreement will grant a specific shareholder the right to appoint someone to a management position of CEO or CFO. Future studies could explore the role of shareholders´ agreements as they might shape how controlling shareholders appoint executives. The incorporation of additional governance variables and the use of quarterly data could also be useful to understanding the role of corporate governance and of changes in firm performance in CEO turnover.", "3.6 - REFERENCES", "ADAMS, R.; KELOHARJU, M.; KNUPFER, S.

We use a unique dataset of CEO and executive turnover of Brazilian firms from 2010 to 2017, including companies that voluntarily adopt good governance practices through listing on “Novo Mercado” segment. We document a significant growth in turnover activity throughout the sample period and find negative relation between firm performance and CEO and executive turnover, which indicates that low performance increases the likelihood of CEO and executive turnover. We also document that firms with good governance practices have greater CEO and executive performance sensitivity, changing executives more often when firm performance deteriorates. Control and Industry characteristics may influence corporate governance characteristics and industry performance is more important to executive turnover than to CEO turnover.", "Keywords : executive turnover; CEO turnover; firm performance; corporate governance", "4.1 – INTRODUCTION", "Agency theory contributes to corporate governance by acknowledging that management (agents) are selected by shareholders (principals) to act on their behalf but agents may have conflicts of interest with shareholders objectives. One of the usual solutions to this problem is to promote alignment of interests between shareholders and management through compensation and variable remuneration. This could promote value maximization and mitigate agency risks. Balsam, Fernando & Tripathy (2011) provide evidence that compensation is linked to the strategy pursued, as defined by the board.", "Nonetheless, when there are governance problems by conflicts among shareholders or when there is poor oversight of management, incentives can be misused or promote maximization of private wealth of the controlling group or of management (Bae et al., 2012 ; Bebchuk & Fried , 2013 ).", "One of the key functions of the board is to monitor top executives and make sure that value maximization is sought after, promoting changes in management teams whenever poor performance is not justified. Board composition and independent board members are especially important to filter and mitigate conflicts of interest and promote better corporate governance (Lu & Boateng, 2017). The base case of agent theory is about dispersed ownership, but in several countries, like Brazil, companies usually have controlling shareholders and conflicts of interest may be more often related to conflicts between controlling and minority shareholders. CEO and executive turnover performance sensitiveness may be affected by controlling aspects, as the objective function for value maximization may differ depending on controlling shareholders characteristics, with different objectives for SOEs, foreign and family-controlled companies, for instance.", "CEO and executive turnover are critical processes that companies face from time to time and where their corporate governance is tested. Often, a new CEO is selected from the Top Management Team (TMT) or a TMT member leaves the company because of performance issues or internal conflicts. So, by analyzing not only CEO turnover sensitiveness, but also general changes in the TMT through differences in executive turnover sensitivity, we can enhance governance knowledge about boards capacity to fulfill their duties.", "CEO and executive turnover may also be impacted by industry characteristics. Differences in performance in the same industry might be caused by strategic choices but tend to be smaller than differences in other industries. Industry can also shape governance characteristics like TMT and board size, that might be important to explain CEO and executive turnover.", "The relationship between negative performance and TMT turnover is well established but not universal as pointed by Messersmith et al. (2014). Also, termination may be provoked by the company or by the executive. The board may be unsatisfied, or the executive may have a better offer in the market or planning a different life stylus. Additionally, age and tenure are in general unrelated to performance but considered relevant aspects in turnover, being used in classifications of turnovers as forced or voluntary. In fact, the actual relation of performance and turnover is subject to several other factors, some case specific, others related to the governance and ownership structure.", "Researchers have looked at the quality of the fit of the a given CEO(executive) and its company, trying to understand why a specific CEO/executive is chosen by a board and when a mismatch is perceived and a turnover is recommended. The mismatch may be caused by new events or new information about the executive ability to cope with the job. Anderson et al. (2018) show how the mismatch arises from a change in the firm’s external circumstances while Hermalin & Weisbach (2012) provide a model of CEO dismissals that presumes that shareholders learn information about the CEO’s ability over time, which they relate to improved disclosure.", "When CEO/executive turnover takes place, corporate communication is usually laconic. Specialized media and sell-side analysts try to explain the reasons why each turnover happens and what are new management´s objectives but in general the real discussion in board rooms is unknown.", "Romance of leadership theory (Meindl, Ehrlich & Dukerich, 1985) has questioned the real contribution of CEOs to firm performance, but nowadays there is overwhelming evidence that leadership is important to performance in many fields.", "Every company will eventually face a change in leadership, making those processes important events. The same is true for other executives in the C-Suite and in top management in general. Researchers have been trying to understand succession and turnover events for decades, and its growing importance has not only caught the attention of investors but has been also discussed by society at large, with perceptions of excessive pay being an issue. This raises the question of the real contribution of top executives to firm performance. In the case of CEO contribution this is known as the “CEO effect” (Quigley & Hambrick, 2013; Serra, Três & Ferreira, Some of the questions are related not only to why turnover happens but also who the new successor is, and what are his new plans and strategic directions for the company. The origin of the successor is one of the aspects considered, with internal succession seen as less disruptive than external succession. Upper echelons theory (Hambrick; Mason,1984; Hambrick, 2007) links organizational performance with managerial background characteristics.", "While the exact causes of mismatches between executives and companies are hard to grasp, it is common sense that performance is a strong candidate. A derived question is which performance metric is considered most relevant in literature and which ones are considered important and used by board members in each company. Although general corporate performance metrics are important to top management members, individual members may be evaluated by specific metrics related to their specific responsibilities.", "Another important aspect is the frequency and intensity of CEO/TMT turnover. Executive turnover is expected to happen at some point in any company and in fact changes in the top management team are relatively frequent. Some level of turnover may happen almost every year, but there is also the perception that executive life cycle is shortening. CEO turnovers are still somewhat rare although the growth in turnover rates has been coined by Charan (2005) as a CEO succession crisis. Senior management often can move to other high-profile positions. Boivie et al. (2012) presented a theory about factors that make directors depart from companies by their own choice.", "Warren Buffet2 has offered advice on how management should be judged, by looking at their results in comparison to peers and how they treat shareholders, giving relative performance and corporate governance an important weight in management evaluation. His letters3 to Berkshire Hathaway’s shareholders show his stance on pay-performance and board role to monitor management provide good practical advice on governance practices that enhance shareholder value (Cunningham, 2000).", "This highlights the importance of corporate governance and of the expected contribution of management to firm performance, which are relevant topics to any investor. It also highlights the role of functional boards in promoting good governance and enhancing CEO/executive turnover sensitiveness.", "In this context, analyzing industry performance and the interrelation of governance, performance, industry, and control is important to understand CEO and executive turnover processes, which are often intertwined.", "Although the complexity of these processes and the scarcity of complete information naturally imply in blurred perceptions of reality, investigations about some known stylized facts and important factors that impact turnover such as firm performance, corporate governance and industry aspects may provide guidance to decision makers in boards and in the asset management industry.", "In Brazil, an additional aspect to be considered is the emergence and growth of differentiated governance segments since 2001, with the introduction of “Novo Mercado” (NM). The NM has the highest level of governance in Brazil, minimizing governance conflicts with controlling shareholders and management, often implying on premium valuations. NM listing is the preferred configuration for Brazilian companies willing to list shares. More than 100 companies listed on NM segment through public offers, predominantly bought by foreign institutional investors. Brazil´s unique setting is an unexplored one with an important appeal, as so far we hear only fuzzy narratives of CEO and executive turnover, with no in-depth investigation on the role of corporate governance, firm performance and industry", "2 An interview with Warren Buffet´s comments on management is available at https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/08/warren-buffett-heres-how-to-judge-management.html", "3 https://www.berkshirehathaway.com/letters/letters.html", "variables in CEOs and executive turnover been presented so far, to the best of our knowledge.", "We investigated CEO and executive turnover relation to firm performance in Brazil and found that there is a negative relation that is moderated by governance, ownership, and industry variables.", "The rest of this paper is organized as follows.

By looking from different angles, the authors describe CEO succession as complex processes that companies often must face.", "Farah et al. (2019) showed in a systematic review how different types of organizations, from public listed to privately owned companies, but also to governments and political organizations. All organizations must deal with the same phenomenon (leadership turnover) where performance is a key factor and political organization context is another one that moderates the impacts of performance. CEO turnover is a widely researched topic that continues to have importance as new settings and variables are incorporated in different studies. For instance, the divergence between earnings performance measures and analyst expectations is related to CEO turnover in Jarva, Kalunki & Livne (2019) while Balsam, Kwack & Lee (2017) highlight that the number of CEO family connections affect executive turnover, which gives evidence that family-controlled companies may have different executive turnover patterns.", "TMT turnover is also an important topic, but there are fewer studies dedicated to the relation of performance and executive turnover in general, as the importance and contribution of each member of the TMT to overall performance may vary but is believed to be always smaller than that of the CEO. Fee & HADLOCK (2004) find that executive turnover is related to performance as CEO turnover and is elevated by CEO turnover events, due to the team nature of dismissals. Messersmith et al. (2011)", "relate executive turnover probability with pay dispersion on the TMT. Andrus et al. (2019) investigate why executives decide they should depart a top position in a company.", "Karaevli (2007) investigates the performance consequences of the new CEO “outsiderness”, which is related to how the new CEO fit in the TMT and if this is linked to additional executive turnover. Tian, Haleblian & Rajagopalan (2010) discuss the relation of the CEO and the board using the internal social capital they accumulate by working together. Previous experiences in the same sector or previous experiences working together with other key members when the successor is an insider may mitigate performance consequences of a CEO turnover.", "Barron, Chulkov & Waddell (2011) analyzed the relation of CEO and TMT turnover to the origin of the successor and to discontinued operations. Both the origin of the successor and the mandate to promote change and improve performance are key themes for researchers.", "Messersmith et al. (2014) show that the rate of departure of TMT members can have negative performance consequences but moderate rates of TMT turnover can have positive effects on innovation and change, highlighting the complex and non-linear relations between TMT turnover and performance.", "Boyne et al. (2011) examined TMT turnover in local governments in England, and also find evidence a non-linear pattern where top management team turnover is adaptive at low levels of baseline performance but disruptive at high levels, with little impact at middle levels of baseline performance.", "Although different research streams focus on various aspects of CEO and executive turnover, they are interconnected, and those differences should also be explored to reconcile common findings. Several turnover studies focus on specific industries looking also at ownership dimensions (He & Sommer, 2011; Cheng, Cummins & Lin, 2015; Shen & Wang ,2019) One important source of executive turnover is M&A activity, which can also affect the number of companies listed. Bilgili et al. (2016) use meta-analysis and structural equations and find that executive turnover is key in post-acquisition performance.", "There are often discussions on which performance metric is ideal to establish what would be the role of performance to CEO and executive turnover, which may be specific by decisions by boards for each company and each executive. There are also some controversies regarding the use of relative and absolute performance. Jenter & Kanaan (2015) show that relative performance can be a major factor explaining CEO turnover, but Fee et al. (2017) pose arguments that absolute performance should be preferred due to robustness in models of CEO turnover. Miyajima, Ogawa & Saito (2017) find that in Japan, where important transformations happened in the governance landscape, top executive is influenced by relative performance. Also, over time, CEO turnover sensitivity has shifted from ROA to ROE and stock return, which represent better the interest of shareholders. Volpin (2002) provides evidence of the relation of poor governance and executive turnover in Italy, where sensitivity of performance and the probability of turnover are affected by corporate governance, ownership, and control structure. Morresi (2005) also investigates turnover in Italian companies and finds that privately owned companies face fewer turnover events than public listed companies and among them, SOEs have greater likelihood of turnover. Another finding is that accounting metrics matter more than market returns for turnovers.", "González et al. (2014) investigate how corporate governance affects CEO turnover in the Colombian landscape, finding evidence that family firms have reduced CEO turnover and that the presence of family members in management reduces the CEO performance sensitivity.", "Defond & Hung (2004) discuss the importance of corporate governance to understanding CEO turnover-performance sensitivity worldwide. They show that investor protection rights interact with firm performance to define the CEO turnover- performance sensitivity in different realities.", "Jenter & Lewellen (2017) discuss the underestimation of forced turnovers and propose a new classification that can better explore the relationship between firm performance and CEO turnover, naming it performance-induced turnover. There is further evidence that forced turnover is underestimated (Fee et al, 2017; Kaplan & Minton, 2012). In fact, corporate communication seldom makes explicit that “top", "executives are fired”, and often use tone down language to “thank the executives leaving to pursue their own endeavors”.", "A few papers in Brazil (mostly in Portuguese) investigate CEO and executive turnover, but we lack more recent and comprehensive work that incorporates the governance, ownership, and industry dimensions.", "Mellone Jr. & Saito (2004) analyze the monitoring role of boards to promote executive turnover in Brazil and find no relation between stock performance and CEO turnover but a negative relation between performance and executive turnover. They investigate the role of independent board members and of CEO/Chairman duality in CEO turnover, but NM listing already guaranties larger number of independent board members and forbids CEO duality (since 2014).", "Mendes-da-Silva & Moraes (2004, 2006) find weak evidence of the relationship of TMT turnover and performance in Brazil. Mendes-da-Silva & Grzybovski (2006) show that the relation between CEO turnover and financial performance is less important in family firms than in non-family companies. Vieira & Martins (2018) investigated CEO turnover in companies that are part of IBOVESPA and IBRx100 indexes, looking at the relation of absolute and relative (to the indexes) stock returns and CEO turnover, investigating also ownership concentration, independence of the board and CEO/Chairman duality influence. Their results highlight the influence of firm performance on CEO turnover and of CEO duality and ownership concentration but not of independence of the board. Black, De Carvalho & Sampaio (2014) and Leal, Carvalhal & Iervolino (2015) have documented important evolution of corporate governance in Brazil related to the introduction of special governance segments at the B3, with the NM segment standing out as the highest standard and preferred choice for issuers and investors. This remarkable evolution set the way for new investigations regarding CEO and executive turnover and executive performance sensitiveness.", "4.3 – Data and Methodology", "This study analyzes CEO and executive turnovers of 267 Brazilian listed companies we obtained complete data, from 2010 to 2017. Our sample represents more than 80% of all listed companies in Brazil and has 1919 firm-years observations. Market data and accounting data come from Economatica, a database that contains information of Brazilian companies. We collect the information on CEO and executive turnover, governance practices and ownership structure as well as executive and company data through queries to mandatory data filed by companies at Brazilian Securities Exchange Commission (CVM) through R package GetDFPData by Perlin, Kirch & Vancin (2019).", "To understand the role of corporate governance in monitoring and replacing executives, we can compare corporate performances directly, specially to peers in the same industry and examine the sensitivity of the relation of top management turnover and firm performance.", "An important factor in analyzing companies´ governance is the existence of a controlling group, as minority investors may have limited say on approval of strategies or corporate actions. In Brazil, most companies have controlling shareholders and there are not many opportunities for market disputes of corporate control, which limit incentives for minority shareholders to discipline managers. Also, minority shareholders rights may depend on specific segment governance rules. This can make CEO and executive turnover-performance sensitivity depend on company´s controlling shareholders and corporate governance.", "NM segment rules, by having the highest governance standards in Brazil, can have an important impact on CEO and executive turnover by improving minority shareholders rights and requiring greater independence in board composition.

Additionally, deeper investigations into specific characteristics of each type of control and the existence and impact of shareholders´ agreements on board and executive appointment may provide further insights and increase our understanding of how control is exerted and influences CEO and executive turnover.", "4.6 - REFERENCES", "ANDERSON, R.W.; BUSTAMANTE, M.C. ; GUIBAUD, S.; ZERVOS, M.

Our findings shed light on important aspects for managing and investing in listed companies in Brazil.", "The first essay brought interesting insights about how political events impact SOEs, making their CEO and executive succession processes unique and their top executive turnover rates greater than private peers.", "SOEs are a sometimes-forgotten topic in academia although their presence is widespread. In fact, mainstream economists rightly defend Central Bank and regulatory agency independence, but there is not the same interest in SOEs. The role of corporate governance cannot be underestimated, and many corporate problems can be related to governance issues. Governance and cultural aspects can potentially help explain governance and performance problems in SOEs, also helping to explain why there were some institutions more affected by problems than others.", "SOEs have specific corporate governance problems that often are caused by the governments that control them and that may use SOEs to gather political support. Investors should be aware that political events, unrelated to business activities but related to governance, can cause abnormal returns, bringing additional risks to investors.", "There was some improvement with the new law for SOEs (Law no 13.393/2016), but even so there were still problems of undue government interference since the enaction of the law. Public policy discussion about their governance can enhance accountability and help discussing privatization when it makes sense.", "The second and third essays complement each other by looking at CEO and executive turnover in listed companies in general, highlighting the moderating role of corporate governance and of NM listing in turnover performance sensitiveness, across different types of control.", "The second essay discuss specifically the importance of corporate governance to CEO performance sensitiveness, being the first study to show in a broad sample that firm performance is negatively related to CEO turnover in Brazil and that corporate governance moderate this relation, with being listed on NM segment and having specific types of control (family and foreign controlled companies, and SOEs) corresponding to different CEO performance sensitiveness. It also finds that NM segment made a huge difference on family-controlled companies, reversing what Mendes-da-Silva & Grzybovski (2006) found. Family- controlled companies had CEO turnover less sensitive to financial performance but now this is reversed for family-controlled NM companies, as they have above average CEO turnover and greater CEO turnover sensitiveness. With CEO turnover being related to negative financial performance by governance changes, there is evidence that good governance practices have a positive and significant effect on CEO turnover, changing patterns related to the control/ownership structure. The third essay complements the second one in several ways: it incorporates executive turnover beyond CEO turnover, document growth in turnover rates, adds an industry dimension, includes other corporate governance variables including TMT and board sizes and board composition and addresses both relative and absolute performance in analyzing CEO performance sensitiveness and focus on family controlled companies, the most relevant group in our sample.", "Executive turnover is related to CEO turnover and, as firm performance, is affected by those events. There are some differences also, as industry performance is more important for executive turnover than for CEO turnover.", "Firm performance in models exploring CEO and executive turnover and incorporating other variables related to industry performance and corporate governance bring additional light and understanding to turnover processes. By looking at additional corporate governance variables, like board size and composition, it highlights the role of NM listing and changes in corporate governance, like identifying that the number of executives with a seat on the board matters for executive and CEO turnover, that presented significant growth throughout the period. This thesis brings important findings related to corporate governance, ownership, and industry influence in CEO and executive turnover. Previous research", "by Mellone Jr. & Saito(2004) has not found general relation between firm performance and CEO and executive turnover, but here with more data and exploring models in a new setting it was possible to confirm this negative relation. Family companies and SOEs have quite different patterns of CEO and executive turnover sensitiveness. Furthermore, corporate governance differences can moderate turnover performance sensitiveness.", "As suggestions for future research, the use of variations of performance and turnover metrics may complement the findings here. Other performance metrics may be relevant and were previously used in literature like ROI, EBITDA, Tobin´s Q and sales growth. Different measures of executive turnover can also be of interest, including looking at quarterly results, closer to turnover events, as well as changes in board composition and in the shareholder base. Event studies over many CEO turnovers could also explore market reactions to those events.", "Literature usually classifies turnovers in forced or voluntary, which could be useful to the analysis of CEO and executive turnover and of performance sensitiveness. On the same line, classifying successors as insiders or outsiders could also help to differentiate the consequences of a turnover process. Another interesting investigation could dig in personal characteristics of the executives involved in the turnover processes as international experience has pointed out that personal traits can have an impact on firm performance.", "As corporate performance is measured through accounting/financial metrics and market returns, similar investigations could address the role of CFOs in establishing financial policies and in capital allocation. The relation of those decisions to performance and to executive turnover are interesting research themes. Qualitative research would be helpful to reveal subjective parameters used in different boards to hire and fire executives. Boards decisions in each case may also reveal information about the role of the origin of the successor (insider/outsider) and when the turnover was voluntary or forced, gathering data still not available and hard to quantify."]}

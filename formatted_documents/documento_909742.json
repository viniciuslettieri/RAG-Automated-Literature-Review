(R. Matesanz et al., 2017) .Transplant surgery is usually performed in hospitals far from those where the potential donor is loca ted. Thus, a process is demanded where multiple professionals and institutions are involved since the identification, diagnosis of brain death, family reque st, surgery for recovery, allocation and distribution of organs are highly complex steps and not nec essarily coupled. (MANYALICH et al., 2011) . Unlike organ donation that can only occur while there is blood circulation, tissue donation can be performed within a few hours after the circulatory arrest.

The basic difference between these m odels refers to the management of the process and the location of the professional specialist in donation. (RUDGE et al., 2012) The Brazilia n transplantation law allows the adhesion of the 2 models for procurement in the national territory.

(LENZI et al., 2014 ; BONFADINI et al., 2014 ). We sought to study organizational innovations from a theoretical perspective, for research that could add knowledge in an original way to the area of organ and tissue donation within the innovation implementation organization theories. We identified ma ny similarities between the role of IHC and realized that their activities fit perfectly into the middle managers models described in literature. (S. A. BIRKEN et al., 2012) Throughout the 3 papers that compose this thesis, we will present an association between the role of IHC and middle managers. The process of implementing the IHC program will be presented in the context of organ and tissue donation to bring a wide list of activities and strategies carried out by transplant coordinators, which can assist the future implementation of IHC in other units at the local level, but also in several other regions and countries. This work will also provide a theoretical contribution to middle managers theory, by the identification of a new domain in which in -house transplant coordinators influence sustainability of the system.", "Keywords : Innovation, Implementation, Healthcare, Donation, Transplantation RESUMO", "SARLO, Rodrigo Alves.

The two -dimension framework represented the direction of influence upon strategy (upward or downward) and the extent to which their influence impacts organization’s concept of strategy and improve its performance. (WOOLDRIDGE ; FLOYD 1990; FLOYD ; WOOLDRIDGE , 1992 ; FLOYD ; WOOLDRIDGE , 1997 ). Some of the roles that would be later categorized by Birken (2012) in the implementation of innovations were introduced, but with a focus on innovation. (S. A. BIRKEN ; LEE; WEINER, 2012)", "Figure 1.1: Typology of middle management involvement in st rategy. Adapted from (FLOYD & WOOLDRIDGE ,", "Castelani (1992) reported issues related to the implementation in an article that examined lessons learned from the closing of 6 large institutions in New York. The ability to generate a connection between strategy and rout ine, mediating political decisions, dealing with the community and various stakeholders and nego tiating contracts , provide a broad look, with an important social role of middle managers .", "A survey was performed in order to identify the relationship betwee n the managerial strategy of middle management and nurse commitment in Australian hospitals. The study re ported a degree of distrust of nurses, relating to centralized decisions made by top managers . The increased commitment of these professionals was rela ted to the involvement of their participation in decision making process, provided by the middle managers mediation. (BREWER; LOK, 1995) . This research reiterates the strategic role and capacity for change that these profe ssionals can bring to the organization", "Miller described the proces s of converting a nurse manager to an interdisciplinary team leader, during the implementation of a patient -centered care model in New York City. The study reports positive outcomes through the development of leadership skills for the benefit of the organi zation and the patient. Coordination by nurses shortened the length of stay and improved communication between staff members .(MILLER , 1999)", "The strate gic alignment as part of a public policy in the United Kingdom (UK) , focusing on middle managers was described by Clifford (2001) . The North Wes t Change Centre (NWCC) programmes “were designed, in part, to provide middle managers with a context in which to place modernization for both local government and the NHS (National Health Service) ”. In addition to the introduction of the proposed moderniza tion agenda, partnership and collaboration are made with seniors managers and management theories and techniques are introduced .(CLIFFORD , 2001) . A framework was created to illustrate relationship between professionals and their organiza tions (fig 1.2). These programs dem onstrate the relevance of middle managers to the process of large -scale change to the healthcare system .", "Figure 1.2: Strategic alignment between middle managers and their organizations. Adapted from (CLIFFORD ,", "Information, training and empowerment were identified as key elements of the implementation of a Quality System in three clinical laboratories, assessing constructs as leadership, goals, client focus, management by fact and process improvement. Despite identifying an important role for middle managers in the dissemination o f information, the study attributed the responsibili ty of leading the change to top managers . (SILOAHO et al., 2001)", "To address a deeper c omprehension of interactions between upper and middl e managers and how they affect decision -making process, Pappas et al . (2004) performed a survey with a middle -management team in one hospital with 386 beds and 2000 employees. Results indicated that middl e managers exert significant influence upon top mana gers through championing new ideas and synthesizing information. Authors defined this construct as the “interpretation and evaluation of information that alters top management perspective.” (PAPPAS et al., 2004 , p.9). Later, Birken et al. expanded and included employees in this spectrum . (S. A. BIRKEN et al.,", "Middle managers may facilitate the changing process within em ployees through the developing of new strategies and shaping the organizational culture. Ham stated that this could be made by the “engagement of clinicians to bring about changes, developing and strengthening of clinical leadership, and provision of profe ssionals with the time, resources, information, and skills needed to achieve change” (HAM, 2003 , p.1980 ). Top managers should empower middle managers to help them create a leadership climate and this may improve delivery of care. (VALENTINO, 2004 ; CARNEY , 2006 )", "Dopson and Fitzgerald (2006) also advocated empowerment for middle managers, when their role was assessed in the implementation of evidence -based healthcare. But the authors added that these professionals also need to be proactive and “negotiate credible power, in a multiprofessional setting by working in collaboration with a key clinician on a desired innovation”. They have a role in diffusing innovations and ideas through professionals and organizations. (DOPSON ; FITZGERALD , 2006)", "Since the influence of middle managers and their roles are fundamental to the implementation process, their resistance to it can be a huge obstacle to change . A qualitative st udy based on semi -structured interviews and focus group with 92 middle managers in 17 healthcare units found a greater support from middle managers when innovation meets their needs and priorities, rather than organization as a whole. (CHUANG et al., 2011) The lack of support from top managers and a to p-down behavior may also influence resistance from managers, implying a barrier to innovation. (BROOKS et al., 2011)", "In order to address the role of middle managers in healthcare innovation implementation , Birken et al (2012) presented 4 domains by which the professionals “may bridge the gaps in the information th at employees need to effectively implement healthcare innovations”. Its hierarchical position all ows the perfect assimilation of innovation and its diffusion. They are able to synthesize information and sell the idea to employees, creating an appropriate c limate for the implementation effectiveness.", "Birken et al (2012) applies in their theory many of the elements that were presented in the literature about the role of middle managers, but the approach focused on implementation and the reunion of these 4 constructs representing the bridge bet ween top managers and employee s, shaping the implementation climate was an original contribution. (S. A. BIRKEN et al., 2012)", "Figure 1.3: Middle managers’ role in healthcare innovation implementation. Adapted from (S. A. BIRKEN et al.,", "- Information diffusion consist on dissemination of facts by middle managers in order to give employees relevant information about the innovation imple mentation ; - Information synthesis consist on integration and interpretation of facts by middle managers, to reinforce the importance of implementation to employees and the organization ; - Strategy / Day -to-day activity mediation refers to the identific ation of tasks required for implementation, giving employees the tools necessary to implement them. - Selling innovation implementation means the justification of innovation implementation and encouraging employees to consistently and effectively.", "Previo us studies discussed below have already considered the participation of middle managers as relevant members to the organization's strategy (KANTER, 1982 ; WOOLDRIDGE; FLOYD, 1990; FLOYD; WOOLDRIDGE, 1992; CASTE LLANI , 1992; FLOYD ; WOOLDRIDGE , 1997; ) but their influence on healthcare imp lementation was first assessed by Birken et al . (2012). Authors concluded that “executives may encourage proactivity among middle managers by creating climates in which proactivity is rewarded, sup ported and expected. (S. A. BIRKEN et al., 2013 , p.9).", "Support from top management can increase middle management commitment, by demonstratio n on how innovation is important for organization. (S. A. BIRKEN et al., 2015) . This can be achieved through their involvement in formulating the strategy. (Hovlid & Bukve, 2014) . Through participation in the implementation planning, managers can create their own perceptions of the benefit of innovation (VARSI et al.,", "Urquhart et al. (2014) examined the key interpersonal, organizational, and system level factors that influenced implementation and use of complex innovations in cancer care. Five factors were identified as influential to implementation. Among them, authors have highlighted the role of managers promoting stakeholder’s involvement, management of the changin g process, leading and championing, in addition to administrative and managerial support. Middle managers played an important role, especially in relation to interpersonal aspects of implementation.", "Studies have reported implementation failures related to poor communication between executives and middle managers . This may be due to a lack of training and preparation, in addition to a poor strategic alignment between high and medium level , reflecting a high sense of responsibility for managers. (DAINTY ; SINCLAIR , 2017) Rapid and top -down changes associated with a feeling of lack of autonomy can lead middle managers to lose the potential to act as agents of change. (JAVANPARAST et al., 2018 ; URQUHART et al., 2018 )", "To understand their commitment and motivation is also a way to improve effectiveness of implementation. Another study performed by Urquhart et al. (2019) found that middle managers’ perception of the ease of implementation and the identification of benefit for patients have a positive effect on their work. In addition, they highlighted the importance of education of middle managers about the potential benefit of the innovation and their involvement in the planning phase. (URQUHART et al., 2019)", "Austin et al. (2020) sought to identify the readiness of middle managers to change in a qualitative case study, since these professionals \"must lead the change\" determined by the top man agers. Despite this, they also experience changes and, thus, the identification of factors that impact, positively or negatively, their readiness can be a way to improve their motivation and therefore, the employee's commitment to implementation.", "1.4 O RGANIZATIONAL INNOVATION ON ORGAN DONATION", "Even the leading countries in the donation process have evolved year after year, implementing more efficient systems that reduce losses and failures, and seek to improve safety for all involved, especially recip ients.", "As stated above, despite the excellent performance, failures have been observed in these procurement systems, bringing opportunities for improvement in recent years. In addition, some countries tried to implement some of these models, such as Germa ny, and were unsuccessful, resulting in implementation failures and loss of fin ancial and human resources, such as organs that could not be recovered. (TACKMANN ; DETTMER , 2019)", "Despite all the development of the donation and transplantation area, there are few published studies related to the theme of implementation and sustainabi lity or maintenance over time .", "A systematic review was performed with studies that addressed innovation and donation/transplantation research published between 2006 and 2016. Among the thirty -one selected studies, it was found that most had a clinical ap proach, with a focus on transplantation. Only seven studies had a managerial approach associated to theme of innovation . (SIQUEIRA , 2019)", "Publication s found through bibliographic research for innovation or implementation associated with the field of organ and tissue donation did not reveal any association with the implementation science approach until the beginning of research related to this thesis .", "From analysis of all additional files from a recent systematic review (S. BIRKEN et al., 2018) , that selected one hundred and five studies, in order to assess middle managers’ role in healthcare evidence -based (EBP) practice implementation, there were none that addressed organ and tissue donation field .", "Thus, a theoretical gap was identified and a n opportunity to apply an area of knowledge, which is the science of implementation of organizational implementation of innovations in order to improve stages of the organ and tissue donation process .", "The role of in -hospital coordinators acting as middle managers in the process of organ and tissue donation for transplantation was defined as the subject of study for this thesis .", "1.5 CONTRIBUTIONS, ORIGINALITY AND VALUE", "The organ donation area is essentially public around the world, and the same applies to Brazil. Our country has a public system with broad health care coverage, but it face s serious financial constraints . However , the national system is widely recog nized fo r its values as equity and integrality .(GARCIA et al., 2015)", "The implementation of an in -house transplant coordinators program is one of the most successful st rategies described at national level, but there is a lack of information about the ro le IHC in the implementation phase and their impact on sustainability of the program, which is reflected by its maintenance.

We want to assess whether they could be consider ed important in the implementation and m aintenance of policies and practices within the organization in organ and tissue donation, to improve quantity, quality and effectiveness of donation through training and advisory.

An innovation of this type was implemented at the local level (Rio de Janeiro state), which was the develop of in- house transplant coordinators fully dedicated to organ do nation activities in four public hospitals, through a regional coordination (OPO) and with government support (state health secretary)", "IHC roles in management of organ and tissue donation fit s with Dressler ’s classic classification and positioning at orga nization level : ward chief, clinic director or program coordinator which “develops procedures for implementing institutional policies and is responsible for the operation of a particular servi ce element or elements”. (DRESSLER ,", "The term middle manage ment was associated with in-house transplant coordinators for the first time in the literature, since we assume similarity between the se activities.

Brazil’s organ procurement structure is based on 2 models disseminated worldwide: the “Spanish model,” based on in -house coordinators, and the “American organ procurement organization (OPO) model, ” with extra -hospital coordinators. In 2006, Brazil’s Federal Government had formally introduced the in -house coordination model for every hospital equipped with a mechanical ventilator bed. In January 2012, the Rio de Janeiro State OPO, Programa Estadual de Transplantes , introduced an innovation in the organization of the in -house coordination model in 4 selected public hospitals with high organ donation potential.

(WORLD HEALTH ASSEMBLY , 2010) For many years, countries have adopted different strategies to achieve this goal, but whether a strategy is ethical and acceptable is also an important concern.", "For this reason, worldwide specialists and different members of society gathered in a meetin g at Istanbul from April 30 to May 2, 2008, according to the World Health Organization Guiding Principles on Human Cell, Tis sue, and Organ Trans - plantation (World Health Organization. Guiding principles on human cell, tissue, and organ transplantation , n.d.) , “to address t he urgent and growing problems of organ sales, transplant tourism, and trafficking in organ donors in the context of the global shor tage of organs”. (“The Declaration of Istanbul on Organ Trafficking and Transplant Tourism,”", "Accord ing to these principles established, most countries have focused their attention on increasing organ transplants through obt aining more deceased donors. For this purpose, 2 models became more frequently adopted worldwide: 1) the “Spanish model,” based on i n-house transplant coordinators (IHCs) where the donation staff is located directly within the donor hospitals (MATESANZ , 2003),(MANYALICH et al., 2011),(MATESANZ et al ., 2011) ; and 2) “the American model,” based on organ procurement organizations (OPOs) where the coordinators are located in facilities outside of the hospitals. (NATHAN et al., 2003)", "Whether one model is more efficient than the other is a matter of deep analysis and discussion, owing to different characteristics among cou ntries and regions resulting in wide variation in organ donation rates. (DONATION & TRANSPLANTATION INSTITUTE , 2014)", "In Brazil, a developing country, both models have been accepted since October 2009, when new regulation was approved from the National Transplant System, applying the current National Transplant Law. (Portaria 2600/2009, 2009) At that time, despite the possibility of implementation of any of these models, most State OPOs were presenting low organ donation rates. (ASSOC IAÇÃO BRASILEIRA DE TRANSPLANTE DE ÓRGÃOS, n.d.)", "In 2010, the State of Rio de Janeiro adopted a new organizational model for organ donation, combining strategies and design of both models in a more efficient way through innovation practices after launching the remodeled State OPO, Programa Estadual de Transplantes (PET). (LENZI et al., 2014) Some reports have shown that this practice had a positive imp act on donor detection, through OPO referral and conversion rates when the OPO model was already established. (SALIM et al .,", "The aim of the present study was to analyze the impact of IHCs working as middle managers on referrals, conversion rates, and numb er of donors.", "2.2 METHODS", "As part of an isolated initiative, in January 2012, one of the 160 hospitals in the OPO area, Hospital Estadual Ad ão Pereira N unes (HEAPN) placed 1 nurse as full -time IHC.

No less important, local and cultural characteristics must be understood and analyzed, owing to the peculiarities of each country and region. In fact, innovation is defined as “an idea, practice, or object that is perceived as new by an individual or an other unit of adoption”. (ROGERS EM, 1995 , p.11 ) After 2010, PET imple mented a few innovations in the State of Rio de Janeiro considering variables listed above, including a benchmarking strategy with others states in Brazil and other countries.", "Because education and training are 2 of the most common interventions for obtai ning an efficient organ procurement model (MATESANZ et al., 2011), (LENZI et al., 2014), (MULVANIA et al., 2014) , PET adopted the Transplant Procurement Model (TPM) training for its 1st 4 years, when 200 transplant coor dinators where trained. Because a local experience resulted in an increase in brain -death referrals, conversion rates, and number of organ donors in a single hospital, when in 2012 HEAPN had placed a nurse as fully dedicated procurement staff, and with ev idence already shown that combining both the Spanish and the American models could be successful,(SHAFER et al., 2003 ; SALIM et al., 2007 ), a strategic plan was set to place IHCs in hospitals with high potential for organ donation, where ≥1 physician and 2 nurses, with advanced training (TPM) and full dedication, would be part of the procurement staff.", "Because scientific data suggests that hospitals with more than 150 beds and the presence of a neurosurgical service are correlated w ith the number of potential donors (SHEEHY et al., 2003) , 4 pu blic hospitals were selected with these characteristics with the use of data obtained from Hospital Development at PET.", "Considering the importance and need for rapid change in the scenario of organ donation in the state, the implementation of this innovat ion needed to be efficient. The strategic plan and goals planned by the Secretary of Health and the OPO directors would be implement ed by the IHCs, acting as middle managers and disseminating all over each hospital. Besides, it was also important for the I HC to bring value to all brain - death patient families and hospital employees.", "Observing the impact of an IHC on referrals, conversi on rates, and number of donors, we concluded that this hybrid model should be considered for regions where high - potential h ospitals are located and low performing.", "In addition, we wanted to analyze the implementation period, where these professionals, c lassified as middle managers, would help the diffusion of the information and mediation between strategy and day -to-day acti vities, and selling innovation implementation, as shown by theory. We assumed that this level of management was related to the fast results obtained. (BIRKEN et al., 2012)", "2.5 REFERENCES", "Associa ção Brasileira de Transplante de Órgãos. (n.d.).

The interactions between in -house coordinators and top managers were mandatory for the succe ss of program implementation.", "CONCLUSION", "For the first time in our country, cornea recovery took place f ollowing asystolic death with OPO coordination at a central level. The PTD rate could be estimated, and an analysis of the role of stakeholders could be made for the implementation phase of this innovation in our system.", "3.1 INTRODUCTION", "Cornea transplantation is reported as one of the oldest transplant procedures, with the first surgeries performed in the 1930s. (GARC ÍA-SOUSA et al., 1999) Despite corneal transplantation being the most frequent surgery among all types of transplants, cornea diseases are still the major cause of vision loss, producing psychological and economic consequences for the individual and society as a whole. (WHITCHER et al., 2001)", "In many countrie s the number of corneas procured is insufficient to meet the demand for transplants for several reasons. These include poor id entification and referral of potential tissue donors (PTDs), medical contraindication, and family refusal and logistical issues, w ith the last one representing the main cause of inefficiency. (MURAINE, 2002),(GAIN et al., 2002),(BREDEHORN et al., 2002)", "In Brazil, the number of corneal transplants has been dec reasing since 2012, as has the number of patients on the waiting list. In 2014, 13,000 (68.3 transplants pmp) were performed, whil e the estimated annual demand was more than 17,000 (89 transplants pmp). There is still a disparity in the number of transplan ts between regions in Brazil, varying from 136.6 pmp (Bras ília, Federal District) to 14.7 pmp (state of Rond ônia).(ASSOCIAÇÃO BRASILEIRA DE TRANSPLANTE DE ÓRGÃOS , 2014)", "An improvement in organ donation has taken place in Rio de Janeiro since 2010, with the deceased donor rate increasing from 5.1 pmp in 2010 to 17.0 pmp in 2014. This shift was due to a new organizational model for organ procurement through the launch of a remodeled State Organ P rocurement Organization (OPO) - the Programa Estadual de Transplantes - but the strategy to increase the number of brain -dead donors (DBDs) was unable to meet the demand for corneas and other tissues. (Sarlo et al., 2016),(BONFADINI et al., 2014) . Until 2014, all transplants wer e performed from tissues recovered from DBDs. In the same period, 301 cornea transplants were performed (18.8 pmp), while the estimated demand was more than 1400 surgeries. (ASSOCIAÇÃO BRASILEIRA DE TRANSPLANTE DE ÓRGÃOS , 2014)", "The objective of this study was to analyze the implementation of a system exclusively oriented toward the improvement of cornea recovery and the results of the system following the first 2 yea rs. From the perspective of hea lth care innovation implementation, we will discuss the role of the main participants and their interactions from conception through implementation effectiveness.", "3.1.1 Implementation of a State Cornea Donation System", "In 2014, a strategic plan was mad e to implement a cornea donation system in the state of Rio de Janeiro, with the first goal being to increase cornea recovery and transplantation through donation following asystolic death. The main stakeholders were identifi ed: the OPO, tissue banks, and general hospital staff.", "The objective was to set up an innovation in the local health care system that consisted of telephone referrals from local hospitals to the OPO of all deaths following cardiac arrest. Thus, the OPO s hould coordinate at the central level all tissue donation activities. Every PTD should be identified - that is, any deceased person with no medical contraindication for tissue donation and from whom blood samples could be obtained for serologic tests. (PONT et al., 2003)", "Since it has been demonstrated that the PTD rate varies from 18% to 40% among all hospital deaths, it was hypothesized that this strategy could maximize cornea donation across the state. (PONT et al., 2003), (BARBOZA et al., 2007),(MELLO et al., 2010) In fact, timely referral to an OPO following asystolic death already a standa rd practice in some procurement organizations worldwide, but it had never been done in Brazil with this level of commitment. It has been demonstrated that this practice provides an efficient cornea recovery system. (BREDEHORN et al ., 2002), (CARAMICIU et al .,", "The OPO Cornea Team started operating on January 1, 2015. Ten professionals, including physicians, nurses, and social workers, were admitted to the team to work in 24-hour shifts as OPO transplant coordinators, doing assessment and screening by phone of al l deaths reported by hospitals. When a PTD is identified, the OPO must coordinate the interface between the hospital staff, through its in -house coordinator (IHC), and the tissue bank that will perform the recovery. Two ophthalmologists were responsible fo r training, education, and supervision of nonmedical staf f.", "At the hospital level, one of the main trauma centers in the state, Hospital Estadual Adão Pereira Nunes (HEAPN), was chosen to host the pilot project due to its characteristics and high perfor mance in organ donation in the past years. In this hospital, 4 IHCs were working fully dedicated to organ donation as a result of a health policy implemented a few years before. (SARLO et al., 2016)", "In fact, there was a previously unsuccess ful project for cornea retrieval in progress at the hospital, which had been implemented in January 2013. By that time, the tissue bank had set up a cornea recovery team to work inside the hospital in 24 -hour shifts to detect PTDs and to recover corneas. N o corneas were recovered from cardiac - arrested patients; they were recovered only from brain -dead patients. There was little engag ement of hospital staff in cornea procurement and no relationship between the recovery team and the hospital’s director board beyond a formal consent to the activities.", "Considering the poor performance and the need for improvement, it was assumed that the engagement of the IHCs with a higher level of support from the top managers would be crucial. In April 2015, the tissue bank cornea recovery team was dismissed, and several meetings between the top managers from the OPO, the tissue bank ( Banco de Olhos d o Hospital S ão João Batista ), and the hospital were held to implement the innovation. The initial aim was to sell the innova tion to the hospital’s top management team (TMT) and get their commitment in the assimilation process. It was assumed that this wo uld help to effectively implement the innovation. (PANZANO et al., 2012)", "With TMT support, all IHCs were highly involved and trained for adequate assessment of PTDs, physical examination of tissue samples, and obtaining blood samples after cardiac arrest from a central vein or the heart, if necessary. At the same time, lectures and basic training were held for all hospital staff with the aim of engagement toward cornea donation. A protocol was established for referral of all deaths in real-time to the", "3.2 MATERIAL AND METHODS", "We retrospectively analyzed all deaths betwe en January 1 and December 31, 2016, using the hospital death records and the OPO referrals record. The hospital death records worksheet inputs were name, hospit al ID number, age, time of death, department, and cause of death. The IHC also registered whethe r a family request was made and, if no donation was made, the reason for that. The OPO record had the same inputs, but it was limited to deaths referred from ho spital staff.", "A comparison of hospital death records with OPO referral records was made to ide ntify missed referrals. For estimating the number of PTDs and the potential of the hospital for cornea donation, death causes were grouped into 6 categories: in fectious, neoplasia, cardiovascular disease, trauma, undetermined, and others.", "The strategic p lan and other relevant documents were gathered. The main participants from the IHCs, OPO, and tissue bank were interviewed to clarify their interactions and roles in the project during the implementation phase.", "3.3 RESULTS", "Figure 3.1 summarizes the number of cornea donors from January to December 2016 at HEAPN procured by this protocol. The main steps of innovation implementation described above are also summ arized. Of 1720 deaths in this period, only 1093 (63.5%) were reported to th e OPO for assessment and screening by phone, with subsequent physical examination and family approach by either the IHC or tissue bank staff.", "Graphic 3.1: Number of deaths, r eferrals to the OPO, and cornea donors from January to December 2016 at the hospital (HEAPN). *Corneas procured from brain -death donors are not included in this figure, as this activity is not influenced by the protocol examined in th is report.", "From the 1093 deaths referred to the OPO, 819 were not eligible for donation due to a medical contraindication (74.9%), having been assessed clinically by a transplant coordinator or staff from the tissue bank.

The lack of donor tissue procured is the limiting factor for treating many diseases. Endothelia l abnormalities and keratoconus represent the leading indications for cornea transpl antation. (DAPENA et al., 2009),(DUMAN et al., 2013)", "Apparently, the lack of a tissue donation -oriented system seems to be the main reason for the inefficiency in many countries and regions, due to its peculiarities. In the state of Rio de Janeiro, the OPO launched in 2010 was initially focused on maximizing the number of DBDs, from whom both organs and tissues can be recovered. There was a substantial increase in the number of cornea transplants when 2009 is compared to 2014, with 88 (5.7 pmp) procedures performed in 2009 and 301 (18.8 pmp) in 2014 [6,8]. Th e number of surgeries was still below the necessity, however, as it had alread y been demonstrated that the number of brain -dead patients was insufficient to meet the demand for corneas. Brain death is a rare event, representing only 0.5% to 1% of all death s in a population. (SHEEHY et al., 2003),(HOYERT et al., 2001)", "Studies have demonstrated a considerab le variability in the rate of PTDs (any deceased person with no medical contra indication for tissue donation and from whom blood samples can be obtained for serologic tests) in different regions, varying from 18% to 40% among all deaths, ac - cording to hos pital profiles. (PONT et al., 2003) , (BARBOZA et al ., 2007) , (MELLO et al ., 2010) So, except for medical contraindications, logistical issues represent the main cause for inefficiency in this proces s. These include low or no referral of deaths to the IHCs or the OPO, early removal of the body from the morgue, inability to cool the body in proper temperature, unavailability of the recovering room due to autopsy; unavailability of the recovering team i n time for the procurement, and inability to contact or meet the family of the deceased patient. (GAIN et al., 2002)", "Implementing a cornea donation system oriented toward detection, screening, and adequate timely assessment of PTDs is a challenge, especially in our reality, where the main hospitals are public and most of their staff are unaware of this activity. This is the main reason that we wanted to perform this study, to describe the steps of the implementation and the results and c orrelate them with the literature of health care innovation implementation so that new theoretical constructs can be identified and applied to clinical practice in the future.", "As mentioned before, HEAPN is one of the main trauma centers in the state of R io de Janeiro. Since 2012, the hospital has been developing strategies to improve organ and cornea donation rates. In that facility, there is a highly skilled and fully dedicated IHC team composed of 1 physician and 3 nurses. Despite this, performance with regard to cornea donation following asystolic deaths was negligible. Cost had increased in 2013 when the tissue bank decided to hire profe ssionals, but the results were still unsatisfactory.", "In 2015, the OPO was involved together with hospital top manag ers, and, finally, the IHC work routines were rebuilt, especially with the designation of one of the nurses for cornea donation activities. Then, as shown earlier, the cornea donation rates improved, and cost was reduced at the hospital level. At the OPO l evel, a highly specialized team was settled on in anticipation of a bigger demand in the future, when more hospitals and activities should be integrated to generate more corneas for transplantation.", "It is important to highlight that missed referrals from HEAPN accounted for the loss of detection of more than 400 PTDs, since 36.5% of all deaths were not reported to the OPO. Lack of infrastru cture is still a major cause of the lower conversion rate following PTD identification. Thus, with optimization of re ferral activity and performance improvement, it may be possible to reach up to 300 cornea donors every year.", "As a result of the change in mentality throughout the whole system, the number of transplanted corneas in our region increased from 301 (18.8 pmp ) in 2014 to 575 (34.7 pmp) in 2016. The State Cornea Donation System resulted in an improvement of more than 90% in cornea transplantation following the first 2 years of implementation.", "3.4.1 Analysis from a healthcare innovation implementation pe rspective", "Innovation is defined as “an idea, practice, or object that is perceived as new by an individual or another unit of adoption”. (ROGERS EM, 1995 , p.11) Health care is rich in evidence -based innovations, yet despite a successful implementation in one facility, many cases of innovation may disseminate slowly. (BERWICK , 2003)", "For organ and tissue transplantation, a huge effort has been made worldwide toward the dissemination of best practices through benchmarking and innovation implementation. (WORLD HEALTH ASSEMBLY , 2010) In spite of this effort, there is still a huge difference among countries, with multiple factors influencing donation and transplantation activities, such a s economics, politics, and sociocultural behavior, which are also affecting other innovations in he alth care. (DONATION & TRANSPLANTATION INSTITUTE , 2014),(DENIS et al., 2002)", "This study aimed to analyze the implementation period, which is “th e transition period [during] which targeted organizational members ideally become increasingly skillful, consistent, and committed in their use of an innovation”. (KLEIN ; SORRA , 1996) Considering that the proposed innovation (the implementation of a protocol for interaction between the hospital [HEAP N] and the OPO [ Programa Estadual de Transplantes ]), came from an outsider organiz ation, the assimilation process was assumed to be a crucial step. Assimilation is defined as an organizational process that 1. begins when organizational decision -makers firs t become aware of an evidence - based health care innovation (EBHI), 2. can lead to the adoption of the EBHI, and 3. may culminate in the EBHI’s routinization or institutionalization by adopter organizations. (YIN, 1977)", "Studies ha ve been published to identify particular factors that may influence the implementa tion phase and stakeholder involvement, management of the change process, championship behavior, and administrative and managerial support, and the most relevant innovation a ttributes recently have been described. (URQUHART et al., 2014) A qualitative analysis would be an elucidating tool for identification of these factors in our pro ject.", "After involvement of the TMT and their assimilation with subsequent support behavior, the death referral protocol has been started. The interaction b etween hospitals’ TMTs and the local IHC teams acting as middle managers in this scenario possibly influenced positively the implementation process. TMTs may increase middle managers’ commitment in many ways, such as by directly conveying to them that inno vation implementation is an organizational priority, allocating implementation policies and practic es, and even encouraging middle managers to leverage performance reviews and human resources to achieve innovation implementation. (BIRKEN et al., 2015)", "In fact, the role of the IHCs as middle managers in this innovat ion should be better understood, since these professionals, as nurses, social workers, and intensiv e care unit doctors, have a strategic location between the TMT and frontline employees. Since the IHCs are the specialized donation professionals, their role in implementation with sensibilization and diffusion of the innovation may be considered as fundam ental. (BIRKEN et al., 2012)", "From what we know, our study is the first to document the implementation of a regional system exclusively oriented toward cornea recovery in Brazil, reporting a complex interaction between managers. The approach and analysis from the innovation implementation point of view is also original and can bring ideas to other projects within the organ and tissue donation field, but also for the health care system as a whole.", "3.5 CONCLUSION", "From our analysis of the data obtained from hospital and OPO administrative registers and comparison of these data with previo us articles published, it is clear that a better result could be obtained. First of all, only 63.5% of all deaths were referred to the OPO, which limited the number of PTDs available for screening and assessment. In addition, logistical problems such as la ck of infrastructure at the hospital or lack of a specialized professional also played an important role in the final results.", "This study contributed to the estimation of PTDs in our population, since no data were available until now in the Rio de Janeir o State OPO area. At HEAPN, there may have been up to 693 PTDs (that would be eligible in theory for donation), and with a perform ance improvement, it may be possible to reach up to 300 cornea donors every year.", "An integrated system with specific policie s and practices for cornea donation is critical to achieving satisfactory results. In Rio de Janeiro, the engagement of all stakeh olders was possible due to a solid strategic plan from top managers and an efficient execution from middle managers.", "Further studies will be needed to measure the implementation effectiveness and improve the number of cornea and tissue donors, but this s tudy can bring an optimistic vision for the health care and transplant system in our region.", "3.6 REFERENCES", "Associação Brasileira de Transplante de Órgãos.

(2012) as crucial to the success of the implementation, since these professionals have the ability t o establish an effective connection between the strategy designed by top managers and the execution performed by employees. Its hierarchical position allows the perfect assimilation of innovation and its diffusion.

Diffusion and synthesizing information were rated as the most important activities, while selling innovation implementation as the least important. The study brings an important contribut ion regarding the differentiation between middle managers and champio n: “whereas champions may give frontline employees the motivation to implement an innovation, middle managers may give frontline employees the means to do so with practical information, t ools, and assistance.” (S.

Authors also found that they have are additional responsibilities within the organization and “have limited decision -making power with respec t to implementation”. So, their role during implementation must b e aligned with the determinations of the top managers.

As a result, the number of donors is thrice, and the number of transplants is twice between central and north regions.

(ASSOCIAÇÃO BRASILEIRA DE TRANSPLANTE DE ÓRGÃOS , 2016)", "The adoption of cost -effective public policies is a fund amental measure for any healthcare system, especially in developing countries, which are more susceptible to crisis. For some pathologies, such as liver failure, transplantation may be the only definitive therapeutic option. In other cases, such as kidney failure, transplantation generally offers the best quality of life at a lower cost, especially in relation to dialysis.

It is possible to see that these units have acquired greater relevan ce in the OPO area, which covers 230 hospitals. The hospitals that hosted the project were responsible for 47% of all actual deceased donors in 2015 and despite the crisis, they maintained an excellent performance in the following years.", "Among all the oth er hospitals in the OPO area, at least 12 other hospitals were identified as units with a high potential for obtaining ADDs. For the control group, 4 main hospitals were selected, which in addition to having characteristics and infrastructure similar to th e intervention group, had the best performance in donation rates in 2011.", "The comparison between the control and intervention groups shows in the bootstrap analysis that the adoption and implementation of innovation had a positive impact in all years of t he study, as show in graphic 4.1. While in the intervention group there were 711 actual deceased donors during the study period, in the control group there were only 232 actual deceased donors, in the same period.", "If the performance in this group were th e same as in the intervention group, following the implementation of IHC through 2012 to 2018, it would be possible to obtain up to 572 ADDs in this group, which would lead to an additional 340 donors. Such a performance would add between 700 to 800 solid organ transplants in the same period, consideri ng the State of Rio de Janeiro Organ Transplanted per Donor (OTPD) yield.

Managers duties included: to provide early referrals and evaluation of potential donors, a coordinated and planned family approach, specialized donor management, education and training initiatives, administrative and quality support. P ositive results were attributed to th ese strategies, but there was no mention of the relationship between IHC and senior management, as directors. Major financial limitations were also cited, which we assume have imp acted the project's continuity.", "At the national level, the results reported by Andrade and Figueiredo (2019) over a 13 - year period in Santa Catarina are one of the most long -standing success stories in our country. A very well coordinated plan coordinated by the OPO, consisting of a strategy based on education and training lead t o an increase of 172.5% in ADD was reported during the study period.

BMC Research Notes ,", "5 CONCLUSIONS", "Organ and tissue donation is a very challenging field, where for developed countries it has been applying complex strategies in order to improve their performance seque ntially . For developing countries this challenge is harder , as they need to deal with multiple difficulties , in addi tion to financial constrain ts.(RUDG E et al., 2012)", "Regardless of social, political and economic issues, each country and region face particular problem s and needs to adopt different strategies, sometimes adapted from some existing model or if necessary , to implement original measures. (DOMÍNGUEZ - GIL; MURPHY; PROCACCIO , 2016 ; BECKER et al., 2020 )", "In the State of Rio de Janeiro, a se ries of managerial measures into organ and tissue donation process culminated in improvements in the local transplant ation system . It has led to the development of local research in order to understand these phenomena and seek to improve performance , aim ing at increasing the quantity and quality of organs and tissues procured and thus, the number of local transplants performed. (LENZI et al., 2014; BONFADINI et al., 2014)", "At the local level, hiring professionals fully dedicated to donation activities represented an organizational innovation for the State health care system. The adoption of the Spanish model in four public hospitals aimed to increase rates, in units with high potential for organ donation . As in -house transplant coordinators (IHC), the managers are supposed to “increase the quantity , quality, and effectiveness of organ and tissue donation by training and advising healthcare professionals in the major steps of the donation process” (MANYALICH et al., 2011) .", "IHC are allocated in the middle of organization and need to “be skilled in personal and professional relationships to be locally accepted and ack nowledged, supported by hospital managers, and paid for their work.” (MANYALICH et al., 2011)", "Middle managers are subordinated to top managers, usually hospital directors, and need to be in constant contact with all healthcare professionals in their unit s. (NEALEY ; FIEDLER , 1968) and have been considered important in the implementation and maintenance of policies and practices within the organization. (DRESSLER, 1978)", "Middle managers are important for im plementing changes and improving the organization's performance. (FLOYD ; WOOLDRIDGE , 1997) . There is a growing scientific interest in research that ass ess the role of middle managers in healthcare innovation implementation .(CHUANG ; JASON ; MORGAN , 2011) . Despite this, there is still “little understanding regarding middle managers’ role in EBP implementation”. (S. BIRKEN et al., 2018)", "The similarity of managerial functions between IHC and middle managers role was assumed for this dissertation. Birken et al. (2018) performed a systematic review to identify studies reporting on middle managers’ roles in he althcare EBP implementation and i ts determinants. Among one hundred five records selected, from 1996 to 2015, there was none that addressed organ and tissue donation field. (S. BIRKEN et al.,", "The objective of th is thesis is to investigate an association between in -house transplant coordinators activities and their role as middle managers, seeking to describe the process of the implementation of practices towards organ and tissue d onation improvement in four hospi tals in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.", "Within the seven -year period of IHC activities as managers fully dedicated to the organ and tissue donation process, we sought to investigate whether the implementation of this innovation was effective; the strategic acti ons with IHC intermediation between directors, executives and employees ; and the possible association between the activities developed to improve the donation process with middle managers ’ role addressing the innovation imp lementation literature.", "The first article of this thesis d ocuments the period of implementation of the S panish model of in four public hospitals and the defined criteria for this choice, analyzing the impact of activities developed from these professiona ls on organ donation : Impact of the introduc ing Full-time i n-house coordinators on refer ral and organ don ation rates in Rio de Janeiro Public Hospitals : a Health Care Innovation Practice", "The paper describes the strategic plan, the criteria for selecting h ospitals and the composition of donation teams. From 2011 to 2014, the IHC provided (in the four hospitals) an improvement of the main performance indicators of organ donation, since there was an increase of 132% in brain death referrals, an improvement of donor conversion rates from 20 to 42% an d finally, an increase in the number of donors from 26 to 128 donors, fulfilling Manyalich et al. (2011) propositions.", "From this publication, the innovation in the local transplant system was documented, featuring an effective implementation process. (KLEIN; SORRA, 1996) . Despite the associatio n between IHC with middle managers’ roles it was not possible to address it from a theoretical perspective.", "The second article of this dissertation, entitled Project of Cornea Donation in Rio de Janeiro: Analysis of the Implementation of an Organization Innovation Practice , provides the description of a tissue donation team in order to improve cornea donation, under Organ Procurement Organization (OPO) coordination, through intermediation of the IHC, in one of the previously selected hospitals.", "To set up an efficient tissue procurement system, all stakeholders should be involve d within the strategic plan . (MURAINE , 2002 ; CARAMICIU et al., 2014 ; BONFADINI et al., 2014 ). In tissue donor sc reening, all deaths must be evaluated and there are several additional logistical problems for tissue harvesting, in addition to more rigorous criteria for donor validation. (PONT et al., 2003)", "This paper describes the development of the tissue donation system , where the coordination and strategic design were developed by the top managers (the OPO and hospitals’ directors) and IHC mediat ed the strategy with in healthcare professionals. Results obtai ned were reported , which were possible through adherence and commitment . Following the first year of this project, 116 corneas were procured, which represented an increase of 163% over the previous year.", "Scholars have highlighted the influence of middle m anagers with employees in the change process through strategy, where their involvement can improve the organization's performance, especially if they are involved in decision -making processes .(FLOYD ; WOOLDRIDGE , 1997 ; BREWER; LOK , 1995 )", "The strategic alignment betwee n top managers and middle managers can be part of public policies and organ donation in Brazil is properly applied to this scope .(CLIFFORD , 2001)", "Middle managers may strongly influence organization’s performance, especially if they are empowered, facilitating the diffusion of innovation . (DOPSON ; FITZGERALD , 2006) . The results obtained in such a complex process seem s to reflect this element.", "Support from top managers has been described as a way to increase middle management commitment . The knowledge and involvement of these professionals in strategic planning has been attributed to positive imple mentation outcomes. (URQUHART et al. 2014 ; S. A. BIRKEN et al., 2015; HOVLID; BUKVE, 2014; VARSI et al., 2015 ) The results achieved in this series were attributed to executives support in association with IHC commitment with implementation.", "The last article of this dissertation entitled: The role of in -house transplant coordinators as middle managers in organ don ation rates in Rio de Janeiro: from implementation to sustainability , provides a deeper overview of the activities and strategies carried out by the IHC, in order to have a broader and more detailed approach to the implementation process through their role s as middle managers.", "Two statistical methods were carried out for a quantitat ive analysis: bootstrap analysis and T-test (Students' test), using a retrospective control group in which the innovation was not implemented , in order to verify whether the pre sence of the IHC has a significant impact on results, from 2011 to 2018. The ye ar of 2011 precedes the implementation of the innovation.", "The control group consisted in four hospitals with total number of beds, ICU beds, in addition do an emergency room an d neurosurgery service , that is, high potential for organ procurement.", "The re sults found through the two statistical tests: T test and Bootstrap analysis, confirm that the implementation was effective and the presence of the IHC was statistically significant.", "Graphic 4.1.", "Scatter plot analysis: comparison between the intervent ion group (inhouse coordinators: HEGV, HEAPN, HEAT and HEAS) and the control group (without inhouse coordinators)", "Without IHCScatter plot -Comparison Intervention (IHC) x Control", "Graphic 4.2 Comparison of intervention group (with IHC) with control group (without IHC) with T -Test (Students’ test)", "Semi -structured in terviews with eight IHC were performed for a qualitative analysis, in order to assess their role as middle managers in the implementation period , addressing the four domains described by Birken et al. (2012): information diffusion, synthesizing information , mediating between strategy and day -to-day activities and selling innovation implementation .", "Through the qualitative analysis it was possible to identify several activities carried out by the IHC over the years and to relate these activities to the doma ins investigated . A relationship was identified between the activities of these managers and the maintenance or sustainability of the do nation teams", "This dissertation aims to provide a theoretical contribution, through the application of theories from inn ovation implementation with organ and tissue donation field, positioning the IHC as middle managers, addressing their role in middle man agement and proposing a domain of influence on sustainability or maintenance of innovation, at least in organ and transp lantation field.", "The quantitative and qualitative results presented can provides a practical contribution to management strategies towa rds organ and tissue donation improvement, with several actions carried out by IHC.", "This study has some limitations, s uch as being restricted to a single region , which was the State of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Financial crisis in the country has negativel y impacted donation rates from 2015 to 2018, but an attempt was made to neutralize this effect by comparing it to a cont rol group with similar characteristics.", "A limitation, which can be considered for a future research is a qualitative approach of all stakeholders involved is the donation process: OPO directors, hospital directors, employees, families, transplanted recip ients and transplant teams", "The study of transplant coordinat ors with an approach focused on middle management can open up a wide range of possibilities, allowing theoretical contributions for innovation implementation, but it can also bring management pra ctices strategies and insights to improve the donation and transplantation process , allowing more lives to be saved."]}

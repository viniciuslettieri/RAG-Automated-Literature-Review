Evaluation of scale and seasonality for biorefineries project with different technology maturity level: case studies for sugarcane and marine biorefineries . Rio de Janeiro, 2022. Thesis (D.Sc. in Chemical and Biochemical Technology Processes) – School of Chemistry , Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, 20 22 The appropriate tec hno-economic assessment of biorefineries is essential for consolidating a bio -based economy. The effects of scale , seasonality, and product portfolio selection on the design of biorefineries must be assessed. This thesis presents two remarkable case studi es developed for two of the most competitive countries able to host the new low carbon industry. In the first case study , a sugarcane biorefinery w as assessed using an extensive process simulation and economic modeling methodology. Four sub - processes were simulated for eight different scales: ethanol from sugarcane, ethanol dehydration to ethylene, ethylene to mono ethylene glycol (MEG), and electricit y and steam generation from bagasse. Models for capital expenditure and minimum selling price versus product capacity were developed for ethanol, bio -ethylene, and MEG. The integrated biorefinery was analyzed for 200 kt onne /yr and 440 kt onne /yr bio -ethylen e capacities, considering three regions of Brazil: Northeast, South -central, and São Paulo/Paraná. Seasonality effects were mitigated by establishing a storage park alongside the biorefinery. The results indicated that the selling price of bio -MEG must be at least 20 - 30% higher than the fossil -based MEG to ensure competition. The 440 kt onne /yr biorefinery located in the South -central region had the lowest bio -MEG selling price ; however, it required an outsized distillery. Moreover, scale and seasonality had a significant impact on the competitiveness of the biorefinery. The bio -MEG selling price might vary by up to 22%, depending on the specific combination of these factors. Using the same methodology, the second case study assesses scale effects and product portfolio selection in designing a biorefinery from Sargassum muticum seaweed. Two process conversion units were simulated: one considering anaerobic digestion steps for producing biogas and generating electricity (base project), and the other with residu al seaweed solids sold as fertilizer (alternative project). A comprehensive economic analysis was performed to estimate the minimum selling price of the process’s main product (fucoidan extract). Results indicated that capital expenditures are up to 12.7% times higher in the base project. Minimum selling prices of the fucoidan extract product demonstrate the biorefinery’s economies of scale for both projects. Seaweed’s low methane potential reduces the economic attractiveness of electricity generation from biogas in the base project. Conversely, organic fertilizer price was more influential in the alternative project. Nonetheless, risk analyses show similar results for both scenarios, mainly due to fucoidan extract selling price and CAPEX estimates uncertain ties.", "viii Lista de Figuras Figure 1: Example – Block flow diagram for polymer -grade ethylene production. ..... 38 Figure 22.

This thesis adopted the Biorefiner y definition as multi -process facilities characterized by the sustainable conversion of biomass into value -added products and are the basis of a sustainable bio -based economy (JONG et al. , 2020) . Biorefineries with carbon capture and storage can be further developed into carbon dioxide (CO 2) removal facilities (negative emissi ons) (MILÃO et al., 2019) . Furthermore, bio -based chemicals can play a key role in green recovery after the COVID -19 crisis (FRITSCHE et al. , 2020) , with a potential to generate over 10 billion USD revenue for the chemical industry worldwide (LÖFFLER et al. , 2010) . Biorefinery development h as two strategic goals: the displacement of imported petroleum in favor of renewable domestic raw materials (an energy goal) and the establishment of a robust biobased industry (an economic goal) (BOZELL; PETERSEN, 2010) .", "Biomass can be defined as a combination of organic substances derived directly or indirectly from photosynthesis. Generally, biomass originates from plants such as shrubs, trees, algae, crops, and non -petrochemical organic materials (TURSI, 2019) . Biomass conversion is an essential process that ensures the economic, environmental, and social feasibility of biorefineries (SUKUMARA; FAULKNER; SEAY, 2013) . However, the establishment of biorefineries is limited, due to low oil prices, economies of scale, high raw material costs, and a lack of relevant policies (JONG et al. , 2020) . The techno -economic feasibility of biochemicals must be proven or pro moted by policies to improve the economic efficiency of biorefineries. Another key factor for the success of the bio -based economy is the development of biorefinery systems that can be well integrated into the existing infrastructure . Brazilian sugarcane i ndustry is a well succeed example of biorefineries, thus this thesis will evaluate the use of Brazilian ethanol infrastructure for biochemicals production . Understanding the bioproduct economies of scale is crucial for the feasibility of a biorefinery. The different economies of scale for fossil -based plant capacities versus bio -based plant capacities are a reason for the limited increase in biochemical produ ction (JONG et al. , 2020) . Addressing scale issues is, therefore, one of the main contributions from this study. The sustainable feasibility of each sub -system of a biorefinery is highly related to its installation location. Sukumara et al. (2014) revealed the r elevance of location, as the cost of diesel was reportedly the most sensitive parameter because of the numerous trucks required to transport raw materials and products. Peréz et al. (2017) confirmed the majority of the scientific studies related to biorefi neries were conducted in the USA and emphasized the importance of increasing the number of case studies conducted worldwide.", "The objective of this thesis is to evaluate scale and seasonality impacts in biorefineries systems through two case studies . Brazil and United States were chosen to host the biorefineries proposed and tested owing to their comparative s advantages associated with raw material avai labiity and existing infrastructure . The first case study proposes and evaluate s a biorefinery system composed by f our sub -processes that were simulated for eight different scales: ethanol from sugarcane, ethanol dehydration to ethylene, ethylene to mono ethylene glycol (MEG), and electricity and steam generation from bagasse . In the second case study a marine biorefinery system based on a bench scale process is proposed and virtualy scaled -up and evaluated for six scales.", "In the Equatorial zone, sugarcane is one of the most harvested crops (CORAL MEDINA et a l., 2021) . Sugarcane -based biorefineries can produce biofuels (ethanol), chemicals, electricity, and heat. The transportation sector has a major impact on climate change, and biofuels can be a sustainable energy carrier that makes this sector less carbo n intensive (PANAHI et a l., 2019) . Furthermore, sugarcane can be converted into natural polymers, organic matter, and other high value bioproducts, thereby replacing petrochemicals (VAZ, 2019) . However, t he impact of seasonality when establishing a biorefinery using ethanol as feedstock and sugarcane bagasse as a fuel for heat and power production can be re levant. Ther efore, it has been evaluated as the first case study analyzed in this thesis . The p roduction of mono ethylene glycol (MEG) and electricity from sugarcane were assessed in different regions of Brazil , according to the individual analysis of the economies of scale for each unit in the biorefinery and the impact of the facility location on capital expenditure (CAPEX) and minimum selling price (MSP).", "The first case study originally contributes to scientific literature by measuring the scale effect in three different processes (first generation ethanol, ethanol dehydration to ethylene and ethylene glycol) individually and associated into a biorefinery system. As it was already noticed scale is an important issue especially when the f inal product competes with fossil -based options . Despite scale is usually cited as an important source of uncertainty it was not the main analyzed variable for all the studies reported by the United States the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL ) for example (HUMBIRD et al., 2011a; LYND et al., 2005a, 2005b) . Moreover, even in the studies where scale effect was conside red it was done in a simpler way by adopting general scale factors (GERAILI; ROMAGNOLI, 2015; JONG et al., 2017) . Likewise, studies focusing on sugarcane based biorefineries didn´t deeply addressed the scale effects in the final product sell ing price (MONCADA; EL -HALWAGI; CARDONA, 2013; PEREIRA et al., 2015) . Albeit the bio -mono ethylene glycol is receiving growing attention specially in China (YANG et al., 2019; ZHAO et al., 2021a) no public study evatuated a technology mature route using sugarcane what represents another original contribution of this thesis. Even though , many studies propose the co -production of biofuels and biochemicals from sugarcane , raw material seasonality is less discussed than scale. Therefore , the strategy adopted in this thesis first case study to deal with sugarcane seasonality is using ethanol as a chemical plataform that modulat e the operational factor difference between the sugarcane mill and the bio -chemical facilities , what represents one more contribution made by th e present thesis.", "The second case study deals with less mature value chains using ocean raw materials. The use of marine resources such as fisheries and traditional aquaculture for food applications is a well -established sector worldwide. Other Marine resources have also been used for centuries in medicine and agriculture (CHOJNACKA, el al. , 2015) . However, there is a growing interest in adding value to marine biomasses, by developing new non -food uses, besides novel food and feed. The so -called “blue economy ” incorporates economic activities that generate these products from renewable aquatic biological resources (BIBER et al. , 2022) . Participants of the Blue Bioeconomy Forum in 2018 foresaw the global blue bioeconomy market growing to about €10 billion in 2030, contributing to sectors such as pharmaceuticals, agricultural, energy, and other indu stries (EUROPEAN COMMISSION, 2019) .", "As the second case study assessed by this thesis a S. muticum bioreferiney was designed to produce fucoidan (heteropolymers containing substantial percentages of L-fucose and sulfate ester groups, but also galactose and trace xylose) (ÁLVAREZ - VIÑAS et al., 2019; KURNIALAHI et al., 2020) , which can be used in pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, and nutraceuticals (RESEARCH, 2021; SEN, 2020) . A second product (electricity or fertilizer) was also tested to increase the fucoidan competitiveness. Albeit fucoidan production have been previously evaluated (ZHANG; THOMSEN, 2021) it was done for ot her algae species ( Laminaria digitata, Fucus vesiculosus, and Saccharina latissimi ) what represents the economic evaluation carried out in this thesis one more original contribution for scient ific literature . The process evaluated in this case study is onl y based on lab scale procedures (FLÓREZ -FERNÁNDEZ et al., 2021) in opposition to the mature processes assessed in the first case (sugarcane biorfinery). Thus , the second case study devolped in this thesis assess the potential value of a laboratory scale experiment for industrial applications what represents an original contribution also for the marine based biorefineries in general (A. GOLBERG et al. , 2020) and for S. muticum particularly (MILLEDGE; NIELSEN; BAILEY, 2015) beyond contributing with a new biorefinery potential system analysis.", "1.1 Thesis structure and specific objectives", "This thesis is structured in six chapters, with this introdution as the first one of them. Chapter 2 presents the scientific literature regarding the definition of biorefineries and its importance for the new bioeconomy , the different sources of raw materials , including those coming from the ocean , and the way techno -economic studies of biorefineries were implemented , as a tool to support biorefineries developmen t. These studies were extensively assessed i n order to better characterize the main contribution of this thesis. Chapter 3 brings the methodology description developed to help process evaluation since the early mature stages to the commercial phase deploym ent.", "Chapter 4 presents the application of the developed methodology for the first case , which refers to the production of ethylene glycol from sugarcane. Integrating biorefineries processes into existing infrastructure was tested for the Brazilian sugarcane industry and effects of scale and seasonality w ere measured. Therefore, this case study refers to a consolidated process for production a chemical commodity from an already established industry.", "In turn, in Chapter 5 the developed metho dology was applied to a lab scale process that was scaled up . The feasibility of fucoidan production was evaluated considering the scale and co -products effects , in order to show the validity of the me thod for a not yet mature process that output a fine ch emical.", "Finally, Chapter 6 presents the conclusions of the thesis , high lighting the comparison between the two applications of the methodology as a way to prove its validation . Limitations of the stud y and recommendations for future research are also provided .", "Chapter 2 - Literature review A sustainable industry based on renewable raw material could compose the response to the conventional fossil -based industry, associated to environmental problems such as the GH G effects (DAIOGLOU et al., 2019; LAP, 2018) . In addition, it can be part of a green recovery after COVID -19 crisis. Bior efineries are also a key element in the modern bio economy (KARAN et al., 2019) and the production of bio -based chemicals could generate over 10 billion USD of revenue for the global che mical industry (JONG et al., 2011) . Reinforcing the concept of biorefinery as multi -process facilities characterized by the sustainable conversion of biomass into value -added products . Reduce energy dependence, enhance national security, and strengthen the macroe conomic condition of rural communities are also targets that biorefin eries could contribut e (HUMBIRD et al., 2011b) . Nevertheless, the emergence of a new industry or even the replacement of a raw material by an industry (BENNETT; PEARSON, 2009) is a complex process that go beyond technical and economics shift, inducing modifications in the structure of society (GEELS, 2004) . Although the conversion process is not the only significant matter in all value chain , it is a central element that must be feasible and meet the economic, environmental, and social requirements. The more technical and costs information available in the literature for new and existing technologies better results will be provided by more in tegrated approach that aims to support policymakers and stakeholders to identify opportunities.", "The history of using processes simulation tools to design and evaluate biorefineries started o n the end of 1990´s decade when the U.S Department of Energy (DOE) was promoting the development of ethanol from lignocellulosic feedstocks as an alternative to conventional petroleum transportation fuels and studies using AspenPlus® as the main tool to perfom energy and mass balances aiming t o support process design and generate absolute costs of the production of bioproducts based on process and plant design assumptions started to be published . Wooley et al. (1999) , from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) , did the process design and economic model for the biomass -to-ethanol process based on co -current dilute acid prehydrolysis, along with simultaneous saccharification (enzymatic) and co -fermentation (WOOLEY et al., 1999) . Those technologies were being developed by NREL and the process design was also useful to support the experimental activities . Their results were reasonable and consistent with good engineering practice for plant s of this type using available technical data , they contract ed an industry -knowledgeable turnkey company (Delta -T Coporation) to assist in preparing, reviewing, and estimanting costs for the process design. Also, when they made changes in process capacity, they used the scaling power law expression (Equation 15) with an exponent of 0.7 rather than re -cost the equipments for the new size . Despite this simplification the study identified whose were the critical equipments and Aden et. al (2002) revised the process and economic model incorporating the experimental improvements and engaging Harris Group to perform vendor testing, process desig n, and costing those critical equipments identified (this included solid/liquid separation and pretreatmen reactor) . The process design and economic model demonstrated to be useful for predicting the cost benefits of the proposed research and how the resul ts can be translated into modifications of the process design (ADEN et al., 2002) .", "In the earlies 2000 NREL proposed the biorefinery concept based on oil refineries and corn wet milling examples (LYND et al., 2005a, 2005b) . On this opportunity they discussed that i n the investment planning stage, the product mix decisions are affected by many factors and economy of scale is a significant one. Doubling the plant capacity generally increases investment required by only 50 percent , so costs per unit of production dec rease with plant size. In a simplistic sense, one operator can run a process whether the unit produces few thousand tonnes per year , or seve ral thousand tonnes , thus unit labor costs decrease as production capacity incr eases. Transporting agricultural raw materials represent s significant cost compared to the value of the material and must be considered in the economy of scale. Thus, feedstock availability is a limiting factor in determining the maximum size of a biorefin ery affecting its economy of scale (LYND et al., 2005a) . While the biggest refine ry in US process more than 600 ,000 barrels of oil per day one single ethanol distillery can not surplus 25,000 barrels per day of maximum production capacity ( U.S. Energy Information Administration – accessed April 2022). Besides discuss economy of scale, Lynd et. al (2005a) also put attention in the market seasonality that is observed both in oil refineries and corn wet milling. Nevertheless, no issue was rised regarding raw material seasonality.", "Lynd et. al (200 5b) proposed the biorefinery concept through a biomass refinery unit producing ethanol as a primary product, cogenerated power, and comprising the strategy to couple a high value low volume product in th e product portfolio they have tested succinic acid, latic acid and biobutanol as coproducts . The process technology still based co-current dilute acid prehydrolysis, along with simultaneous saccharification (enzymatic) and co -fermentation (WOOLEY et al., 1999) . Two process designs were evaluated: the near -term scenario 262,328 m³ of ethanol from corn stover ; and the long -term on e with 1,074 ,300 m³ of ethanol from poplar culture. When all the coproducts are produced in association with etha nol and power the ethanol selling price was reduced 27% for the near -term case and 58% for the long -term one. The impact of scale was evaluated using an exponent fact or of 0.7 for all processes and no discussion have been made regarding seasonality. This approach indicated the economies of scale could be achieved for scales lower than 2,200 t/day. However, although this scale -up simplification can be done for this type of analysis the present thesis propose s a more detailed analysis for scales impact in the case studies evaluated besides to measure seasonality effects in the minimum selling price what for the sugarcane based biorefineries can be significative .", "Over a d ecade the NREL biochemical ethanol process was experimental optimized through its continuously techno -economic modeling. Humbird et al. (2011) presesented the “State of technology ” for the corn stover to ethanol process by dilute - acid pretreatment, enz ymatic saccharification, and co -fermentation as well as anciliary areas such as: feed handling, product recovery, wastewater treatment, lignin combustion, and utilities. Process updates were made in the conversion areas (pre - treatment, con ditioning, saccharification and fermentation), optimizations in product recovery, and an improved understanding of the ethanol plant´s back end (wastewater and utilities). The minimum ethanol selling price (MESP) still being a key analysis variable that a llowed policymakers and DOE to assess the cost -competitiveness and market penetration potential of cellulosic ethanol in comparison with petroleum -derived fuels and starch - or sugar -based ethanol (HUMBIRD et al., 2011b) . Harris Group as well as in 2002 helped with equipment costing, however authors have not repeated the scale sensitivity analysis considering the trends observed in previous report st illed valid. Again, no d iscussion regarding raw material seasonality have been done and they found a minimum selling price of 0.57 USD per liter (2. 15 USD per gallon) . In 2013, NREL began transitioning from the singular focus on ethanol to a broad slate of products and conversio n pathways (DAVIS et al., 2018) . Jones et al . (2013) described a thermochemical process for converting biomass into liquid transportation fuels via fast pyrolysis followed by hydroprocessing of the conden sed pyrolysis oil (JONES et al., 2013) . The technology was not commercially available when the studies was carried out , thus the process flow diagrams, and simulation models were based on research results from completed and ongoin g research projects at the laboratories consortium (beyond NREL were part the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory and Idaho National Laboratory) and other research organizations . Equipment costs were provided by commercial vendors for mature and similar technologies. Then, with the heat and material balances from simulations models and capital and operating costs, the a uthors have perfomed a discounted cash flow analysis obtaining the minimum selling price for gasoline and diesel, which were the biorefine ry main product. The processing capacity was 2,000 metric ton nes per day of dry biomass resulting in a fuel production yield of 40 gallons of gasoline per dry U.S. ton ne of biomass and 44 gallons of diesel per dry U.S. dry ton nee of biomass. Natural gas is used to generate a portion of the hydrogen needed for hydrotreating and electricity is purchased from the grid. The minimum combined gasoline and diesel blendstock fuel selling price is $3.39 per gasoline gallon equivalent (lower heating value basis) in 2011 dollars. Scale was not matter of sensitivity analysis on this study.", "Along the last decade the DOE is pursuing the “State of Technology” that will allow the minimum selling price of less than 2.5 USD per gallon of gasoline equivalent. After", "2016 the modeling and experimental work were focused on four representative", "bioconversion pathway options for conversion of sugars to fuel precursors, namely oleaginous yeast lipid s (aerobic), fatty alcohols (aerobic), carboxylic acids (anaerobic), and 2,3 -butanediol (BDO) (anaerobic/minimal oxygen required for cell redox balancing) (DAVIS et al., 2018) . Those pathways were evaluated and compared against selling price goal of 3 USD per gallon of gasoline equivalent and one remarkable finding was the importance of lignin coproducts and the need of substantial assistance to this purpose. The 2018 “State of Technology” report focused on the anaerobic pathways due its smaller distance to selling price goals , adipic acid was produced alongside hydrocarbons fuels. The plant size was the same used in the prior NREL designs (2,200 US tons/day) and based on initial and simplified analyses around feedstock/biorefinery scale . It was found that moving to smaller scales (which reduces feedstock transportation costs) continues to be outweighed by biorefinery economy -of- scale penalties what have been consistent with prior scale evaluation indications (DAVIS et al., 2018) . Those findouts highlight the scale importance in biorefineries projects and reinforc e this thesis objective of carry out a deep scale evaluation for biorefineries systems.", "The NREL´s State o f Technology benchmark model have been assessed annually (DAVIS; BARTLING; TAO, 2020, 2021) and for the 2021 State of Technology latest experimental developments were incorporated to the techno -economic models to measure its impacts in minimum selling prices (DAVIS; BARTLING, 2022) . Two separate biological conversion pathways to fuels : carboxylic acids (primarily butyric acid) and diols (2,3 -butanediol [BDO]) . Each pathway was evaluated for two scenarios regarding lignin utilization: combustion and conversion to value -added coproducts. On this update lignin was processed to the production of ß -ketoadipate (BKA) , in place of muconic /adipic acid, what was translated to a roughly 17% increase in mass yield o f final coproduct output relative to prior 2020 State of Technology benchmarks (DAVIS; BARTLING, 2022) . Despite that, the lignin -to-coproduct train remain ed not yet economically profitable relative to burning the lignin, given higher costs for producing the lignin coproduct than the amount of resulting coproduct revenue generated. Lignin valorization is a key priority moving forward for future focus in ultimately contributing to minimum fuel selling price reductions toward 2030 goals (DAVIS; BARTLING, 2022) . Biochemicals and biomaterials can serve as an economic driver for a biorefinery (WERPY; PETERSEN, 2004 ). In 2007 the International Energy Agency started the Task 42 (Biorefining in a Circular Economy) with the objective of, among others, map and address gaps and barriers to biorefineries deployment. An important barrier is the lack of conversion technol ogies that makes the choice of appropriate products for addition to the biorefinery´s portfolio a complex challenge (BOZELL; PETERSEN, 2010) . Several studies have made important contributions indicating potential bioproducts based on yields, price, market size, and othe r factors (BOZELL; PETERSEN, 2010; JONG et al., 2011; STRAATHOF; BAMPOULI, 2017; WERPY; PETERSEN, 2004) . Jong et al. (2020) reinforced the platforms as the most important feature that define a biorefinery once they are key intermediates between raw materials and final products and can be used to link different biorefinery concepts with tar get markets. Ethylene and ethylene glycol are important platforms cited by the IEA Task 42 and they highligh t the ethylene platform can be readily produced through the dehydration of bioethanol but observed that considering typical ethylene facilities scale a single bio ethylene plant would be a considerable consumer of ethanol. (Jong et. al, 2011) . Ethanol, which is the biggest biochemical produced today (ANNEVELINK et al., 2022) , can be treated as a platform once many products can be obtained as the proper ethylene (ROSALES -CALDERON; ARANTES, 20 19). However, t he anticipated growth in biochemicals production capacity (excluding bioethanol) has not materialised yet. The main reasons for this lack of growth include the significantly lower oil prices compared to a decade ago, the different economi es of scale of fossil -based plant capacities versus biobased plant capacities, high feedstock costs as well as the lack of policies, which would facilitate the transition to a biobased economy (DE JONG et There are multiple sources of uncertainties, and they can be devided into 5 main classes: Cost, Profits (values), Production Process, Extern and Nature of biomass (ESPINOZA PÉREZ et al., 2017) . Raw material seasonality and process technology scale are directly associated to those classes of uncertainties. Albeit scale and seasonality are key elements for biorefineries availability it seems there are not enough studies dedicated to deeply understand how those factor s impact the different possible biorefineries configuration s. Espinoza Pérez et al. (2017) after revise the recent research (72 published articles from 2006 to 2015 ) on design and man agement optimization of biorefiney supply chains observed that regarding the application of the technological dimension of sustainability, even though it has been considered in 36% of the publications, the vast majority has only evaluated the choice of production technologies, without assessing technological learning, economies of scale or the development of new technologies. These are issues that could help improve the profitability of enterprises, encouraging more private investment in the field (ESPINOZA PÉREZ et al., 2017) .", "Sukumura et al. (2013) used process modeling and multi -objetive mixed integer linear programing (MILP) to develop a tool for sustainable biorefining that can be used to guide local stakeholders and policy makers to informed decisions about the po tential for integrated biorefinering. Authors have proposed a biorefinery producing energy products processing corn stover, forest residues and chicken litter and focused on capturing extensive results like the effect of change in feedstock availability an d capacity on project economics and potential biorefinery locations. AspenPlus® simulations were used for calculating the maximum amount of biofuels that could be produced based on local biomass availability and Aspen Process Economic Analyzer ® was used to size and estimate the detailed capital, labor, mainte nance, and plant overhead costs for the three capacities. However, as the study was focused on the finding optimum transportation cost authors used a linear function to correlate capital cost and plant capacity. Sharma et. al. (2011) also used MILP to propose a model for technology and product portfolio de sign for a multi -product multi -platform biorefinering . Their model aims to provide decision support in ma king strategic decisions with the objective of maximizing the stakeholder value (SHARMA; SARKER; ROMAGNOLI, 2011) . There were considered four different options of biomass (corn stover, wheat straw, switchgrass, and miscanthus) and two types of lipids ( waste oi and soy -bean oil), thus t he model should select between biochemical and thermochemical process technologies to produce ethanol, biodiesel, succinic acid, propanediol and steam. Process technology selection considered parameters such as Investiment Capital, processing cost , fixed costs, product yied coming from other studies (including NREL ones) and scale adjusts were made using arbitrary expoents. Geraili and Romagnoli (2015) included the use of AspenPlus® models in a multiobjective optimization for design of integrated biorefineries , those models were mainly based on NREL´s references . For the scale evaluation they varied the base capacity between +/-75% and the resultant costs for each capacity were calculated by scaling the cost using power law eaquation (Equation 15) (GERAILI; ROMAGNOLI, 2015) . S. de Jong et al. (2017) used geographically -explicit cost optimization model to analyze the impac t of and interrelation between four cost reduction strategies for biofuel production from wood in Sweden: economies of scale, intermodal transport, integration with existitng industries, and distributed supply chain configurations. For economies of scale, they used factorial approach –cost objects methodology where costs are estimated using factors and percentages based on the purchased equipment cost obtained in the literature for any scale and applied the power law equation using scaling factors between 0 .6 and 0.79 (JONG et al., 2017) . NREL´s reports have contributed with other important studies (GERAILI; SALAS; ROMAGNOLI, 2016; SHARMA; VLOSKY; ROMAGNOLI, 2013) that addressed significant aspects regarding not only biorefineries pr ocess but all the supply chain. Corn stover and forest residues are two relevant alternative s source s to conventional petroleum transportation fuels for the United States.", "In the Brazilian case , sugarcane has played a strategic role in the energy matrix as well as in the economy and can be turned in a source of carbon being valorized in a biorefinery (BONOMI, 2016) . One of the first published studies containing sugarcane mill process modeling using AspenPlus® was done in a collaboration with NREL (SEABRA et al., 2010) and was focused on boost ethanol production converting sugarcane residues ( bagasse and trash) through thermochemical or biochemical routes. They proposed an autonomous di stillery processing 1,000 tonnes of sugarcane per hour and operationg 4,000 hours per year . This distillery was converted in a biorefinery by coupling a bagasse biochemical conversion route and a thermochemical one. Both routes were adapted from NREL´s processes models , which did not conside r sugarcane as raw material . The biochemical process was based on corn stover and the thermochemical on hardwood. The economic analysis was only performed for the adjacent conversion plants and based on NREL data. Sensit ivity analysis regarding scale was p erformed varying +/ - 50% the sugarcane mill process capacity and its impacts on the minimum ethanol selling price measured, however no detail was given about how the cost differences was treated. For all scenarios they tested both routes finding minimum se lling prices quite similar. Dias et al. (2009) also proposed process simulation (using UniSim Design®) to evaluate the bagasse second -generation ethanol coproduction but only considering technical parameters and found a potential to increase bioethanol pro duction in 26% (DIAS et al., 2009) .", "Seabra and Macedo (2011) used the same model derived from NREL (Seabra et a l., 2010) to perform a comparative analysis for power generation and ethanol production from sugarcane residual biomass in Brazil where on one option the unit would produce 91 litters of ethanol per toone of cane and export 130 kWh/t of cane, while the oth er option the ethanol production would be 124 litters/t of cane with an electricity surplus of 50kWh/t (SEABRA; MACEDO, 2011) . They have found a higher return on investme nt for the power -oriented option. Dias et al. (2011) used SuperPro Designer applied process simulation and economic ana lysis to compare two biomass pretreatment methods . Costs estimate was performed using data provided by a Brazilian equipment manufacturer and changes in equipment capacity had its cost adjusted considering a coefficient of 0.6 (DIAS et al., 2011) . Investment data was presented aggregated, and it was not clear how the ancillary costs were treated denoting a more simplified approach for the economic model. The pretreatment routes were compared regarding its internal rate of return (IRR) and ethanol costs, sensitivity analy sis was only carried out for sugarcane cost and enzyme cost . As well as in the United S tates corn stover analysis , the first studies focused only on energy products. Albeit t he processing of sugarcane is a successful example of renewable bioenergy being produced on a large industrial scale and it is the world largest crop by production quantity, around 1 ,907 million of tons of sugarcane were globally produced in 2020 (FREITAS et al., 2021) , when simple research is performed in ScienceDirect platform only return s 386 publications for the term “sugarcane biorefinery” while in the same period the term “bioferine ry” standalone returned 20,487 . It shows there are enormous opportun ities for original scientific works related to sugarcane biorefineries as well as need to contribute with the sustainable exploitation of this important bioresource in biorefinery systems. Despite the small volume of studies there are important works available dealing with sugarcane b iorefineries development.", "J. Moncada et al. (2013) performed techno -economic analysis for a sugarcane biorefinery based in Colombia. They selected five products : sugar that represents food security, fuel ethanol representing biofuels, electricity as bioene rgy (biofuels refer to liquid fuels as indirect energy), PHB for the biomaterial’s family and anthocyanins from cell cultures representing the biomolecules family. AspenPlus® and Matlab® were used to generate the mass and energy balances through rigorous simulation including the implementation of kinetic models available in the scientific literature such as for fermentation for fuel ethanol and PHB production. Capita l and operating costs were calculated using Aspen Economic Analyzer® and Colombian specific parameters such as income tax were adjusted. It is worthy to mention in this thesis only the capital costs are obtained with Aspen Economic Analyzer. A fixed capaci ty of 1,752,000 tonnes of sugarcane per year was set and scenarios mounted based on distributions and technologies . The economic assessment considered the relationship between products sale price and total production cost for each product. Scale and season ality were not considered in their study.", "Bonomi et. al. (2016) proposed a powerful simulation tool (the Virtual Sugarcane Biorefinery – VSB) , which consists in a simulation platform that allows the evaluation of the integration of new alternatives for the sugarcane sector – cellulosic ethanol and other product s, new agricultural strategies for sugarcane production, as well as different strategies for ethanol and other products used as biofuels and biochemicals . The VSB integrates the sugarcane production chain having modeled and simulated agricultural, industrial and usage sectors. For industrial sector processes modeling AspenPlus® was used and components of the lignocellulosic material (cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin) were obtained also from NREL s tudies (WOOLEY; PUTSCHE, 1996) reinforcing the importance of th eir contribution to biorefinery evaluation s. They have built models for the first-generation process (with sugar, ethanol, and electricity as outputs), biochemical rout e for the second -generation process (producing ethanol and electricity), thermochemical rout e for second - generation ethanol and electricity production . Three different levels of det ail are employed in the economic analysis , mainly regarding cost estimation, where on the more detailed one a capital cost database was developed by gathering data from literature and from industrial equipment suppliers, engineering offices, experts, and consultant specialists. This thesis will show using Aspen Process Economic Analyzer costs databank it is possible to obtain representative results for sugarcane biorefineries evaluation . Several scenarios of sugarcane bioref ineries were evalua ted, mainly of those scenarios tested energy products production including biobutanol , which is a chemical precursos of paints, polymers, and plastics . Albeit different capacities were simulated , no specific evaluation regarding scale was performed and for all scenarios the haverst period was fixed in 200 days. L.G. Pereira et al. (2015) evaluated the viability of n -butanol production integrated within a first and second generation sugarcanebiorefinery using the VSB. Implications of uncertainties related to techno - economic and marketing parameters used in the models within the VSB were observed . Their biorefinery was set to processes 500 tonnes of sugarcane (wet basis) per hour, yielding approximately 2 million ton nes of sugarcane per year and four scenarios with different technology approach were considered. Investiment costs were estimated based on data from literature and no details w ere available regarding costs adjusts in function of capacities differences. Several technical factors (such a s conversion, recovery, purity, etc) as well as economic parameters had its impacts observed in the products selling price and projects internal rate of return. Authors have found promising results for n -butanol production in terms of revenues per tonne of processed sugarcane, but less encouraging for IRR due to the higher investment required compared to that for autonomous ethanol biorefinery.", "Albarelli (2013) used AspenPlus® to perform process simulation for two scenarios: the integration of second -genera tion ethanol production process to the joint production of sugar and ethanol ; and second -generation ethanol production integrated to an autonomous distillery and producing only ethanol . It was evaluated for both scenarios the use of bagasse pith (P -fraction) for ethanol production and compared to the use of bagasse to enhance electricity production in the cogeneration system of the mill (ALBARELLI, 2013) . Four flowsheeting models was prepared: autonomous distilley, conventional mill, cogeneration system and second -generation ethanol. The second - generation process simulation was an adaptation of the procedure described experimentally in previous studies to an industrial proces s, demons trating the application of the simulation tools in the technology cost -benefit measurement. The components cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin and enzymes were added to simulator database using the data from NREL (WOOLEY; PUTSCHE, 1996) . Economic analysis considered fixed capital costs, production costs and revenues. Investment costs were obtained in different ways and production costs were not detailed , apparently only the main variable costs were considered: sugarcane, sugarcane trash and enzyme . The investment costs for the conventional processes w ere gathered straight from the literature. For second -generation, sugarcane -trash handling, and cogeneration system they calculated equipment costs using Aspen Economic Analyzer® or data available at literature but was not specific. Chemical Engineering Process Cost Index was used to update the equipment costs to the yea r of 2012 and correlated capacity to costs considering a coefficient of 0.6 . Biorefinery process capacity was fixed on 500 tonnes of sugarcane per hour for all scenarios . Sensitivity analysis was performed for cogeneration investment, enzyme cost and secon d-generation ethanol price. Authors have also demonstrated the benefits of thermal integration finding steam reductions up to 44% and bagasse consumption reduction up to 45%. The economic analysis showed that second generation process integrated to the joint production presented lower payback time, 2.3 years, in comparison with this process integrated to the autonomous distillery, 4.7 years, and higher NPV and IRR. Thus, they conclude that product diversification offered by the mill has on the viability of second -generation process, representing that among other factors the biorefinary concept from sugarcane can enhance the chances of this future green -process not only as an economic attractive process but also an environmentally friendly perspe ctive to the Brazilian sugarcane mills.", "Indeed, by adding new processes in existing, sugarcane mills can become biorefineries based on several products that can be obtained through conversion technologies already available, however, t o compare the feasibil ity of biorefineries following the thermochemical and biochemical pathways or biorefineries with different complexity based on the implemented technology, the economic performance of each biorefinery should be thoroughly investigated (MANDEGARI; FARZAD; GÖRGENS, 2017a) . Albarelli et al. (2015) used the previous simulation model ( ALBARELLI , 2013) to evaluate a sugarcane biorefinery producing first an d second -generation ethanol, synthetic natural gas (SNG) and electricity. Throught this case study authors aimed to elucidating how process system engineering tools such as thermal process integration, life cycle analysis, economic evaluation, and multi -objective optimization cancontribute to minimizing some future challenges of the industrial implementation of supercritical fluid-based technologies (ALBARELLI et al., 2015a) . The supercritical water gasification was dedicated to SNG production from three main waste flows of the ethanol production process: pentose -rich stream; lignin -rich stream; and vinasse stream . The process simulation was built in other plataform (Belsim Vali Software®). After solving mass and energy balances in both simulation softwares (AspenPlus and Belsim) they used a computation platform that was built in Matla b® by École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne in Switzerland (OSMOSE - Multi -Objective OptimiZation of integrated Energy Systems , in English ) to perform optimizations, sensitivity analysis, pareto curve analysis, etc . The economic analysis was performed in a simpler way, total investment costs were estimated by sizing the major equipments and calculating their purchase cost (main equipments and how the purchase cost is calculates were not specified) and multiplication fa ctors applied to consider indirect expenses . Production costs were only based on main ones (sugarcane, electricity, and enzymes). However, be sides economic analysis authors have implemented multi - objective optimization aiming to minimizing the total invest ment costs and maximizing the exergy efficiency , environmental assessment , sensitivity analysis and proposed process performance indicators to estimate the conversion potential of different plant configuration for a sugarcane biorefinery. They only considered the Brazilian center - south region and fixed the sugarcane process capacity in 500 tonnes per hour.", "Economic simplifications and fixed capacity are useful to deal with such nu mber of different analyses . Studies focusing on scale and seasonality could complement this kind of optimization -oriented evaluations. In another study (ALBARELLI et al., 2015b) they applied the same approach to evaluate a biorefinery composed by an autonomous distillery coupled to a thermochemical process producing methanol (in place of SNG) . For a fixed capacity the best result t hey found indicated methanol production costs 30% higher than its market price on analized period .", "Most of the produced ethanol worldwide is consumed as transportation fuel, whereas it is an important building block for other advanced biofuels and bio -chemicals as well (Rosales-Calderon et . al, 2019). Overall, in petroleum refineries, 15% of the entire barrel of oil is consumed to produce chemicals, whereas chemicals account for nearly 50% of the refinery profits (MARY J. BIDDY, CHRISTOPHER SCARLATA, 2016) .", "Mandegari et al. (2017) prepared a concise review on techno -economic ass essment s carried out considering different biofuels, biochemicals and biopolymers from different parts of sugarcane (i.e., juice, molasses, bagasse, and trash). Among the revised studies fifteen aimed to assess only biofuel production, four evaluated the co - production of biofuels and biochemicals/biopolymers, and two focused only on biochemicals/biopolymers (MANDEGARI; FARZAD; GÖRGENS, 2017b) . Three biofuel -oriented studies considered the production of Jet fuel where ethanol can play an important role due the ethanol dehydration rout e (ALVES et al. , 2016; DIEDERICHS et al., 2016; SANTOS et al., 2018) . No study considered in this review focused on scale neither seasonality evaluation.", "Diederichs et al. (2016) performed techno -economic assessments on five processes technology , those considering lignocellulosic feedstock : 1) the GFT -J (gasification and FT synthesis) process, 2) the L -ETH-J (biochemical conversion to ethanol with upgrading) process and 3) the SYN -FER-J (gasification, syngas fermentation to ethanol with upgrading) process. And t he processes considering 1G feedstock are 4) the HEFA (hydroprocessing of vegetable oil) process and 5) the S -ETH-J (sugar cane juice to ethanol by sucrose fermentation with upgrading) process. Mass and energy balances were constructed for all five processes based on the Aspen Plus ® process simulation, whilst the economics of these processes were investigated based on cash flow analysis as well as an economic sensitivity analy sis. The cost analysis was performed for process plants located in the USA and equipment cost obtained from Aspen Plus economic package, which has less accuracy compared to Aspen Process Economic Analyzer (used in this thesis) . Three of the five evaluated routes have ethanol dehydration to ethylene step demonstra ting the importance of this route to achieve sustainable aviation fuels. However, due the number of different processes in each rout the ethanol dehydration step did not receive a special attention . Scale was not a matter of analysis, and the sugarcane -based case was evaluated for only one capacity: 222 tonnes of sugarcane per hour. Alves et al. (2016) evaluated the co - production of biojet fuels and biochemicals from different feedstocks : sugar crops , oil crops and lignocellulosic biomass. Among the assessed production biojet production routes the ethanol -to-jet and hydro -processed esters and fatty acids (HEFA) were the most attractive and succinic acid was the most promising chemical intermediate. Sugarcane was the most promising feedstock for a biorefinery in the region of Minas Gerais, while soybean was the most promising feedstock for a biorefi nery in the region of Rio Grande do Sul . Several scenarios of the co -production of biojet and biochemical s were pre-screened based on economic potential what is the the difference between sales revenues and operation costs . Market prices was collected from the literature to calculate the sales revenue and operation costs (only raw material and utilities costs) was estimated based on previous feasibilities studies. The most attractive alternatives were selected to be assessed in a discount cash flow model. Investment reference values were taken from different sources and t he correction of the investm ent costs for the analyzed capacity was performed based on the six -tenth rule, considering a scale factor equal to 0.6. Seasonality was not considered onde th e calculations were based on an operation time of 24 hours/day for 300 days/year . An important con tribution from this thesis to the literature is therefore the determination of the economy of scale for ethanol dehydration process.", "The exploitation of sugarcane comprises one of the most successful cases of biorefinery, due to three major marketable products, specifically sugar, ethanol, and bioelectricity, as well a s its great diversity of derived by -products (VANDENBERGHE et al., 2022) . However, sugar -derived chemicals and materials could serve as an economic driver for expand sugarcane biorefiner ies b y integrating the production of higher value bioproducts into the biorefinery´s fu el and power output. Nevertheless, the integration of new chemical process in sugarcane mill has the challenge to avoid low occupation of the chemical plant along the year due the sugarcane off -season. Taked a et al. (2022) proposed and evaluated an anaerob ic structured bed reactor (AnSTBR) using vinasse as substrate in the haverst season and glycerol in the following off -season (TAKEDA et al., 2022) . This strate gy resulted in a positive economic balance. Sugarcane seasonality vary significantly among producers’ regions, even inside the same country and off -season periods can be the half year . Despite its importance , seasonality is less considered than scale in th e biorefineries studies.", "Besides its use as a transportation fuel blending agent, ethanol is also considered a potent platform chemical for the synthesis of other value -added chemicals including (poly)ethylene, ethylene oxide, ethylacetate, diethyl -ether, acetic acid, butanol, butadiene and Guerbet alcohols (ROSALES -CALDERON; ARANTES, 2019; STICHNOTHE et al., 2016; VANDENBERGHE et al., 2022) . In this thesis ethano l play the role of chemical plataform modulating the operational factor difference between the sugarcane mill and the bio-ethylene glycol . Ethylene glycol (EG) is an important organic compound and chemical intermediate used in a large number of industrial processes (e.g. energy, plastics, auto mobiles, and chemicals) . As the state -of-the-art invention by the Carbide Company of vapor -phase oxidation of ethylene to ethylene oxide (EO) — a precursor for EG synthesis via hydration — became cheaply available, the industrial production of EG has been widespread since 1953 (YUE et al., 2012) . Although the oil-based route still the mainly EG production route there are more than 15 large -scale plants using the coal to ethylene glycol p rocess in China , however the CO 2 reduction and utilization is crucial for this route viability (YANG et al., 2019) . Nevertheless, th e bio -ethylene glycol is a promising alternative being investigated in China . Zhao et al. (2021) proposed and evaluated the bio -ethylene glycol production from Miscanthus, a perennial plant crop with high yield potential . Authors have simulated the the process based on lab -scale experimental results in AspenPlus®. They proposed a plant operating 8,000 hour per years and producing 100 kilo tonnes per year of bio -ethylene glycol. Total production cost (TPC), including fixed cost, variable cost, and byproducts revenue, was conducte d to evaluate the cost competitiveness of bio -EG with petro -EG and coal-EG. Capital investment and operating costs were obtained from previous works (pre -treatmen costs were based on NREL works eventhough it was developed for other raw material – corn stov er) and from Aspen Process Economic Analyzer. Several parameters (miscanthus collection efficiency, transport distance, hydrogen input, process water input, electricity input, Raney nickel input, tungstic acid input, sodium hydroxide input, lime input, diols production, and EG yield ) had their effects evaluated through a sensitivity analysis . Scale was not matter of analysis in this study. Techno -economic analysis reveal ed that the total production cost of bio -ethylene glycol was 43.3% and 20.4% h igher than that of coal -based ethylene glycol and petro -based ethylene glycol , however, bio -ethylene glycol offers the greatest energy and climate benefits. In addition, a carbon tax of 28 and 90 United States Dollar per tonne of CO 2 equivalent are the bre akeven points to reach economic benefits of bio -ethylene glycol compared to petro -ethylene glycol and coal-ethylene glycol , respectively (ZHAO et al., 2021b) .", "The case study developed in this thesis stands out regarding the literature as it present s a rigorous scale and seasonality assessment for a sugarcane biorefinery located in Brazil. Despite scale is widely recognized as an essential issue in the biorefineries design and several studies have considered this variable on their assessments, as demonstrated through this literature review scale was not the main uncertainty evaluated. Also, scale effect s in biorefineries performance can vary depending on the location regardle ss all other assumptions keep the same what make biorefineries viability located relative .", "Even though there are more structured value chains using lignocellulosic biomass, ocean resources represent a huge opportunity for the biorefineries development. In 2017, the United Nations General Assembly proclaimed that 2021 -2030 would serve as the United Nations Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development (or ‘Ocean Decade’) (UNESCO, 2021) . The ocean contains the most abundant valuable ecological resources of the earth. Sustainable us e of these marine -based natural products would help in modern -day applications of pharmaceutical, nutraceutical, cosmeceutical, and food industries what push the development of technologies for the sustainable evolution of blue -based commercial products such as biofuels, bioplastics, food, chemicals, enzymes, and other essential commodities . The marine environment constitutes an infinite resource of valuable novel bioactive compounds from marine organisms such as bacteria, algae, sponges, fish, invertebrate s, bryozoans, tunicates, and molluscs. Bioactive compounds from these organisms are effectively used in new therapeutic agents, human nutrition with highly specific target molecules especially enzymes (PRABHA et al., 2019) . Marine macroalgae are mostly benthic organisms that are divided into three major groups accord ing to their photosynthetic pigments: green, red, and brown seaweeds (SUDHAKAR et al., 2018) . Brown algae , for example , are rich in vitamins, minerals, and proteins, what provide indispensable benefits on human health (PLAZA; CIFUENTES; IBÁÑEZ, 2008) . The U.S. Department of Energy included macroa lgae as an important potential contributor to wards meeting the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 . Marine biomass can supplement terrestrial biomass as a source of feedstock for biofuel production and would not compete with an existing supply chain for food or other commercial products (ROESIJADI; JONES; Making biofuel economical from algal biomass requires the co -production of additional useful biochemical components that are unique to algae and that have a proven market value (BAGHEL et al., 2015) . Balina et al. (2017) pr esented a seaweed biorefinery concept focusing on Baltic Sea region and carried out a qualitative analysis about its role in sustainable bioeconomy (BALINA; ROMAGNOLI; BLUMBERGA, 2017) . They assumed a conceptual model for high value -added product production along with production of biofuels . Authors obser ved using b iomass with maximum efficiency the expenses related to fuel production are reduced and conclude that seaweed biorefinery concept can make a significant contribution to sustainable development by adding value to the original biobased feedstock , being crucial to understanding of the overall technological processes and pathways. Seaweed conversion into wide spect rum of products using cascade conversion should be adapted to local conditions. A new selective biorefinery process for the extraction of multiple seaweed polysaccharides has been proposed by Abraham et al. (2019) and a n optimum condition for the acid extraction step was found (ABRAHAM et al., 2019) . The process can produce three polysaccharide products of fucoidan/laminarin, acidic extractable alginate and alkaline extractable alginate , however any economic evaluation was performed on this study. X. Zhang and M. Thomsen et al. (2021) proposed and assessed a biorefiney system producing food -grade laminarin, fucoidan, alginate, and protein from brown macroalgae Laminaria digitata, Fucus v esiculosus, and Saccharina latissimi based on pilot and lab scale data (ZHANG; THOMSEN, 2021) . Net Present Value (NPV) was adopted as an economic feasibility indicator while economic profitability was measured by the pay-back period . Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) was also to better acquire knowledge of the key techno -economic barriers and potential profitability and opportunities for commercialising and upscaling the investigated biorefinery systems. Capital investment (TCI), annual operating cost (AOC), and annual net revenue (ANR) were estimated based on the factored -cost method. Based on pilot and la b data an industrial scale facility was proposed and assess ed. They obtain ed NPVs of 186–454 Mio EUR from an assumed 15 -year project span including 1-year construction and 14 -year operation. However, as revealed by the sensitivity analysis, the systems are potentially susceptible to fluctuations in feedstock and product prices . Scale was not matter of analysis .", "Sargassum muticum (Yendo) Fensholt (also known as wire weed) is a brown alga that is native to Japan, China, and Korea, where it is served as a feed source for holothurian or abalone aquaculture (ZHAO et al., 2008) . It is an invasive species on the western coast of North America, from Alaska to Mexico, and in Europe, from Norway to Portugal. On the western coast of North America, S. muticum is reportedly abundant (MILLER; AGUILAR -ROSAS; PEDROCHE, 2011) . S. muticum's dispersion is attrib uted to factors such as high growth rates (c.a. 2 -4 cm per day), long life span, high fecundity, the capacity of self -fertilization, and both natural dispersal mechanisms and human action (e.g., with oysters). It causes displacement of native species throu gh over-growing and shading underlying specie. It is also considered a significant nuisance, blocking propellers and intakes, causing fouling on oyster beds and fishing nets, as well as interfering with the recreational use of waterways. Control methods fo r this species have limited effectiveness since it quickly regrows. Introduction in North America dates back to the 1940s (MILLER; AGUILAR -ROSAS; PEDROCHE, 2011) .", "Estimates on the volumes of S. muticum present in the oceans are rare since it has limited commercial exploitation. For example, after mechanical clearing trials in southern England during the 1970s and early 1980s, no use was found for the collected algae (CRITCHLEY; FARNHAM; MORRELL, 1986) . Nonetheless, these volumes tend to be high. For example, in the UK, a manual removal operation recovered 450 tons in 1975 (DAVISON, 2009) ; and in Venice Lagoon (Italy), it was estimated the presence of 4,825 tons in 1992 (SFRISO et al., 2020) . On the western coast of North America, S. muticum is reportedly abundant (MILLER; AGUILAR -ROSAS; PEDROCHE, 2011) . Therefore, S. muticum stands as a good target for commercial exploitation to reduce its negative impacts in the marine environments where it is an invader while adding value to cheap marine biomass (MILLEDGE; NIELSEN; BAILEY, 2015) . Early assessments did not indicate it as an adequate fertilizer or source of alginic acid (due to poor quality and yield) (CRITCHLEY; FARNHAM; MORRELL, 1986) . However, there have been many recent attempts to develop processes that generate value from S. muticum , including plant biostimulants/fertilizers (ABDEL LATEF et al., 2017; SILVA; BAHCEVANDZIEV; PEREIRA, 2019) ; fucoidan (heteropolymers containing substantial percentages of L -fucose and sulfate ester groups, but also galactose and trace xylose) (ÁLVAREZ -VIÑAS et al., 2019; KURNIALAHI et al., 20 20), which can be used in pharmaceuticals, cosmetics and nutraceuticals (RESEARCH, 2021; SEN, 2020) ; lipid for us e in nutraceuticals and other applications where its antioxidant activity can be attractive (SANTOS et al., 2020) ; fucoxanthin (VIEIRA; VENTURA, 2019) , a carotenoid used, for example, for prevention and treatment of obesity (Beijing Gingko Group, 2021); biogas (MANEEIN et al., 2021; MILLEDGE et al., 2018; SOTO et al., 2015) ; bioethanol (DEL RÍO et al., 2019) ; and alginate, although its yield is relatively low (5 -11%) when compared to other commercial ly exploited brown algae (16 -30%) (MAZUMDER et al., 2016; MILLEDGE, 2016) . The residue obt ained after alginate extraction from this alga can also be used as a low -cost adsorbent for hexavalent chromium or methylene blue in aqueous wastes (EL ATOUANI et al., 2019) . The wide variety of possible products derived from S. muticum indicate an opportunity of using it as feedstock for a biorefinery (MILLEDGE; NIELSEN; BAILEY, 2015) . Biorefineries processing S. muticum have been envisioned. Balboa et al. (2015) propose methods to obtain six products with potential nutraceutical, cosmetic and pharmaceutical applications (BALBOA; MOURE; DOMÍNGUEZ, 2015) . Flórez -Fernández et al. (2019), in turn, disclose a simultaneous extraction of alginate, fucoidans, and phlorotannins (with antioxidant activity) from this alga also configuring a biorefinery (ÁLVAREZ - VIÑAS et al., 2019) . Flórez -Fernández et al. (2021) later continued their efforts, describing a laboratory -scale integrated approach to add value to S. muticum (FLÓREZ -FERNÁNDEZ et al., 2021) .", "There appears to have been little work on the economics of valorisation of marine feedstock in special S. muticu m macroalgae (MILLEDGE; NIELSEN; BAILEY, 2015) , despite marine seaweed is a promising feedstock for bioenergy and biochemical production due to its extensive geographical distribution and advantages over the terrestrial plant (SUDHAKAR et al., 2018) . There are numerous challenges associated with the successful deployment of marine biorefinery generating several profit uncertainties . Among major sources of uncertainty for marine biorefinery d eployment scalability and investment costs can be better understood through techno -economic feasibility studies (ALEXANDER GOLBERG, MEIRON ZOLLMANN, MEGHANATH PRABHU, 2020) given that conversion process and integrated biorefinery approach is the key factor for sustainable utilization of seaweed in future (SUDHAKAR et al., 2018) . Finally , as demonstrated through this literature review, this thesis originally contributes to the scientific literature with two remarkable case studies developed using the same methodology that is like those reviewd in this chapter . Scale and seasonal ity, for the first case study, and scale and by -product choice, for the second case study, had its effects evaluated in the viability of biorefineries systems potential ly located in Brazil and in the United States what had not been done before. Considering Brazilian potential to host a low carbon industry, especially due the existing infrastructure, the number of studies dedicated to exploring the uncountable possible scenari os is scarce. Questions addressed in this thesis regarding scale, seasonality and product portfolio still being bottlenecks for biorefineries devopoment. Also, despite United States have much more related biorefinery studies pu blished than Brazil the case study proposed in this thesis for marine biorefineries is novel and can either support the process development once the case study is based on bench scale experiments.", "Chapter 3 - Methodology The methodology developed and applied by this thesis is based on a rigorous process simulation and costs estimates supported by Aspen Engineering Software (mainly Aspen Plus and Aspen Process Economics Analyzer) . This method was built up mainly based on the NREL studies described on the previous chapter. The majorit y of studies available in the literature use s supplier quotations and installation cost factors to estimate CAPEX using the Aspen Process Economic Analyzer software estimat ing investme nt costs . Therefore, the final version of the methodology developed in this thesis is robust enough to analyze a broad range of diferent biorefinery processes systems. The whole method can be divided into 5 main steps , which are described below :", "1. Representi ng and evaluating the Process (literature review) – Through an extensive literature review (patents, scientific articles, specialized reports, technical books, etc.) a Block Flow Diagram (BFD) (see Figure 1 for an example) is generated giving the first view of the process. The BFD must be composed by the main operation unit s that compose the inside battery limits (ISBL) of the process . The BFD facilitate the process comprehension and will guide the process data (raw material composition, pressures, temperatures, reactions stoichiometry, kinetic parameters, etc.) collection . Thus, it can support the process detail ment and the specification of the main equipment s defining the technology and generating the ISBL Process Flow Diagram (PFD) (example in Figure 2) alongside de process description . Based on th e literure review it is possible to evaluate if the desired process is technicaly feasible . The technical feasib ility evaluation i s a qualitat ive assessment that indicates if there are enough information to rep resent the process and whether with that information the resulted process has factibility or not . For example: if the reported yields are too low the process must have a high number of recycle streams what can indicate the process is not scalable . If the process is technicaly feasible the information collected in the literature review is used to categorize process features accordingly Table 1. This classificatio n is proposed to better adjust the Capital and Operational costs parameters values according to Turton et al. (2018) range (TURTON, 2018) . That categorization will support the next step s.", "Figure 1: Example – Block flow diagram for polymer -grade ethylene production.", "Figure 2: Example - PFD for ethanol dehydration reaction unit.

Process Simulation Diagram (PSD) – Based on the PFD and data collected, a PSD (Process Simulation Diagram – example in Figure 3) is built in the Aspen Plus® to generate mass and energy balance which are the inputs for the next steps. This phase is concluded when th e simulation converges, and results are consistent between each other and with researched literature. The simulation convergence is reached when the mass and energy balance is solved generating streams compositions, processes condititions (temperature, pre ssure, etc.) and all the information needed to support the next step of the analysis . Complex process es can face a harder convergence solution, being the worst cases to reach the process convergence those associated with process es with an elevate d number of rec ycle streams . Also, even when the mass and energy balance is solved, and the convergence is reached, it is important to check if the results are consistent. For example, the final convergence can generate non desirable or acceptable solution for an equipment or stream temperature or pressure leading to a high material cost . When the simulation capacity is modified a new convergence step is necessary . Once the simulation converges and the results are consistent the calculated demand for utilities must be considered to generate the outside battery limit process (OSBL). Usually, the OSBL is composed by boilers to attend the heat demand, cooling tower producing cooling water as well as water and efluents treatment , raw material, and product storage . The outside battery limit can be simulated as an auxiliary facility to meet the process utilities demand and the results are part of the process being investigated. When necessary, however, the OSBL can be designed and simul ated to meet several process es need .", "Figure 3: Example – PSD for e thanol dehydration 3. Costs Estimates and Process Database – The PSD (ISBL and OSBL) developed in Aspen Plus® is transfered to Process Economic Analyzer® (Aspen PEA) to generate the Cost of Capital (CAPEX) estimates for each capacity simulated in the step 2. When the PSD is transferred from AspenPlus to Aspen PEA all the equipments simulated are automatically maped for the cos t estimate. This procedure results in better estimates rather than using the AspenPlus ® CAPEX plugin . The plugin poorer accuracy is due simplifications made in order to quickly generate CAPEX estimates. When estimating CAPEX using the A spen PEA it is necessary to set several assumptions that have considerable effects in costs estimate . Those assumptions include: the costs database through setting the project location (Aspen PEA have cost database for the United States, Europe, United Kingdom and Japan) ; proces control system (Analog, DDCTL – Distributed Digital, or PLC – Programmable Logic Controllers ); design code (ASME, JIS – Japanese code, DIN – german code, etc.) ; Soil type (soft clay, firm clay , wet sand , dry sand, etc. ); area type (GRADE , PAD, OPEN , EX-OPEN and FLOOR ). In this thesis the project location is defined for the United States, the PLC is the control system (conservative assumption once this is the most expensive option), the design code is ASME , soil type is the soft clay, and the area is OPEN for ISBL and GRADE for OSBL. The estimated CAPEX can be adjusted for different location by using locations factors available in the technical literature (or developing a cost location analysis) and setting an exchange rate . After setting those assumptions it is necess ary to check all the equipments regarding the material, capacity, des ign pressure, design temperature, dimensions (diameter, height, length, and width ). Equip ments parameters can vary depending on the type . Also, in this step it is necessary to adjust whether some equipments, such as heat exchangers, need spare capacity or not. For simulation strategy purpose it is comon that equipments represented in the PFD are not represented in the PSD. Pumps are usually not repre sented in stationary simulations, and it must be added manually in the Aspen PEA considering spare units to each one. Besides the pumps, another example of this strategy is the needless of residence tanks in stationary simulations. In those cases it is important to add manually the equipments depicted in the PFD that were not used in the PSD. Once set the assumptions and adjusted the equipment parameters details it is necessary to set the plant dimensions. Aspen PEA needs height, lengt h, and width for OPEN areas while only length and width are necessary for GRADE areas. Thus, it is necessary to estimate plant total area (ISBL and OSBL when it is considered as part of the investment) based on the main equipment size. For vertical equipme nts only diameter is considered whilst for horizontal ones beyond diameter the length is accounted for the Equipment Total Area (ETA) calculation. As a rule, it is added 1.5 meters to each equipment side regarding Equation 1 (for vertical equipments) and Equation 2 (for horizontal equipments) . Equation 1", "Equation 2 When all main Equipment Total Area is calculated, the Plant Total Area (PTA) is estimated following Equation 3 and informed to Aspen PEA procede with the CAPEX estimation.", "Equation 3 For ISBL area height , a minimum of 10 meters is applied. W hen there is a equipment taller (as distillation columns) its height is considered as the minimum plant height. By detailing the equipments and plant information Aspen PEA return s a detailed CAPEX estimation , presenting equipment costs and all the installation (spare parts, equipment installation, and unfores een equipments) and ancillary costs (pipes, painting, thermal insulation , instrumentation, electrification, buildings, and steel) . This approach , although laborious , generate high accuracy CAPEX estimates specially for more mature process thecnologi es.", "3.1. Capital Expenditure", "With the results provided by the A spen PEA, financial engineering rules (Turton et al., 2018) are applied to obtain the total fixed capital. The factors presented in Table 2 guarantee an accuracy between -50% and + 100% for the estimate, which is considered class four or five in the cost estimate classification system (AACE, 2020). The CAPEX accuracy will vary amon g class four and five depending on the TRL and process information availability (see Table 4) as the project contingency will be applied according to Table 3.

Operational Expenditure", "Basically, the Operational Expenditures (OPEX) has two major components: Variable costs (VC) and Fixed Costs. Variable operating costs are directly dependent on changes in the production rate. The variable OPEX is composed by the raw materials consumption, other chemical inputs and utilities. This is calculate d using the mass and energy balance and specific prices obta ined in specialized companies web site, international trade databases and literature . The mass and energy balance obtained from the Aspen Plus® simulations are then treated to provide all the technical coefficients, which are used to model the process variable costs. Those technical coefficients are calculated dividing material and energy c onsumptions by the main product production. Then, by multiplying each technical coefficient (mass material A / mass product ) by the respective price ($ / mass material A) the relationshio between each input cost and the final product output is obtained.", "Fixed operating costs are independent of changes in production rate. Fixed OPEX covers costs charged at constant rates even when the plant is not operational. These costs can be further divided into direct fixed costs, which are directly linked to production , and indirect fixed costs, which are not directly linked to production. The direct fixed costs are composed by: Ope rating Labor Costs (which includes operators, supervisors , office , maintenance, and laboratory), maintenance parts and materials, taxes, insurance, and royalties. Indirect fixed costs include administrative and general costs, selling and distribution, and research and development. Thus, based on Turton et al. (2018) either the direct and indirect costs are devided between those that can be related to the CAPEX (taxes, insurance, and maintenance) and others related to labor expenses. The operational expenditures (OPEX) are then calculated based on the methodology of Tu rton et al. (201 8), as shown in Equation 4.

Process Fact Sheets – Once the cost estimates and technical data are structured, a spreadsheet called “Process Fact Sheets” file (this study used an Excel file) is prepared containing all the process data generated (PFD, mass and energy balance for each process stream, equipment list, etc.) and economic evaluations (minimum selling price, net present value, cash flow analysis, sensitivity analysis, risk analysis, etc.). The technical data and process details from the Process Fact Sheets can also feed technical, environmental, and social assessments (carbon dioxide emission, specific energy consumption, process overall efficiency, job creation, etc.) being source f or a wide range of studies. Also, by generating Process Fact Sheet for different capacities of a same process it is possible to evaluate the process/product gains of scale. Finally, integrating two or more Process Fact Sheets generates several combinations of processes, and a biorefinery system can be emulated and evaluated.", "4.1. Net Present Value and Minimum Selling Price", "The discounted cash flow method is used to estimate Net Present Value and the Minimum Selling Price . Some assumptions must be made , including project lifetime in years , a corporate tax , a discount rate (this study applied a 10% per year discount rate), a depreciation method1, and a salvage value . Those assumptions can vary among different projects depending on several factors such as technolog y maturity and complexity, location specificities, etc. APEA gives the construction time, the personnel requirement, and the CAPEX. The discount rate is a matter of sensitivity analysis . The NPV is evaluated by Equation 5, given a product price and an interest rate of j. In Equation 5, n is the project life, and EPC is the engineering, procurement, and construction phase, which varies according to the plant's capacity. CF is the cash flow, which varies with the considered product price. The IRR is the value of the j which returns 0 in the NPV given a product price, as shown in Equation 6, and MSP is the value of the product price which returns 0 in the NPV, given that the M ARR is the Acceptable Minimum Rate of Return , LC is the Land Cost, WC the Working Capital and SV the Salvage Val ue, as shown in Equation 7. Moreover, the MSP together with other revenues, as the byproduct's credits, can be decomposed into its main expenditures, as shown in Equation 8.", "Equation 6", "Equation 7 𝑁𝑃𝑉 (𝐼𝑅𝑅 =𝑀𝐴𝑅𝑅 ,𝑀𝑆𝑃 )=𝐿𝐶+𝑊𝐶 +𝑆𝑉 (1+𝑀𝐴𝑅𝑅 )𝑛+𝐸𝑃𝐶+∑𝐶𝐹𝑖(𝑀𝑆𝑃 ) Equation 8 5. Biorefinery analysis – Based on each Process Fact Sheet related to every process composing the biorefinery system an integrated Process Sheet is prepared to produce the same sort of analysis for each process on an aggregated perspective. When integrated, the biorefinery CAPEX i s the sum of all ISBL of each evaluated process. The OSBL is then treated in the perspective of the system and its costs. It can be either treated as operational costs or as part of the system raw investment . In the first case, once the ISBL utilities (electricity, steam, water, etc) is obtained from the mass and energy balance the specific consumption for each utility is calculated by dividing the estimated consumption by the main product production (for example: kWh/ton ne of product A) . Hence, the costs of every demanded utility is considered in the variable costs using a reference price ($/kWh) . For the second case, considering the same specific consumption estimated , a facility to produce the utility (for example: electricity production from biomass) is modeled following this methodology and th e CAPEX is included in the overral investiment . Therefore, rather than buying electricity the project acquire s biomass and produce its own electricity in a self -generation power plant . Technical coefficients of the biorefinery are, usually, defined based on the main product of interest defined for the system , for example: after solving the mass balance , a relation between raw material and final product can be calculated obtaining a technical coefficient for the raw material consumption (tonne/to nne for the relationship between raw material and product ). By-products are also considered as revenue when they have an established market, and they contribute for the system feasibility.", "The economies of scale of processes and products can be evaluated by generating the process fact sheet (PFS) for different capacities. Several configurations of biorefineries can be simulated and evaluated by integrating two or more PFS. When integrated, the b iorefinery CAPEX is the sum of all the inside battery limits (ISBL) of each evaluated process. The economic feasibility study of the integrated system was conducted using the same methodology as described for individual systems. Moreover, given the uncerta inties associated with the development of biorefineries , it is worth performing sensibility and risk analysis . For uncertainties analysis , this study applied the Tornado diagram , which consists of independently changing the input variables to the limit val ues of their uncertainty ranges, verifying the resulting change in the economic metric in relation to its value in the base case. Hence, b y evaluating the magnitude of impact of each variable, it is possible to determine which parameters are most influenti al in the economic performance of the project , ceteris paribus . Besides, this study evaluated the p roject risks by applying the Monte Carlo method . The analysis of associated risks by the Monte Carlo method consists of a probabilistic method in which the impacts of uncertainty on the performance metric are evaluated simultaneously. The scenarios for evaluation are formed by values for each variable, based on their respective probability density functions. The project risk is then determined according to the percentage of scenarios that present a less than desired result.", "Thus, by performing both uncertainty and risk analysis it is possible to evaluate the technical (yield, residence time, etc.) and financial (raw material price, other prices, interest rate, etc.) parameters with the main impacts on feasibility criterias , such as minimum selling price and net present value .", "To facilitate the methodology comprehension a scheme was prepared to support the description. Fundamentally , the described methodology can be divided into three main dimensions : technical, economic, and financial . Each dimension is modeled using literature data that will be input for process design according to process engineering knowledge . Then, collected data and the process concept developed are the basis to feed process simulation tools , which are used to solve mass and ener gy balances, and spreadsheets that are used to model the project economically and financially .

Block flow diagram of the biorefinery. The biorefinery was assumed to be in Brazil . Location factor of 1.18 (SOLUTIONS, 2020a) is applied to convert the estimated CAPEX from the United States to Brazil . Three production sites were considered: the São Paulo and Paraná states, the Northeast region, and the South -central region (Minas Gerais state and mid -west region ) Those regions together respond for almost 90% of the ethanol produced in Brazil . The only commercially available technology (Technology Readiness Level 9) to obtain renewable MEG is the dehydration of ethanol to produce ethylene, which must be c onverted into ethylene oxide and then hydrolyzed to ethylene glycol (EG) (VERHAAK, 2015) . Ethanol dehydration technology is already operational in Brazil at a scale of 200 kilo tonnes per annum (KTPA). Process integration, including ethanol from sugarcane, ethylene from ethanol, EG from ethylene, heat, and electricity, were LEGENDSugarcane simulated in Aspen Plus® v10. The biorefinery system will be analyzed both considering a greenfield project as being a retrofitting of an existing ethanol distillery. The products (MEG and electricity) were selected in this study because both can be obtained on a large scale through well -established technologies. The relevance and applications of electricity are straightforward. MEG can be copolymerized with terephthalic acid to produce PET, which is commonly used to produce plastic bottles and textile fibers. Major soft drink companies have introduced PET bottles containing 100% renewable MEG, thereby establishing a specific market for this biochemical (JONG et al., 2011) . Brazil is selected due to its high availability of biomass (especially sugarcane), s trong agricultural sector, and consolidated bioethanol industry (WELFLE, The price of sugarcane is a function of the average transport distance ( TD) between the cultivation area and the industrial plant, considering a fixed term related to cutting and transshipment. Therefore, the model that describes the price of cane ( PC) considering the harvesting, transshipment, and transport (C CT) and the land use for sugarcane crop is calculated in Equation 9 (JONKER et al., 2015) .

The OSBL is composed by the cogeneration unit and storage area , which were considered as parts of the CAPEX. However, the other required utilities (water supply, effluent treatment, etc) were considered in the OPEX as variable costs by assuming that they are provided by specialized companies.

Ethanol is converted into ethylene in the reaction area, with 95 –99 mol% selectivity and 98 –99 mol% conversion. Ethanol dehy dration is promoted by alumina -or silica -alumina -based catalysts at 300 –500 °C and 1 –10 atm for an ethanol concentration of approximately 95 wt%. Catalyst regeneration is required because of coke deposition (GOBE et al., 2018) . Water is the main byproduct of the reaction and is removed along with unreacted ethanol in the recovery area to produce chemical -grade ethylene. CO 2, another major byproduct, is removed by scrubbing with soda, and cryogenic distillation removes the remaining impurities, such as carbon monoxide, to obtain polymer -grade ethylene.", "Following the proposed methodology pro cess, assumptions are made in accordance to consulted references. Those assumptions are summarized bellow (Table 6). They are the basis for the process description that go along with the Process Flow Diagrams (Figure 7; Figure 9; Figure 11).", "Table 6.

The pressurized ethanol stream (102) is sent to the economizer (E -101), where the ethanol is partially vaporized. Subsequently, ethanol goes to an evaporator (E-102) and then to an integrator (E -103), where part of the energy from the raw ethylene stream (121) is transferred to the vaporized ethanol stream (104). After vaporization and energy integration, the ethanol stream that reaches the reactor zone (105) is divided into four streams and sent to the furnaces. A medium vapor stream at 9 bar (124) is added to the first stream of vaporized ethanol (106), in a ratio of approximately 2.6. This dilution aims to reduce coke deposition and, consequently, to slow down the reactors' catalytic deactivation.", "Upon reaching the first oven (E -104), the diluted ethanol stream (107) has its temperature raised to 475 ℃, which is the midpoint of the optimal temperature range from 450 to 500 ℃ for catalytic dehydration of ethanol. Upon leaving the oven, the ethanol stream (108) is sent to the first reactor (R -101).", "As a result of the first reactor (R -101), several compone nts are formed, among them: ethylene, hydrogen, ethyl ether, acetaldehyde, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, butene, ethane, propanol, and propene. Ethanol conversion is around 98 -99%. Despite many components, ethylene's production selectivity may vary betw een 95 to 99% on a molar basis. Thus, the ethylene -forming stream (109) receives a charge of fresh ethanol (110) from the division of the vaporized ethanol stream (105). This mixture is sent to the oven (E -105) to reach a temperature of 475 ℃ before enteri ng the second reactor (R -102). The same procedure is repeated until the outlet of the fourth reactor Finally, the raw ethylene stream (120) is obtained, which goes to the heat exchangers (E-101 and E -103) to integrate the plant energetically. At t he end of the reaction section, 98 to 99.9% of ethanol is converted.

The first stream corresponds to a portion of the knock -out vessel's condensate stream (217), while the other is a stream of process water (204), which acts as a make - up stream in the system. The combination of these s treams results in the column recirculation stream (205) driven by a pump (P -201) and later divided into two streams. The first of these is the system purge stream (207) which, in sequence, goes to the flash vessel (V -202), generating two effluent streams, one of condensate (209) and the other of non -condensing (207).

Then, the ethylene is sent to a washing tower with soda (V -207) to remove traces of CO2 formed in the reacti on section (Area 100). CO2 is a polymer -grade ethylene contaminant and should be reduced to concentrations below five ppm. Thus, the soda stream (235) is sent to a pump (P -202) and, subsequently, to the top of the washer (V - 207). In this step, equilibrium reactions consume CO2 and provide the formation of NaHCO3, which is removed by the condensate stream (237). In this way, the top stream (238) is cooled by a heat exchanger (E -206) and sent to a molecular sieve (V - 208), which aims to remove the residual wat er and ethanol content. Finally, the condensate streams generated in these steps (233, 237, and 240) are discarded as effluent (242), and the chemical -grade ethylene stream (243) is generated.

The refrigerated stream (302) is then sent to an expansion valve (PV - 301), whose function is to adjust the stream to the column's operating press ure. The cryogenic column's first objective is to remove the rest of the chemical -grade ethylene's impurities. In this way, heavy impurities such as propene, butene, acetaldehyde, and ethane are removed from the column's bottom (306). The stream is cooled with ethylene at the column top in a partial condenser (E -303) to a temperature of -60 ℃. In the condensate tank (V -301), the light stream (309), composed of hydrogen, methane, and CO, is removed from the system.

After defibrillation, the cane is ready to proceed to the mill. The mill consists of two rolls, which apply pressure to the chopped and shredded cane.

This reaction between phosphoric acid and the base, also known as liming, generates a material that acts on the c oagulation and flocculation of impurities present in the broth. The pH is adjusted to the neutrality range to avoid glucose degradation since it undergoes inversion in an acid medium. The broth is heated until boiling (E -201) and then passes through a flas h (V-201); this operation promotes the broth's pasteurization and clarifies the broth, reducing the number of reagents required the coagulation and flocculation stages.

Five shifts were considered for the calculation of the labor costs composing the OPEX of the integrated complex, assuming 25 operators and eight supervisors per shift. 4.2 Incorporating Scale and Seasonality in the Economic Modeling In Brazil, the sugarcane harvest season varies according to the region considered. In general, it lasts for approximately five months in the Northeast, six months in São Paulo and Paraná, and up to eight months in the South -central region. Therefore, biorefineries usually deal with raw material seasonality. In this study, the ethylene and EG units were designed to operate at 8,000 h/yr. The ethanol facility can operate at 3,960 h/yr in the Northea st region and at 5,280 h/yr in the expansion South -central region. Moreover, the utilization factor adopted for the São Paulo and Paraná regions was 4,620 h/yr (PECEGE, 2020) . This capacity mismatch was solved by designing a storage park and including it in the CAPEX of the biorefinery. The higher the distillery utilization factor, the lower its CAPEX due to the smaller ethanol storage park and lower no minal capacity. Finally, the capacities of the biorefinery system were evaluated for each location from an integrated perspective (sugarcane to MEG) by developing the integrated PFS for each assessed scenario.", "The investment costs of a (bio)chemical proces s facility are highly related to its capacity, and the relationship between these variables is usually nonlinear. As stated by the International Energy Agency (DE JONG et al., 2020) , the expected growth in biochemical production capacity has not yet been achieved because the economies of scales for fossil -based plant capacities are different from those fo r bio -based plant capacities. Hence, to evaluate the economy of scale of the facility, the general methodology was applied for eight different capacities of bio -ethylene production: 200, 260, 340, 440, 570, 740, 960, and 1255 KTPA. These capacities were th e reference for the biorefinery system capacity, implying that the simulations defined the distillery and MEG dimensions and production.", "Thus, for each capacity, an associated final CAPEX and total fixed capital were generated. The correlation between CAPE X and capacity were determined by estimating the investiment costs for all the aforementionated capacities as represented in the Equation 15.

Nevertheless, the PFS described in methodology section was designed to deliver a comprehensive cash flow analysis based on the CAPEX and OPEX estimates for each process or a system of processes. Herein, the effects of scale and seasonality in the MSP were investigated and compared with the average market price for each product. Thus, the economy of scale for the bioproduct was verified based on its price , which vary with the capacity according to Equation 16.", "Equation 16 The CAPEX, OPEX, and investment analyses were performed as described for the bio-ethylene unit considering the utilization factor for each evaluated region. The capacity that should be applied to the ethylene production unit was assessed, so that the disti llery could produce ethanol required for one year of ethylene production. Therefore, the operational factor gap associated with the seasonality of sugarcane was filled by a storage facility, whose CAPEX was calculated according to Equation 17, which was modified into a function of the ethanol volume capacity storage per year: Equation 17 𝐶𝐴𝑃𝐸𝑋 𝐸𝑇𝐻𝐴𝑁𝑂𝐿 𝑆𝑇𝑂𝑅𝐴𝐺𝐸 =𝑎.𝑉𝐸𝑇𝐻𝐴𝑁 𝑂𝐿 𝑆𝑇𝑂𝑅𝐴𝐺𝐸𝑛 (17) where V ETHANOL STORAGE is the annual storage of ethanol (m3/yr), which is calculated according to the annual capacity of ethanol, the density of ethanol (ρ ETHANOL ), and the hours of operation of the biorefinery (OP Bio) and distillery (OP Dist).

Equation 19 to Equation 25 were obtained from the regression of the simulation points plotted in Figure 32. Equation 25 is an ethanol storage correlation developed to deal with the seasonality. These equations can be considered as an original contribution to the literature on the techno -economi c assessment of biorefineries and can serve as a tool to support stakeholders and policymakers. From these, two important economic parameters (CAPEX and MSP) can be rapidly obtained for a wide range of bio - ethylene, ethanol, and MEG production scales. Addi tionally, the cogeneration surface response model from 4.1.4 completed the package of biorefinery building blocks.

For all cases, the sugarcane consumption ranged from 5.1 to 11.2 million tonnes per annum (MTPA), acco unting for 0.8% to 1.8% of the sugarcane production in Brazil during the 2018/2019 harvest season. Nevertheless, the higher biorefinery capacity (440 KTPA) represents approximately 25% of the sugarcane production in the Northeast region of Brazil during th e 2018/2019 season. This capacity surpassed that of the largest Brazilian mill , whose capacity is 10.5 MTPA (NOVACANA, 2022) .

For example, if sugarcane is available for only six months per year with no storage availability, the distillery must have the capacity to process all the raw material on receipt and would be shut down during the off -season. The downstream unit s (in this case, the bio -ethylene and bio -MEG production) could be designed to operate under two scenarios: (i) throughout the year, if an ethanol storage park is provided, or (ii) only when the distillery is operating. Scenario (ii) would have half of the operational factor of Scenario (i), and probably a higher CAPEX and MSP. However, the storage area of Scenario (i) would negatively affect its economic performance.", "Table 18 summarizes the primary economic outcomes of each evaluated scenario, after considering the seasonality effects. The lowest MSP was obtained in the South - central region with the highest capacity. However, it was only 2% lower than that for the same capacity in the São Paulo region and was 5.5% lower than that of the same capacity in the Northeast region. The more prominent the distillery utilization factor, the lower the electricity revenues, which implies that the MSP marginal gain decreases with t he distillery utilization factor. Notably, these results are based on conservative assumptions on the internal discount rate and the green field CAPEX. Thus, the scale had a substantial effect on MSP.", "Table 18: Economic results by region for cases 1 and 2.

This would imply in a trade strategy of the Brazilian chemical industry a iming at reaching international markets with a green chemical commodity. The analysis of this strategy is out of the scope of this thesis . Thus, Case 2 was disregarded and only Case 1 (200 KTPA bio - ethylene feed) projects for each region were evaluated for the retrofitting scenario (considering the exclusion of the distillery CAPEX from the investment).

However, the higher bio - MEG production (Case 2) accounted for less than 10% of the global trade in 2015 (10 – 15 MTPA (TRADEMAP, 2020) . Thus, by using the proposed bi orefinery, Brazil should become a relevant bio -MEG supplier with minor technological challenges.

Autohydrolysis reactor R -101, mixer M -101, and anaerobic digester R-102 were simulated using the RStoic block to represent, respectively, the separation of aqueous extract from solid seaweed, the precipitation of alginate via CaCl 2 solution, and the formation of biogas, using yield data reported by Flórez -Fernández et a l. (2021) as input parameters. The addition of HCl or NaOH solutions in the anaerobic digestion reactor was not simulated since it would be challenging to estimate factors such as the pH of the reaction medium in the simulation software , without knowing th e compositions of seaweed biomass and anaerobic sludge. A series of Aspen Plus design specifications and calculator functions were used to determine the flowrates of the other inlet streams (water for autohydrolysis and anaerobic digester, CaCl 2, Na 2S·9H 2O, Na 2CO 3, and sludge), based on component ratios and concentration parameters reported by Flórez -Fernández et al. (2021) . Figur e 40 shows the PSD developed.", "Figur e 40: Marine biorefinery PSD.", "5.2 Biorefinery economic model", "The simulation results were used for equipment mapping, sizing, and costing using Aspen Process Economic Analyzer (PEA) V11. Seaweed washing (W -101), seaweed pressing (P -101), autohydrolysis vacuum filter (F -101), and alginate centrifuge (C -101) were designed, respectively, using the following PEA equipment: atmospheric tray dryer, pressure leaf -wet filter, rotary disk filter, and high -speed disk centrifuge. The heat exchanger HX -101 was considered a fixed -tube (floating head, u -tube exchanger). The mixer M -101 was sized as an agitated tank with a hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 20 minutes for precipitation of calcium alginate. Lyophil izers L -101 and L-102 were specified as costed equipment, estimating the total number of lyophilizers and purchase costs for each project capacity based on technical specifications and pricing data from manufacturers (Xinyang, 2021). Surge tanks for both l yophilizers were also included in Aspen PEA to ensure the continuous operation of the biorefinery. These tanks were sized as vertical process vessels with HRT's equal to their respective lyophilizer's batch time plus 20% to account for equipment loading an d offloading. Autohydrolysis reactor R -101 was sized as an agitated, tank -enclosed, jacketed reactor with an HRT of 20 minutes (Flórez -Fernández et al., 2021). R -102 is considered a covered lagoon system anaerobic digester and was sized using an average co st of 6,100 USD/kW, which also entails equipment costs associated with the generator G - 101 used for electricity production. Krich et al. (2005) estimated this average cost per kilowatt, analyzing the capital costs of 18 digesters in the United States (KRICH et al., 2005) . Based on the Chemical Engineering Cost Index (CEPCI) of 2005 (when the report was published) equal to 468,2 and 2020's CEPCI of 603,1, the anaerobic digester cost was time -adjusted to an average value of 7,858 USD/kW. Electricity generation, in turn, was estimated for each biorefinery capacity by the methane content in biogas (stream 28 in Figure 1(a)), the methane conversion factor of 0,293 kWh/ft3, and the average energy conve rsion efficiency of 28% for anaerobic digester systems (KRICH; AUGENSTEIN, DON BATMALE, 2005) .Data from the same reference report was also used to estimate costs per kilowatt -hour to operate the anaerobic digester and generate electricity.", "In addition to the process equipment described in Section 2 (and illustrated in Figure 39) for the biorefinery process, storage equipment for raw materials, chemical inputs, and products were also included in Aspen PEA to provid e a more accurate estimation of capital costs. This equipment was sized as horizontal process vessels, assuming storage times of 3 days for raw materials and chemical inputs (i.e., seaweed, CaCl 2 solution, Na 2S·9H 2O, Na 2CO 3, and anaerobic sludge) and 7 days for the main product and byproducts (i.e., fucoidan extract, lyophilized sap, calcium alginate, and biomass in the alternative project). These parameters and considerations are used by the software to estimate direct capi tal costs from equipment purchase. The software's costs databases use other factors (e.g., the type of process, plant location, and soil condition) to estimate extra expenditures such as installation, piping, instrumentation, buildings, electrical wiring, painting, and insulation. The project's capital expenditures (CAPEX) and yearly operational expenditures (OPEX) were estimated as described in chapter three and Table 23 shows the complete list of the parameters used to estimate these costs . Capital costs estimated in Aspen PEA on a n US Gulf Coast basis are not adjusted with location factors , since the plant is assumed to be placed on the western coast of the United Sta tes, where S. muticum is reportedly abundant (MILLER; AGUILAR -ROSAS; PEDROCHE, 2011) .

The other products (i.e., sap, calcium alginate, and organic fertilizer in the alternative project) are treated as byproducts and included as additional revenue in the cash flow analysis. For the base project, electricity generated via biogas from anaerobic digestion is also included as a byproduct to consider utility consumption reduction in this biorefinery design. Also, t he project's net present value (NPV) is evaluated accordin g to the developed methodology.", "This bioref inery system have been analized for both the base project (biomass undergoes anaerobic digestion for producing biogas and generating electricity) and the alternative project (in which biomass is sold as organic fertilizer). In addition to the seaweed feedstock, both projects employ CaCl 2 for alg inate precipitation, process water for seaweed washing and autohydrolysis, low -pressure steam in reactor R -101, chilled water in cooler HX -101, and electricity for equipment operation. Moreover, costs related to the treatment of seaweed washing water befor e its reuse must also be considered. As previously mentioned, electricity generated from biogas is accounted as a byproduct in the base project; however, the anaerobic digester requires additional process water, Na 2S·9H 2O, Na 2CO 3, and anaerobic sludge inpu ts, as well as costs associated with operating the digester and generating electricity. As discussed in the methodology raw materials, chemical inputs, and utilities comprise a fraction of the variable cost of the project OPEX. In contrast, the byproducts influence yearly expenditures by being accounted as additional revenue. Their prices and costs were estimated via international trade databases, techno -scientific literature, and specialized companies' price databases, as shown in Table 24.

Therefore, these results can be used to evaluate the economies of scale for both the project costs and the main product's selling price. The math correlations between CAPEX and MSP with the plant capacity can be evaluated using Equation 15 and Equation 16 respectively.", "5.3 Results and Discussion", "5.3.1 Cash Flow Analysis", "Using the proposed methodology, it i s possible to generate the detailed CAPEX for both the base and alternative projects’ ISBL and OSBL according to each seaweed feedstock as presented in the Table 25.", "Table 25: Detailed CAPEX (in USD) and OPEX (in million USD/year) for the base project (BP) and alternative project (AP) of the bioref inery process for different seaweed feedstock capacities.", "Seaweed feedstock Fucoidan extract BP AP BP AP BP AP BP AP BP AP BP AP CAPEX (in USD) Total direct field Construction Total indirect field Engineering and Table S2 (continue) Total non -field Project costs for CAPEX OPEX (in million USD/year) Raw materials Chemical inputs and utilities Labor costs Supply and maintenance costs Table S2 (continue) Maintenance and Additional fixed costs Administrative Manufacturing Indirect fixed costs Distribution and Research and Byproducts Generated Byproducts", "Aspen PEA results demonstrate that equipment costs are 3.4 to 21.2% lower in the alternative project due to the absence of anaerobic digestion. In the 50 and 100 kg/h scenarios, the CAPEX and total capital costs are higher for the alternative project due to additional expen ditures, such as spare parts, piping, and instrumentals. These aspects are more prominent for the organic fertilizer storage vessel than for the anaerobic digester and the electricity generator, at least for low seaweed feedstock capacity. Nevertheless, fr om the 200 kg/h scenario onward, the alternative project presents 1.6 to 12.7% lower CAPEX than the base one due to the increased capital costs of the anaerobic digestion section.", "A breakdown of the equipment costs for each project is presented in Figure 41. The anaerobic digester becomes more influent in the cost composition as capacity increases; in contrast, the organic fertilizer storage that replaces the digester i n the alternative project is only responsible for less than 3% of equipment costs in all capacities. In both projects, 26 to 75% of total costs comprise storage equipment, mainly due to the main fucoidan extract product, one of the highest volumetric flowr ates among the biorefinery's process streams. Simulation results were also used to estimate variable costs with raw materials, chemical inputs, utilities, and revenue from byproducts. Meanwhile, CAPEX estimates were used alongside financial engineering heuristics to calculate additional yearly fixed costs.", "Variable costs and byproducts revenue are proportional to the seaweed feedstock for each project since these results are related to the simulation mass balances, which, in turn, are based on the product y ields reported by Flórez -Fernández et al. (2021). For all capacities, variable costs are higher in the base project due to additional expenditures with process water, Na 2S·9H 2O, Na 2CO 3, anaerobic sludge, and operating the digester itself. Overall, the base project OPEX increases with the addition of fixed costs since most of these expenditures are CAPEX -based heuristics, demonstrating the indirect influence of CAPEX estimation in other factors of the economic analysis.", "As demonstrated in Table 25, variable costs and byproducts revenue are directly proportional to the production capacity since they are related to the process -specific technical coefficients. Nevertheless, variable costs represent less than 40% of operational expenditures in both proce ss configurations. Yearly costs are mostly comprised of labor costs, which are the same in all production capacities, as well as other fixed costs based on project CAPEX which, in turn, do not increase linearly with production capacity due to economies of scale.", "Conversely, byproducts revenue is higher in the alternative project due to selling the residual seaweed biomass as organic fertilizer. In comparison, electricity savings from anaerobic digestion range from 5,000 to 152,000 $/year in the base project , while additional revenue from selling biomass as fertilizer in the alternative project ranges", "Figure 41: Equipment costs breakdown for each project and seaweed feedstock capacity: (a) Base project; (b) Alternative project. Main equipment: press P -101, autohydrolysis reactor R -101, cooler HX - 101, filter F -101, mixer M -101 and centrifuge C -101; Secondary equipment: seaweed washer W -101, lyophilizers L -101 and L -101 and their surge tanks; Anaerobic digestion: digester R -102 and generator G-101; Fertilizer storage: storage vessel for biomass sold as fertilizer; Storage equipment: storage vessels fo r raw materials and products.", "Although anaerobic digestion is a valid method for increasing the economic performance of biochemical processes, improving the project's sustainability, results demonstrate that the savings from electricity generation are not enough to compensate for the operational costs from anaerobic digestion. These conclusions are consistent with the experimental evidence regarding the low methane potential of S. muticum , even with the increase in methane production due to pressing and aut ohydrolysis (Flórez -Fernández et al., 2021). However, it is worthy to mention that despite the electricity generation provide a more pauper economic result it has a guaranteed market while the fertilizer option requires a more careful marketing strategy to assure the better projected economic result.", "Table 26 presents the results for the minimum selling price of fucoidan extract for each project, al ongside a summary of their respective CAPEX and OPEX results. Table 26: Cash flow analysis results considering different seaweed feedstock for both the base and alternative projects.", "Fucoidan extract capacity Base project Alternative project According to the seaweed feedstock, the cash flow analysis demonstrated that the fucoidan extract MSP decreases from 663.46 to 28.56 $/t in the base project. In comparison, in the alternative project, the MSP decreases from 658.75 to 12.75 $/t. In both pro jects, the MSP is inversely proportional to the biorefinery's capacity, showing a non -linear relationship between plant capacity and capital and operational expenditures, demonstrating the importance of evaluating multiple scenarios in the economic analysi s of chemical processes. Although scale factors for industrial processes are usually around 0.60, the Sargassum muticum process contains low throughput equipment such as lyophilizers, filters and centrifuges that were sized at their minimum dimensions in A spen PEA and, therefore, have low or no cost variation with production capacity. This explains the low scale factors obtained for both process configurations in comparison with values usually considered in CAPEX estimates for scale -up operations.", "As previo usly expressed in Equation 8, the minimum selling price can be decomposed into fractions from variable and fixed costs, return on investment, taxes, and credits from byproducts revenue and depreciation. Figure 42 presents the cost composition of each project MSP according to the seaweed feedstock capacity and the revenue of each project per tonne of fucoidan extract produced.", "Figure 42: Minimum selling price (MSP) composition and specific credits behavior of the fucoidan extract with each feedstock capacity for (a) Base project; (b) Alternative project. Their respective variable costs fraction of the MSP is constant for all capacities in both projects because the consumption of raw materials, chemical inputs, and utilities are proportional to the fucoidan extract production. Moreover, variable costs comprise only 1.9 to 19.5% of the MSP in the base project and 1.3 to 15.2% in the alternative one. Corporate taxes comprise 33 to 37% of the MSP in both projects. Meanwhile, fixed costs and ROI are responsible for up to 85.3% of the MSP at the lowest capacity, reducing their contribution to 71.1% at the highest seaweed feedstock capacity. Since ROI is directly related to capital costs and most fixed costs are CAPEX -based metrics, these results again demonstrate the biorefinery's economies of scale and the non - linear relationship between production capacity and ca pital expenditures. In addition, the higher specific credits for the alternative project compared to the base one is consistent with its increase in byproducts revenue, further justifying its reduced results for MSP compared to the base design.", "The CAPEX a nd MSP in each project for different seaweed feedstock capacities were used as simulation data points to obtain cost curves. The CAPEX (in 106 $, i.e., M$) and the MSP (in $/t) correlations obtained for the base project (BP) are expressed respectively in Equation 26 and Equation 27. The same correlations for the alternative project (AP) are expressed in Equation 28 and Equation 29, respectively. CAPEX equations are presented in terms of fucoidan extract production capacity in kt/year and for MSP is US Dollars per tonne. The CAPEX and MSP curves are illustrated in the Figure 43.", "Equation 26 Equation 27 Equation 28 Equation 29 CAPEX curves for both projects have similar values at lower feedstocks. The reduction in capital costs for the alternative project becomes increasingly evident from feedstock values around 400 kg /h onward ( Figure 43). Models for both projects provided a reasonable adjustment to the simulation data results considered for the MSP curve. As expected, the highest MSP value for the fucoidan extract is attained at the lowest feedstock capacity, followed by a sharp reduction (until capacities around 400 kg/h). MSP kept virtually constant for capacities above 800 kg/h .", "Figure 43: Capacity curves for the base and alternative projects: (a) CAPEX; (b) fucoidan extract MSP; (c) fucoidan extract MSP reduction in the alternative project compared to the base one. Points represent simulation results, and curves are model adjustments. For a better comparison of the cash flow analysis results, the relative reduction of the MSP in the alternative project compared to the base one as a function of the seaweed feedstock capacity is available alongside a linear fit of the same results. The mathematical model for the percentual reduction of the MSP (MSPred.) according to the seaweed feedstock (in kg/h) is expressed in Equation 30.", "Equation 30 Once again, the model presented an excellent adjustment (R2 = 0.998) to the simulation data results, indicating a linear reduction of the fucoidan extract's MSP directly proportional to the biorefinery's capacity. Moreover, this mathematical model presents itself as a particularly convenient tool for decision -maki ng regarding scale -up projects. Given the base design's MSP for a specific seaweed feedstock, it is possible to directly estimate the alternative project's increased economic benefits at a higher biorefinery capacity.", "It should be emphasized that neither t he laboratory -scale process presented by Flórez - Fernández et al. (2021) nor the industrial -scale processes presented in this work were designed under layout optimization procedures. Therefore, future works can be performed focusing on process optimization, increasing the biorefinery’s economic performance. Moreover, both project alternatives were evaluated assuming constant seaweed supply. In spite of the fact that S. muticum maintain most of its composition and density steady (PLOUGUERNÉ et al., 2006) , future works should further investigate the seaweed’s seasonality and its potential effects on the availability of the process’ feedstock.", "5.3.2 Risk Analysis", "A risk analysis was also carried out to evaluate the effects of specif ic design parameters on the biorefinery process's NPV. For both projects, the variables chosen for the risk analysis were the total CAPEX, the MARR, and the fucoidan extract selling price. In addition, for the base project, the electricity generated from a naerobic digestion was also included to account for uncertainties associated with methane production from seaweed biomass and the generator's energy conversion efficiency. In contrast, the organic fertilizer selling price was included as a variable for the alternative project to account for possible variations in its composition, directly impacting its economic potential and revenue.", "The uncertainty ranges considered for each variable were as follows: CAPEX from -40 to +70%, fucoidan extract selling price f rom -50 to +50%, MARR from -25 to +50%, generated electricity from -50 to +100%, and organic fertilizer price from -50 to +50%. The risk analysis was carried out for an intermediary value of seaweed feedstock (200 kg/h), and the tornado diagrams for each p roject are illustrated in Figure 44.", "Figure 44: Risk analysis tornado diagrams considering a seaweed feedstock capacity of 200 kg/h for (a) Base project; (b) Alternative project.", "The fucoidan extract selling price is the most influential variable on NPV for both projects, followed by the project CAPEX and the MARR. As previously discussed in this section, the project CAPEX, directly and indirectly, affects the cash flow variables related to the NPV, su ch as return on investment and operational expenditures. Therefore, the base project's higher CAPEX values in most scenarios also increase risks in this design regarding its NPV, and this effect is directly proportional to the seaweed feedstock capacity.", "Electricity generation in the base project provided negligible influence in the risk analysis, further demonstrating that, despite the capital and operational expenditures associated with anaerobic digestion of S. muticum , the seaweed's low methane potentia l makes electricity generation from biogas an economically unattractive opportunity. Conversely, the organic fertilizer price was more influential in the alternative project's analysis, indicating the contribution of this revenue source in the economic per formance of the alternative biorefinery design. This effect is also corroborated by the reduced influence of the fucoidan extract selling price in the risk analysis compared to the base project. The organic fertilizer provides a larger share of the project 's total revenue, reducing the main product's selling price. The risk analysis variables were also combined in a total of 400 Monte Carlo simulations for each project. Figure 45 illustrates the cumulative distribution functions for a seaweed feedstock of 200 kg/h. For this capacity, only 35.25% of simulated scenarios provide positive NPVs in the base project, decreasing to 34.75% in the alternative project. Median NPV v alues for the base and the alternative projects were evaluated at -2.60 and 2.58 M$, respectively. These elevated risks are mainly associated with possible variations in the main product's selling price (the biorefinery's primary source of revenue) and the CAPEX estimate's uncertainties. The reduced risk of the base project is associated with the electricity generation, which is a variable with a lower influence on NPV than the organic fertilizer selling price in the alternative project. Nevertheless, the i ncreased risk associated with byproducts revenue in the alternative project is compensated by the lower risk in this design related to the main product's selling price, which explains the similar results between both projects.", "Figure 45: Risk analysis distribution functions (Monte Carlo simulations) for (a) Base project; (b) Alternative project, considering a seaweed feedstock of 200 kg/h.

The proposed alternative renewable process route, however, considered a high TRL process technology where the problem is how t o be competitive in a stablished market , given scale and seasonality drawbacks . The second case study evaluated the production of a new high value product through a still low TRL r oute and without a stablished market . Therefore, it tested the methodology and assessed a case study completely different. In this case, the main questions were how to develop the technology , scaling up it, while build up the market .", "The methodology proved to be useful to evaluat e both high and low TRL process es technologies and for diferent kind of products.

As demonstrated in case study one, this ap proach was capa ble to provide result with a high degree of accuracy even more than what is usually accepted for a conceptual study phase. The demonstrated accuracy obtained in the case study provide d the confidence to apply this methodology for low TRL technology analysis being a powerful tool to guide the technology delevopment in a more strategical approach.", "Findings corroborate for both case studies that s cale is one of the main variables that must me addressed in the biore fineries design . This is valid both for stablished markets where the renewable product must be competitive with existing fossil -based products and for new products that must have its market developed . Actually, strategies to coordinate technology and market development can be defined using th e kind of studies provided in the present thesis .", "Seasonality is also an other central issue that is even less explored than scale. Seaso nality varies a lot between different raw materials and can fluctuate for the same culture when cultivated in distinct regions.", "Scale and seasonality represent important constraints for biorefineries feasibility. Alongside measuring and understanding their impacts, it is imperative to develop public policies oriented to valuate and incorporate environmental and social benefits from using biomasses as renewable feedstocks in the biorefineries facilities. Greenhouse gases emissions reduction is a standout positive impact, which can compensate scale and seasonality disadvantages.", "Therefore, t he process design and simulation approach adopted in this thesis proved to be efficient providing detailed information to evaluate scale, seasonality and product portfolio strateg ies considering the business perspecti ve. By embracing this method, it was possible to correlate technical variables to economic feasibility criteria s what allowed support ing strategic and operational decisions since the earliest stages of a technology development.", "However, the availability o f physical chemical data of renewable raw materials is pauper . As demonstrated in the literature review, most of the process simulation works still using NREL data even for different types of biomasses that were analyzed in their studies . Also, it would be useful to understand for different raw materials if its composition and properties can vary significantly along the season and between seasons . Therefore, i t would be valuable to increase studies dedicated to improve the data on physical chemical properties for a wider range of potential raw materials . Case study one presented a detailed techno -economic analysis of a biorefinery system designed to produce bio -MEG and electricity from sugarcane. Each conversion process was modeled on the Aspen Plus® platform to generate inputs for economic assessments. Advanced process technologies were chosen to compose the biorefinery, minimize risks and focus on the main target, and understand the economies of scale and seasonality effects for th e stand -alone processes and the integrated biorefinery. This methodology could be a valuable tool and can be used to perform evaluations considering different raw materials, conversion technologies, and product portfolios.", "The results for the economy of sc ale showed a reduction in MSP when the bio -ethylene process was scaled from 200 kTPA, a typical commercial capacity in Brazil, to approximately 440 kTPA. However, a higher capacity was associated with logistical challenges for the raw material supply. Neve rtheless, this scale is an order of magnitude lower than that of modern fossil -based ethylene facilities. Logistical challenges and opportunities can be thus explored in future works , for example . Moreover, a biorefinery in the Northeast region to produce bio-MEG could be justified despite the seasonality drawback due to the strategic location closer to the European and North American markets. Efficient incentive policies could boost this region to become a major supplier for a new bioeconomy.", "The inclusion of storage parks alongside biorefinery systems revealed to be an effective strategy for managing raw material seasonality. The lower the raw material availability throughout the year (high seasonality), the higher the MSP of bio -MEG. However, as the energy balance is only sensitive to seasonality, the higher the distillery operational factor, the lower the electricity income, which indicated that the contribution of seasonality to the evaluated biorefinery was limited.", "The major conclusion drawn in this first study was that, for all cases run, only a combination of low IRR and diminished sugarcane prices would make the bio -MEG competitive. Hence, such investment had a higher level of risk unless the market paid the differential price associated wit h the bio -MEG feedstock.", "The results of this case study were obtained from a conservative perspective relying on the retrofitting of an existing distillery, conventional technologies, low product diversification, absence of carbon taxes, and any incentive policies. These limitations are also recommendations for future research. CAPEX reduction might be achieved by improving the mass and energy integration between the processes (ethanol, bio - ethylene, and MEG). Additionally, the ethanol could be fed at lowe r concentrations during the dehydration process, reducing the distillery CAPEX.", "However, as demonstrated through the tornado risk analyses, only CAPEX reduction would be inadequate to produce a positive NPV if the biorefinery is remunerated at fossil -based MEG price. Thus, future research should investigate the impact of product diversification (e.g., determine valuable applications for CO 2, straw, and vinasse), carbon market, and other possible incentive policies for boosting the biorefinery competitivenes s. A strongly recommended future research should deal with the possibility to use CO 2 as raw material for another process (such as methanol production, for ex ample) in other to maximize the bio -MEG GHG reduction considering a scenario where carbon markets are well established.", "Finally, raw material seasonality considerably affected the bio -MEG MSP. It decreased by 80 USD/t when the project was conceptualized from the Northeast to the South - central region. As mentioned before, s uch a difference might be com pensated by the advantage of a northeastern location, which would be closer to the United States and European markets. The region might become a biomaterial exporter, comprising a revitalization strategy for the sugarcane industry in the Northeast region o f Brazil. Application of the methodology and biorefinery system presented in this study to propose a policy to incentivize bio -MEG production in the Northeast region would be an interesting future study , including studies on regional income and labor gener ation . Eventhough, the revenues with electricity production due the integraly bagasse burning reached 52 million dollars per year in one of the scenarios evaluated in the case study one, the exploitation of the second -generation sugars to increase ethanol production and/or produce high add value biochemicals should be evaluated in further studies , as biomass hydrolysis technologies are becoming more competitive. The energy balance problem could be addressed by using the lignin and straw from the field. Interesting, finding an optimal mix between ethanol to fuel and ethanol to chemicals is an exercise to be performed.", "The second case study proposed a continuous industrial scale biorefinery process to valorize the invasive Sargassum muticum seaweed. Results suggest that anaerobic digestion is less economically attractive for the biorefinery process than selling the residual seaweed biomass as organic fertilizer, primarily du e to the low methane conversion potential of S. muticum . Nonetheless, a comprehensive risk analysis shows similar results for both evaluated cases , mainly due to the negligible influence of electricity generation due to anaerobic digestion and organic fert ilizer selling prices on economic attractiveness. Also, electricity has a captive market while fertilizer would demand a stronger sales effort what is important to highlight .", "This study present ed a valuable tool for providing outcomes about the scale -up of a Sargassum muticum biorefinery project. Albeit fucoidan has not a stablished market and therefore the price is not well defined this case study indicates that even for the lowest scales (less than 50kg/h) the minimum selling price obtained is lower than 300 EUR/kg , which is the price considered by X. Zhang and M. Thomsen (2021) for evaluating fucoidan production from three diferent types os seaweeds. Using this price, these authors found Net Present Values between 186 and 453 million Euros depending on the seaweed processed ( Laminaria digitata, Fucus vesiculosus, and Saccharina latissima ), considering a scale of 900 to nnes of seaweed dry matter per year (ZHANG; THOMSEN, 2021) . Considering this capacity, the MSP calculated by the model developed in case study two is around 300 dollars per to nne, what is orders of magnitude lower indicating that depending on the market size the lowest capacity considere d in this thesis could justify an industrial facility.", "Thus, the second case study developed in this thesis fills and important gap in the scientific literature as of today. Indeed , only a few economic and environmental assessment studies have been conducted in the context of seaweed biorefinery and so far, no assessment studies have performed process modelling of S. muticum biorefinery systems featuring the extraction of high -value biomolecules and provided perspectives on the economic feasibility and environmental sustainability of such novel systems.", "Considering that some sugarcane facilities in the Brazilian northeast are on the coast, it could be an interesting case study to explore the potential to integrate a marine biorefinery to a su garcane one and test the usage of biofertilyzers in the sugarcane production leaving more space to explore the vinase for other usage . This integration can alo contribute for diversifying even more the product portfolio enhancing the combination of high scale and high added value products.", "Finally , it is worthy to mention that the methodology developed and presented in this thesis as well as both case studies , inspired the deployment of an all process and economic engineering area in the applied research institute where this work was developed . This has also generated several studies for private companies and universities helping making decision both for business and research purposes."]}

INTRODUCTION", "Several firms are publishing a sustainability reporting (SR). Their main objective is to inform stakeholders about the level of sustainability of their businesses, enabling the stakeholders to make better decisions (Cubilla -Montilla et al., 2019) . They disclose information about their business practices related to the ethical policies, social, environmental, and financial performance. Overall, SR has been playing an important role in how firms have bee n understanding sustainability (Higgins & Coffey, 2016) .", "According to a KPMG survey (2020 ) of SR, there has be en a growth in the global sustainability reporting rate since 1993. In 2020, 80% of the survey respondents (sample of 5,200 worldwide firms) reported sustainability. The survey also mentioned that the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) remains the main glob al standard for sustainability reporting, this framework was used by approximately two -thirds of the sample. Therefore, SR has been already a common practice in the business world. The GRI framework supports firms to implement the social, environment and f inancial performances in their reports through a list of dimensions and metrics and providing principles and methods to be followed in the development of the SR (GRI, 2021) . The SR has two main objectives: to demonstrate the state of an firm’s performance a nd to communicate the firm’s initiatives and progress towards sustainability to stakeholders (Lozano, 2012) . Hence, GRI helps to achieve these goals. This increase of SR in the market has also impacted the scientific academy. SR is largely voluntary, and many researchers want to find out about the reasons firms engage in this initiative, as a result, reporting research is a trend. Even though there is a lot of research in this field, the theoretical debate has not come to a conclusion about the motives (Thijssens et al., 2016) . The literature also points out critical issues regarding SR. There is a disconnection between the information disclosed and the sustainability reality of firms (Boiral, 2013) . Boiral, (2013) observed non -conformities with GRI principles in reports that were certified with high quality and that were following GRI guidelines. Thus, even in GRI reports, the information disclosed does not seem to fully comply with the requirements and protocols o f the framework. This lack of reliability reinforces the association of SR with decoupling and as a marketing tool with the purpose of improving the firm’ image. Therefore, in order to understand the outcome of the SR, it is important to analyze their deve lopment and its integration with sustainability management.", "Furthermore, stakeholders are demanding firms’ information disclosed, not only about their own operation, but also about their supply chain. According to Bové & Swartz (2016) , a common consumer product has more than 80% of the greenhouse gas emissions related to their supply chain and more than 90% is related to air, land, water, biodiversity and geological resources impacts from their supply chain. Additionally, the GRI guid elines point out, in some dimensions, that negative environmental impacts in the supply chain need actions to be taken by the firm. They recommend, for example, that firm discloses about the number of suppliers, subject to environmental impact assessment a nd the significance of their impact to the environment. This same logic applies to human rights, labor practices, negative impact on society and so forth (GRI, 2021) . Thus, supply chain disclosure is part of the GRI framework. Instead of focusing on what f actors influence SR, which several studies have already focused on (Thijssens et al., 2016) , this research concentrates on how SR is operationalize internally and externally (suppliers). In addition, this study focus es on firms in a highly regulated sector that imposes mandatory compliance with the GRI standards, which ought to reflect higher mat urity and integration in SR. Our sample is composed of large firms which operation within a complex ecosystem, dialoguing with many firms in the market and outside it, therefore, effective integration of sustainability to operate their SR is essential. We have collected data from semi -structured interviews with professionals from the Brazilian electric sector, which is considered a mature sector in disclosing SR. Moreover, an analysis of the firms’ SR was made for the purpose of comparing their SR narrative with strategy and sustainable practices disclosed in their SR to unveil the extent that the cycle of implementing practices and reporting is integrated or decoupled. Also, a post hoc analysis was made based on media news regarding the selected firms. The aim of the post hoc analysis was to investigate if how the firms are portrayed by media is aligned with their own views and SR.", "Hence, this study analyzes the process of implementing SR in Brazilian firms from the Electric Sector, a highly regulated secto r that for long has adopted SR following GRI’s methodology. The objective is to investigate the level of integration between the practices related to sustainability across organizational levels and across functional departments, particularly procurement – to map their approach to the extended supply chain – and ultimately unveil the integration between practices and SR. Therefore, we ask the following research question (RQ):", "To what extent do firms under compliance to GRI standards integrate sustainability practices and sustainability reporting?", "We have considered the framework created by Thijssens et al., (2016) , which analyzes SR through the level of formalization and of integration with the sustainability management. Regarding the level of integration along the supply chain, the concepts of assessmen t and collaboration (Gimenez & Tachizawa, 2012) were used to analyze the relationship between the firm and its suppliers. In addition, the information from the interviews w as compared with the information from the published SR to deepen into details about how firms integrate or decouple their activities.", "The remains of the paper consist of five sections. The second section reviews the literature regarding the SR, the meaning of integrated practices, as used in this study, pointing out the framework used to analyze the data collected from the interviews. Section three presents the methodological framework of the paper, and Section four includes the results of the paper and the discussion. The fifth section presents the main conclusions of the study.", "2. LITERATURE REVIEW", "2.1 Sustainability Reporting", "The World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) defines sustainability reports as public reports to provide internal and external stakeholders a picture of the firm position and activities considering economic, environmental and social dimen sions (WBCSD, 2002) . However, to understand SR is important to study a wider concept: the sustainable development. The sustainable development is defined, according to the Brundtland Commission in 1987, as “the development that meet the needs of the present g eneration without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs” (WCED, 1987) . Consi dering this concept, there has been a debate about the applicability of it to firms and about what corporate sustainability means in practice. Given the high contextual nature of sustainability, many firms adopt a definition that suit their needs (Searcy & Buslovich, 2014) . Brundtland definition has served as a starting point for future definitions. Hence, in this context that the GRI was born.", "The GRI is a nongovernmental firm which was founded in 1997 and had its first guideline launched in 2000. They provided the first global framework for SR. Their main goal is to enable a sustainable future by transparency and open dialogue about the impacts (GRI, 2021) . By providing global standards, GRI allows the comparison between different firms in the same sector, as well as along the years. In 2016, GRI launched GRI sus tainability reporting standard,", "which is the updated guideline providing a set of dimensions and principles to guide the elaboration of the reports. The sustainability standards are continuously revised and updated (GRI, 2021) , with the contribution of diff erent stakeholders. The GRI implementation process by a firm involves the interaction of internal and external actors, which need to dialogue with the firm and to share information and knowledge.", "Regarding the academic field, the SR is the object of sever al studies, plenty of them focusing on understanding the motives for firms to engage in this voluntary initiative. Some studies focus on the pre -conditions of a firm when deciding to develop their SR. Hence, many studies have focused on the relationship be tween external factors influencing the implementation of a SR (Thijssens et al., 2016) , such as corporate and brand reputation, customer satisfaction, regulatory pressure, social legitimacy, stakeholders’ expectations, among others (Lozano, 2015) . Some theories have been used to explain the decision to publish a SR, mainly the legitimacy, stakeholder and signaling theories. Despite the support of such theories to explain the reasons large firms implement SR, external f actors are not enough to exclude other theoretical explanations (Thijssens et al., 2016) . As a result, internal factors should not be overlooked.", "Internal factors can include (but not limited to) leadership, employees shared values, corporate ethics, culture, innovation and so forth (Lozano, 2015) . According to Thijssens et al., 2016 , not only firms factors influence on SR, but also individual characteristics, such as, employee awareness, knowledge, skills and expertise. At the firm level, internal factors are, for example, integration of environmental issues with strategic planning and cross -functional coordination and communication (Pérez et al., 2007) .", "This research focuses on the internal and external factors, however, it has a different point of view, since its main data is from interviews with sustaina bility professionals. Primary research with these professionals reveal insights for operationalizing a sustainability vision which had not been discussed with top leadership (Sroufe, 2017) .", "In important debate in the academic field relates to the voluntary as pect of the SR. According to Brown et al. (2009 ), governments have maintained a distance from the SR movements, considering them voluntary private initiatives. However, there are some exceptions, such as, France and Netherlands. While in France there is a law that requires all listed companies to report their corporate social responsibilities performance in their annual reviews, in Netherlands, the Organization for Economic Co -operation and Development", "(OECD) guidelines for multinational enterprises was included in their legislation, promoting various regulatory and voluntary measures and initiatives rega rding reporting. Even though, the regulations do not specify on GRI guidelines, French companies follow this framework for the SR (Brown et al. , 2009) . Many countries are driven by regulation, typically from government or stock exchange requirements or both, influencing firms to develop their own SR (KPMG, 2020) . According to the KMPG survey, there is a growing momentum worldwide towards mandatory disclosures of some type of information, like climate -related risks and resilience strategies, making reporting level higher as the financial system is greening. Howeve r, the idea of mandatory reporting is contested due to the lack of enforcement mechanisms and the need for credible report assurance practices and standards. Legal requirement could turn reporting into a routinized check -list activity (Brown et al., 2009) .", "Considering this, studying SR in a regulated sector can shed additional light into the problem. Even though the regulation enforces disclo sure and the GRI in particular, it does not point out to what specific information should be disclosed. Thus the decision on the specificities of information disclosure remains a voluntary decision in nature (Rahman et al., 2019) . Also, the regulation is considered an external driver that motivates the development of SR (Lozano, 2015) . Some authors emphasize that voluntary initiatives are insufficient to achieve sustainability accountability since firms disclose strategically, thus, the lack of regulati on facilitates the firms to decouple (Graafland & Smid, 2019) , questioning the sincerity of the SR and producing a mistrust with the stakeholders (Camilleri, 2016) . Some o ther authors emphasize the need of a framework to promote a mandatory comparison between the reports (Hahn & Kühnen, 2013) . Hence, beyond information disclosure, it is par amount to investigate the level of integration between practices and reporting.", "According to Sroufe (2017) , “effective integration of sustainability data with other operating metrics and systems has the potentia l to align diverse aspects of global operations” (p. 317). Considering the SR operation, this research tries to understand the extent that there is integration.", "2.2 Integration between Practices and Reporting", "Integration exists when sustainability is part of the decision -making, value creation, business units, functions and reporting structures within a firm (Garcia et al., 2016) , i.e., when sustainability -related activities are integrated into the processes of acquiring, managing,", "decision -making, measuring and reporting of firm resources used to create value (Sroufe, 2017) . The integration is part of vertical and horizontal alignment of sustainability activities in addition to measurement of performance of several dimensions. The level of integration may vary between firms, where more integrated firms tend to perform better in sustainability aspects than non-integrated firms. Integration should be considered as a process that ev olves with time and efforts. As the sustainability initiatives evolve, they become more complex. Thus, the necessity of sustainability professionals appears. They can influence the vision, strategy, products, processes, and the supply chain integration by improving collaboration and innovation across different functions and businesses. They become agents of change, being capable of integrate, distribute, isolate diversified data about social and environmental activities (Sroufe, 2017) . Also, Sroufe, (2017) mentions the need for primary data collection and engagement with sustainability professionals in academic research. In line with him, Engert & Baumgartner, (2016) argue the need for more research about the integration of sustainability strategic management. Conversely, there is gap in literature investigating primary data about integrated sustainability. One study in this direction (Thijssens et al., 2016) proposes a typology for SR management, based on interviews conducted with lar ge firms following the GRI. This study considers the level of: (1) formalization of SR (2) integration of SR into their daily management. The first dimension differentiates the reports between formal and informal SR management (Thijssens et al., 2016) According to the authors, the formal dimension is characterized by a formal written su stainability strategy, a formal external review committee, a formal management system regarding SR, formal SR orientation/education, a formal SR structure and processes. On the other hand, the informal is the opposite.", "According to the authors, the second dimension differentiates the SR between integrated sustainability and decoupled sustainability (Thijssens et al., 2016) . Regarding the firms with an integrated sustainability management, they consider sustainability in their missions, vision and core business. Some firms can reform the business model, instead of focusing on profit, they are orie nted by a social mission with environmental goals. For these firms the focus is not on the report, instead their main goal is their sustainability performance (Thijssens et al., 2016) . Hence, sustainability is not an addition, but it is part of their daily business processes. Thus, the top management and the operational analysts are involved in s ustainability, contributing to their structure, systems, processes and integration. The board members of the firm are directly involved in sustainability, for instance, engaging in the sustainability strategy of the firm", "(Thijssens et al., 2016) . The board can be responsible to monitor the sustainability performance and even the SR. Also, sustain ability is perceived to be important not only for the top managers directly involved, but also by professionals in other business units. They should share the idea that sustainability is not an additional work to their everyday activities. In this case, th e SR helps to structure and to maintain a management system and to share sustainable values to their employees. So, the SR main goal ought to be to communicate the progress towards sustainability, rather than a marketing tool (Thijssens et al., 2016) .", "In relation to the firms characterized by a decoupled sustainability, their SR can be developed with the support of external consultant hired to produce the report and their concern is with the quality of the report itself, making sure it is following the regulations, compliances, and norms (GRI) correctly (Thijssens et al., 2016) . Their concern is resulted oriented, creating a report to be comparable to their competitors and that is in lin e with quality benchmarks. Thus, it fits in the decoupled SR since it does not prioritize the sustainability integration in the firm even if with a formal management (Thijssens et al., 2016) . Also, it can have the dominance of the communication function in their sustainability sector. In some firms, a formal structure does not mean a actually inv olvement of the senior leadership in sustainability initiatives. The SR is an additional work to employees everyday activities (Thijssens et al., 2016) . Hence, they have a fragile integration level as their SR’s are not aligned with their actual practices. The decoupled firms are influenced by external pressure and use their resources to enact an d evaluate practices that are loosely related to their core goals (Bromley & Powell, 2012) .", "Thus, is vital to understand the integrating and decoupling concepts. Weaver et al., 1999 defines integrated as:", "Integrated structures and policies affect everyday decisions and actions; decisions are made in light of these policies, and people occupying these specialized structures have the confidence o f and regular interaction with other departments and their managers. An integrated structure or policy is likely to be supported by other organizational policies and programs. Thus, managers and employees are held accountable to it, take note of it, and se e it as having a valued role in the organization's operations (p. 540, Weaver et al., 1999) .", "Meanwhile, decoupling is defined as a misalignment between the structures and policies with the firm everyday work, as a result, are not aligned with the firm strategic goals and can be related to demands of external institutions, according to Weaver et al., 1999 : “An easily decoupled structure or policy provides the appearance of conformity to external expectations while making it easy to insulate much of the organization from those expec tations” (p. 541).", "Another author defines decoupling is an association of promising policies and poor implementation of projects and impacts (Graafland & Smid, 2019) . According to Bromley & Powell (2012) , there are two types of decoupling: policy -practice and means -ends decoupling. While the first is related to the relationship between policies and the impleme ntation of programs, the second concerns the (mis) alignment between implementation of programs and their impacts. Decoupling happens when firms fail to align policy and practice over time or when policies are implemented but have a weak relationship to th e “core tasks of an organization” (p3). The means-ends is becoming more common and policy -practice is becoming less (Bromley & Powell, 2012) .", "Regarding the SR, the decoupling occurs, for instance, when firms d o not report all dimensions of the framework and with the ambiguity between the SR and GRI guidelines which can be interpreted “as a way of hiding information and covering up important elements of disclosure” (p. 950), (Cubilla -Montilla et al., 2019) . One example is from a study about China Higher Education Institutions. Their SR discloses only positive information, for instance, the potential hazards to the community from their daily activities was no t mention, only the positive impact (Yalin et al., 2019) . Prior studies in this matter point out that senior managers and board members are reluctant to disclose negative material from their firms, compromis ing the transparency of the reports (Usmani et al., 2020) .", "This research aims to analyze, integration at various levels: across organizational levels and across functional departments, particularly procurement – as this department should be responsible for extending the sustainability practices to the firm’ supply chain. Therefore, two concepts were used: the assessment and collaboration activities. “Assessment includes any activity related to evaluating suppliers (e.g. questionnaires and firm visits), whereas collaboration refers to working directly with suppliers providing them with training, support or other activities” (Gimenez & Tachizawa, 2012, p. 533,). The authors argue that both approaches have a positive i mpact on environmental performance and corporate social responsibility. Thus, firms should adopt both strategies. The assessment is the one step to identify which actions are necessary and the collaboration is needed to improve the sustainability performan ce throughout the firm’ supply chain.", "While analyzing the supply chain of the firms, the decoupling could be an issue. While researching SR of the airline industry, it was found that these firms should disclose significant and potential negative impact on local communities caused by their operations, however such disclosure was less frequent and inconsistent. One firm disclosed that they audited their supply", "chain for conflict minerals, but this is a minor issue when compared with other impacts, such as no ise and pollution on local communities - but the firm was silent on such topics (Ringham & Miles, 2018) . Thus, this research adds the supply chain context to the level of integrated sustainability analys is. In an integrated sustainability context, the firm should have assessment and collaborative activities with their suppliers, which suggests that there is an alignment between the firm sustainability strategy and goals with the supplier’s actions. This s tudy defines integrated sustainability as the everyday actions and decisions aligned with the strategic and operational sustainable business goals. By the same token, it defines decoupled sustainability as the misalignment between actions and decisions wit h the business sustainable strategy and goals. Both concepts were developed considering aspects from the baseline studies of this research , which are: “ Integrated and decoupled corporate social performance : management commitments, external pressures, and c orporate ethics practices” (Weaver et al., 1999) , \"From smoke and mirrors to walking the talk: decoupling in the contemporary world (Bromley & Powell, 2012) , “Extending sustainability to suppliers: a systematic literature review” (Gimenez & Tachizawa, 2012) , “Managing sustaina bility reporting: many ways to publish exemplary reports” (Thijssens et al., 2016) , “Integra tion and organizational change towards sustainability” (Sroufe, 2017) . These studies guided not only the integration and decoupled concepts, but also important elements to understand the level of sustainability integration in the firms.", "With the purpose of fac ilitating the comparison and analysis of the sample, the integration concept was broken down into three main dimensions (strategy, engagement and accountability) and six sub -dimensions (goals alignment, everyday actions/decisions, leader’s and employee’s e ngagement, internal and external accountability) based on the set of studies previously mentioned, particularly Thijssens et al (2016) and Sroufe (2017) , which talk about how firms manage their SR process and how leaders operationalize sustainability in organizational stra tegy, systems and activities, respectively (Table 1).

Engagement Leader’s “Another finding that contributes to the notion of an integrated sustainability is that in all companies the board is involved in formulating the sustainability strategy. This finding corresponds to earlier literature, stating that senior management involv ement is essential for integrated sustainability” (p. 95, Thijssens et al., 2016) . “Key internal drivers of integration towards sustainability include leadership, a history of environmental activities, and the presence of activities managing social performance” (p. 321, Srou fe, 2017) .", "Employee’s", "“Employee engagement is important, and “bringing together organizations around the annual reporting process helps to get everyone on board” (…) respondents recognize the importance of understanding “how” to measure integrated sustainability and strategic a ctivities”.

RESEARCH METHOD", "3.1 Research Design", "This research investigates the implementation process of GRI focusing on how firms integrate sustainability between practices and reporting. The unit of analysis is the firm – but within the firm we analyze across organizational levels and functions. The research method consists of a multiple case -study with four Brazilian firms of the electric sector, a highly regulated sector that demands GRI standards in SR. We have collecte d qualitative data from two different sources: (1) semi -structured in -depth interviews with professionals from each firm; (2) their 2020 SR, in reference to 2019 performance. Moreover, media articles concerning the sustainability performance of those firms throughout 2019 were used in the post -hoc analysis, comparing the self -narrative from the firms to the one from the media. Therefore, primary and secondary data were combined to support data analysis.", "On the present study we have focused on understanding the level of integrated sustainability of a highly regulated sector in relation to GRI standards in SR, which was the research scope. In this sector, firms’ SR have similar characteristics as they are e qually regulated by institutions. Therefore, choosing this sector had the purpose of creating a homogeneous context for the sample. Additionally, as mentioned before, a regulated sector could turn reporting into routinized check -list activity (Brown et al. , 2009), contributing to the decision to investigate the integration level of sustainability in this context. The level of integration focuses on two aspects: the integration level between the sustainable activities within the firm and its impacts (means -end decoupling) and the integration level of sustainability among different internal departments. In this study, we have chosen the sustainability department and the procurement department, considering the depth of involvement with sustainability of the fi rst and the relevance of the second, concerning the significant social and environmental impacts from the suppliers. While the sustainability department will provide internal data of the SR process, the procurement department will provide information from those who work indirectly with this process, complementing with an external point of view. Hence, the procurement department contributes to how a department perceives the SR and its relevance. The data also ranged from leadership positions to analysts, providing information both about decision making and operational processes.", "The next table shows how the integration level was analyzed for each of the firms (table 2).

The results c ontribute to understanding the current level of integration of the firms, not having the focus to compare their sustainability practices and reporting in a timeline. According to this research, an integrated sustainability firm is characterized by a strate gy alignment, engagement and sustainable accountability. However, a firm with a strategy misalignment with goals and everyday actions and decisions, not engaging leaders and employees about sustainability and not being accountable internally and externally sustainably and are characteristics of a decoupled firm.

Being a heavy industry with complex operations, this industry is responsible for signific ant environmental impact (Onkila et al., 2018) . This industry is also considered as a sector with high pressure from investors and with a close proximity to customers (Fernandez -Feijoo et al., 2014) . On the one hand, the existence of investors pressure contributed to the increase in the levels of reporting transparency. On the other hand, a closer relationship with customer instigates the rise in transparency to improve the brand image (Fernandez -Feijoo et al., 2014) . Secondly, in the case of the Brazilian context, there are governmental regulation from the Brazilian National Electricity Agency, demanding firms to annually report their social, environmental and economic impacts (ANEEL, 2021) . The agency strongly recommends the adoption of GRI guidelines, which is the most common choic e of electric firms to fulfill this regulation. Hence, this sector is highly regulated in this matter.", "Thirdly, the electric sector has a unique supply chain due to the involvement of the government. It operates the market through licenses, concessions or authorizations to firms, that must follow a series of rules from various institutions (CPFL, 2021) . In this supply chain, we have the producers, generators, transmitters, distributors, selling agents and their suppliers and sub-suppliers. Therefore, the sustainabil ity context is shaped by institutional actors. Also, firms in the electric sector are an interesting case to study as they have been elaborating reports for many years and are already well familiarized with GRI. It is a mature sector regarding SR. Firms in the electric sector have similarities, for instance, in their social and environment impacts, internal structure and so forth, but they also have differences, such as, their type of firms: one is a mixed economy and publicly traded firm, the other is a private firm controlled", "by a holding and the other is a publicly traded firm controlled by an international group. Therefore, there are some particularities when analyzing the firms’ profile (table 3). This study focuses on understating the level of integr ation of each company separately, but also compare their results with the purpose of finding differences between their sustainability management inside the regulated sector.", "Initially, four firms were partic ipating in this research, however, one firm withdrawn its involvement during the interview phase of the research. Consequently, three firms continue to participate. They are large firms in Brazil, operating in different states. All of them work with genera tion, distribution, transmission, commercialization and energy solutions. Some firms, such as Alfa, Beta and Gama (fictitious names were given due to a non -disclosure agreement signed as a condition to participate in the study), work with different types o f energy generation, such as hydroelectric, thermal, solar and wind. Furthermore, the firms participate in volunteering and international initiatives, for example, coordinated by United Nations Global Compact, which commits to relevant themes, such as huma n rights, environment, human labor and anti -corruption (UN Global Compact, 2021) . Therefore, the firms have been involved with sustainability actions not only in mandatory activities, but also in voluntary initiatives. Two of them have published SR since 2010, one since 2012 and another since 2006. Hence, all of them have plenty experience working on SR. Furthermore, except for firm Delta, the average sustainability team size is 7 employees, responsible for developing the repor ts annually.

Regarding the first dimension, strategy, not only the managers of both departments, but also the analysts agreed that the Alpha’ business decisions had taken into account sustainability goals. Also, their operation followed their sustainability strategy, vision and values, according to the interviewees and their report. Therefore, all data converged in this dimension. The sam e convergence was found when analyzing the other dimensions, suggesting that Alpha had an integrated sustainability.", "All four interviewees talked about Alpha’ strategy and goal alignment. I1 mentioned the development of the sustainability department as an important action for the improvement of the firm sustainability strategy and I2 talked about the perks of being part of a large holding, having direct guidelines. While I3 pointed out the global sustainability vision of Alpha, I4 mentioned their internal sustainability strategy, having their dimensions aligned with the GRI methodology. Alpha SR also emphasized that their business model was sustainable and monitored by environmental, social and governance (ESG) dimensions. Additionally, I1 mentioned their g lobal sustainability plan, which had guided Brazil sustainability department goals and I2 pointed out their continuous work on the SR throughout", "the year. In the procurement department, their daily work was characterized by, for example, defining the requi rements for selecting suppliers (I3) and measuring their dimensions that qualify their suppliers and informing the output to the SR (I4). Therefore, their everyday actions and decisions took into consideration sustainability practices. The report also was aligned with this dimension since commented about the continuous work to improve their environmental management.", "In relation to the engagement dimension, while I1 mentioned the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) vision and the firm changes toward sustainabilit y, I2 talked about their mission to the world as leaders. The involvement of their leaders in their operations (I3) and their sustainable dimensions and goals (I4) was also mentioned by the interviewees. Regarding their SR, it mentioned that leaders are en gaged by the CEO which publicly made a commitment with UN to support their agenda with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The firm strategies and goals were aligned with the SDGs. Concerning their employee engagement, I1 mentioned a culture sustaina bility program that instigated their employees about their sustainable actions, workshops and conversations also happened between the sustainability area with other areas (I2). I3 confirmed this testifying his own experience while participation on the SR d evelopment as a buyer and I4 mentioned their collaborations with the sustainability area, besides reporting. Their SR corroborated with this engagement when mentioning their sustainability culture program. Since 2015 the firm has been reinforcing this cult ure with several activities. In 2019, 64 activities were made in ten different states, involving more than 3,000 participations. For example, through this program, the firm ha s been running through the firm’s operations and engaging with their collaborator s with the purpose of advancing in their sustainability culture and in their compliance in their energy generation.", "Regarding the last dimension: accountability, in the internal environment the sustainable accountability was made considering their sustain ability plan and report (I1), their understanding GRI methodology (I2), the definition of their sustainability issues and guidelines (I3) and their ESG requirements to their suppliers (I4). Their internal accountability with sustainability was also identif ied in their report when, for instance, they disclosed their work on a circular economy plan.", "Moreover, there were some interesting points brought by the interviewees about their external accountability, such as, contributing to a culture of sustainabilit y in different areas and with very different professionals (I1). One of Alpha priorities, according to their materiality matrix, was with their suppliers (I2) which must follow ESG qualification requirements (I3).", "An assessment system existed to track the supplier qualification before and during their contract with the firm (I3). They assessed throughout a technical evaluation, considering environmental, safety, human rights, compliance and financial health aspects. The evaluation change d depending on the m aterials and services that this supplier was providing. Different strategies were developed to monitor the suppliers, such as, a tool to check the supplier’s history of corruption and fraud, 24 -hour sweep about the suppliers’ activities, independent inspec tions on their facilities and activities (I3, I4). Moreover, Alfa had their own methodology to evaluate the suppliers, generating a score system based on the suppliers’ performance (I4). As a result, Alfa managed the suppliers’ performance, developing plan s for them to improve (I3). The collaborative activities were part of a bigger program called “Responsible Partner”: “together with the sustainability team, we are trying to make the supplier evolve, develop to reach our required level” (I3). This program connected Alfa with their suppliers, being responsible for several meetings between them and opening more communication channels with them. “We have the work that the team itself, the supplier area does, and all our work within the Responsible Partner, th ere are several annual meetings, then there are awards, anyway, it's an audience also that we have a very close relationship” (I2). Meetings about ethics, circular economy, Covid -19, for instance, were made. Alfa also helped with benchmarking and sharing successful sustainable projects made with other actors in the market (I4), having a constant exchange with their suppliers (I3). In their report, Alfa also had detailed their suppliers’ assessment, explaining that this stakeholder has been prioritized recen tly. They explained their monitoring process, explained the supplier qualification and verification stages, valuing the suppliers which adopt sustainability practices. Also, the SR commented about collaborative actions, such as, workshops to suppliers abou t safety matters, environmental and human rights their “Responsible Partner” program, indicating that it corroborated with the interviewee’s speech about their suppliers.", "Therefore, from the data collected and analyzed, it indicate d that Alpha has an integ rated sustainability since the data from the sustainability and procurement department converged, the data from the managers and analysts converged and the narrative from the interviews and report converged.

In Appendix A -Quotes there are exemplary quotes that corroborate the analysis. In relation to the first dimension – strategy – the interviews speech and the report diverged in the sense that while the report emphasized the alignment between Beta business and corporate sustai nability, the interviewees pointed out some controversial information, such as difficulties to respond their SR (I6, I7, I8). Some dimensions that were used to the SR implementation process were not integrated in their daily management and strategy. This divergency was also identified when comparing the two departments and the hierarchical structure, because only I5 from the sustainability team pointed out that their strategy and goals were aligned. The other three interviews agreed that there was some deco upling across Beta’s strategy and goals.", "The divergency also happened when talking about their everyday action and decisions related to sustainability, even though I5 didn’t mention any information about this topic, the other interviewees mentioned that th e SR implementation process was considered an additional work of their daily work routine (I6, I7). Only I8 thought that their daily work was already incorporated with SR practices. Therefore, the divergence was identified vertically. There was also diverg ence in the narrative since the report suggested that sustainable decisions were already incorporated into their routine. Furthermore, the interviewees had mentioned some issues while responding questions related to the GRI dimensions. For instance, the di fficulties", "of integrating the information needed for SR since the data was spread out in different teams from the same area (I8). In addition, the challenge of updating the internal process, such as creating, improving or evolving dimensions, but not under standing how to report these updates (I7). These issues corroborate that Beta was still struggling to integrate their sustainability practices and reporting.", "Regarding their engagement dimension, there were divergency aspects. When analyzing the leader’s engagement, I5, I8 and the SR pointed out positive engagement practices, however, I6 and I7 mentioned issues regarding their involvement with sustainability topics. Therefore, were divergencies between the departments, hierarchically and between the interv iewees and the report. Even though leaders considered this report relevant, there were some leaders more involved with sustainability than others (I6). Leaders could improve their involvement in the SR process, giving opinions and feedbacks about the emplo yees’ work (I7). Also, I7 mentioned that “when things come from above, what do we do? We are directed (…) if no one is asking me, if my manager is not asking (…) I have other priorities” (I7). Thus, leaders still needed to improve their engagement in the S R process. According to their SR, Beta “believes that the training of its workforce is fundamental to achieving its strategic objectives with sustainability” (p. 143, Beta, 2020). Therefore, the firm invested vigorously in university courses. Not only to employees, but also to their leaders, a workshop about human rights was developed by the firm leaders with the purpose of discussing this topic and it’ impact. In addition, they have received strategic trainings, improving their abilities on their positions . Beta also formalized the creation of a Sustainability Committee with the purpose of integrating the firm’ sustainability with its’ management. However, the SR mentioned that some of their sustainability goals were not recognized strategically by their le aders, suggesting that leaders could improve their participation in sustainability management (SR Beta, 2020). While the report mentioned employee engagement practices within the firm, the interviewees (all of them) pointed out that the engagement work ins ide the firm about sustainability practices was weak. Even though there were engagement initiatives with the employees about the SR, such as, an online newsletter (I5), employees did not involve and comprehend the report (I6). Therefore, a divergence in th e narrative was identified.", "In the case of accountability, internally, the divergency appeared in the narrative analysis. According to their SR, they had sustainability as a goal since they aimed an open and transparent dialogue with their stakeholders. T he firm had already won three times an international award of being the top 20 firms most sustainable in a global ranking. Moreover, the firm had disclosed", "their sustainability plan which one of the goals was to align their sustainability initiatives with their strategic planning and integrate sustainable practices in their culture. The firm emphasized its participation in rankings, other transparency framework or reporting practices, indicating their presence on the market as a sustainable firm. However, t he four interviewees mentioned issues about the overall employee’s wrong vision about sustainability. In the interviews, culture was mentioned when talking about a reporting culture: “People understand that there are those dimensions, that they have to rep ort, it is cultural at Beta to know that there is a report for the concession” (I5). It seems that sustainability did not permeate the entire firm since some employees had a vision that only the sustainability team was responsible for the sustainability goals. Thus, considering the department and the hierarchical aspects, there was a convergence. However, this alignment was indicating that Beta’s having issues to promote sustainability within the firm. Therefore, in this case, the convergence reflected, neg atively, the firm sustainability integration.", "When analyzing the external accountability, it was found that everything converged. I7 and I8 gave more details about their suppliers’ assessment since they were from the procurement monitoring team.", "“There are the inspections that are carried out, installations, in relation to the manufacturing process, there are some checks, some documents that we ask that we certify, look for sustainability issues. And what we respond to in these reports are those activiti es that we do that involve analysis of the supplier's sustainability other than in the actual hiring process. The yes or no decision ends up being in the bidding process, but the requirements that we place in order to check if the supplier he meets, these things that we do” (I8).", "I7 confirmed that the information on the SR came from the supplier registration with their system, inspections, technical evaluation among others. The monitoring occurred before and during the supplier contract with the firm throug h monthly measured dimensions. If the supplier had a performance below the firm’ target in any of the dimensions, they needed to come up with an action plan. There were penalties and bonuses depending on the supplier’ qualification (I7, I8). Regarding coll aboration between the firm and their supplier, I8 mentioned about one program where they trained electricians, making sure the security issues were being followed by the suppliers. It was also mentioned other training programs, for example, about human rights practices (I6). However, the interviewees did not discuss the details about collaborative activities between the firm and their suppliers. I5 mentioned that they had a very strong bond with the supply area, because they “give tips on how to suddenly ha ve a benchmarking that", "we've already taken a course, so they can see if they can implement somehow. It is more of a follow -up, suddenly giving an idea, exchanging an idea to see how to improve” (I5). Therefore, the data indicated that collaborative activit ies had taken place with the suppliers. Their SR was aligned with their speech since it was explained that they evaluated their suppliers’ impact in relation to human rights, demanding a stricter rule in this topic. Their assessment involved the suppliers’ compliance with their ethics and conduct policies, social and environmental responsibilities, UN Global Compact principles, technical certifications and so forth. They had their own supplier performance monitoring process with goals and requirements, whic h demanded specific dimensions to be analyzed, such as health and environment and their verification of the firm’s employees about the suppliers positive and negative impacts. Also, there was the work of organizing procedures and integrated management of s uppliers which contributed to the continuous improvement of the connection of processes and departments that related to suppliers (SR, Beta, 2020). Therefore, collaborative activities were mentioned in both the interviews and in the report.", "Table 7 shows t hat there were divergences in all dimensions. For three sub -dimension this divergence happened between department, narrative and hierarchically.

Exemplary quotes are in Appendix A - Quotes .", "Regarding their strategy dimension, the firm had goals and challenges aligned with sustainability practices, which had emerged from the convergence between departments, hierarchicall y and between the report and the interviews. The SR process followed the demands and goals established by the main international shareholder which was extremely concern about sustainability (I9, I11). Thus, firm Gama had been passing through some significa nt changes in their SR process since their initial public offering (IPO) and the sustainability management gained their attention since it was a demand from their main shareholder (I9, I10, I11,): “after the IPO the reported started to be seen within the f irm in a different way” (…) the IPO boosted not only the visibility issue, but also people started to give more importance to the document” (I10). Additionally, since 2019 the firm established a non -financial data policy, giving the same relevance that the financial data receives. This policy came from the international shareholder (I9). According to I11, the goal of having a sustainable supply chain was also promoted by the same main shareholder. Therefore, Gama was pressured by their investors’ demands. A ccording to their SR, it was mentioned about their strategic plan for 2018 to 2022 which involved their sustainable development and quality services to the society. The firm stated their commitment to the planet and their long -term strategic vision, being aligned with the SDGs. The strengthening of the culture and the generation of value are established through partnerships with educational institutions, research centers, innovation hubs, startups and public and private institutions. In some of these insti tutions hackathons, immersions based on design thinking, continuous improvement projects and connection with startups for proof of concept are carried out, in order to find innovative solutions to various challenges identified by the business areas (p. 41, Regarding their everyday actions and decisions, the data also converged, the sustainability team deals with questions about the SR daily and the procurement team deals with the firm suppliers, supporting them to become more sustainable. I9 commented that each area has its own processes and projects while I10 mentioned about their daily demand of the investors about their SR and sustainability practices. I11 h as described their process to classify their suppliers as sustainable or not and I12 has pointed out their daily challenge to improve small suppliers towards sustainability practices.", "Moving on to the second dimension: engagement. In relation to the leader ’s involvement, according to I9, there was the engagement of the top leadership in their SR process. The sustainability team interviews the leaders, and they participate in the process validation of data in the report, however, they needed to be more invol ved in the process itself and engage with other areas to support the sustainability team in this project (I9). The leaders participated more actively in the report development by reviewing and validating the information collected for the report (I11). Ther efore, in some areas, like the supply chain team, the leaders were more involved, however, the sustainability team mentioned that in some areas were missing this involvement. Overall, the four interviewees agreed that the leaders were in somehow involved as well as the report, when mentioning sustainable practices with the firm leaders, for example, two “Innovation Days” were held in 2019, providing an innovative environment to executive leaders and workshops for managers and superintendents were also made with the purpose of identify and prioritize opportunities to the firm.", "In the case of engagement with employees, the focus was on internal campaigns with the purpose to approximate employees from the firm businesses (SR Gama, 2020). Moreover, the report m entioned trainings about their ethical codes, compliance rules and anticorruption policies. The firm also has invested in their leaders. The interviewees also agreed with the report with the exception of I10, which pointed out that there is a higher involv ement from the areas when the top management involvement is greater, as a result, there were areas which their engagement is not boosted by the leaders, making harder for them to understand the SR relevance and the process (I10).", "“So, a great challenge tha t we have, that we have already improved a lot, is to engage the areas, because as I mentioned at the beginning, the projects boosted sustainability, we manage the dimensions, so we need the areas appropriate these dimensions for them throughout the year t o manage this information, so that at the end of the year they can report with quality, there is no need to wait until the end of the year, in short, being able to answer the dimensions, I think this is the (...) is a change in culture” I9 pointed out that since they entered the stock market the understanding about the GRI dimensions have improved. Conversely I11 mentioned the role of their main shareholder to improve the engagement of this matter within the firm. An issue was risen concerning the outsourced: “I think that's it, there may be a delay, I won't even say a delay, a problem, maybe, in outsourced workers, because I feel that many outsourced, for example, don't really feel part of the firm, so, many do not even see the communication, the re ports”, but for the employees", "“the engagement is total” (I12). Hence, the employee’s engagement still had some issues. Thus, in this sub -dimension, there was a divergency in between the departments and hierarchically since I10 pointed out issues with emplo yee engagement when I9, I11 and I12 mentioned positively this engagement. The report was aligned with the 3 interviewees.", "In relation to the last dimension: accountability – not only internally, but also externally the interviews and the report suggested that the firm had been in an on -going work toward a sustainable culture. Considering I9, the firm had been raising awareness about the importance of the GRI dimensions, but they could improve this work and improve the management perspective of the report a nd its methodology. Gama had issues responding the GRI dimensions. They were struggling to integrate and compare the data from different business, such as, generation, commercialization, distribution into one key performance dimension for the firm (I10). T he complexity of the environmental dimensions was also mentioned as a challenge to respond and responding the impacts from the suppliers (I9).", "However, I10 agrees that an on -going work it have been happening: “As long as you report the three years, you c an compare yourself, you compare your business with other businesses, you see its evolution, to what extent you have improved or worsened, so for me it is an excellent management tool, not just for transparency, for accountability”. Also, the sustainabilit y team took the responsibility of passing this knowledge to the other areas which were not acquainted with that:", "“My role, I think, is to engage, to show the value that this document has for the firm, to show that it is not a simple document, it is not a s imple report, that it really \"tangles\" the socio -environmental issue and the economic issue, it generates value for the firm, it is not a simple document that you make to be accountable. It would be for people to really understand that it is a management t ool” (I10).", "In the procur ement department, I11 mentioned that the firm is facing a big challenging improving the sustainability toward their suppliers and I12 talked about the importance of their team analysis. Their SR emphasized their work toward sustainability, promoting innovation and ecoefficiency to reduce the environmental impact, for example. Therefore, in relation to Gama internal accountability, it seems that the interviews and the report converged in the sense that a work had been done toward a sustainable culture, however, it can be improved since the GRI dimensions did not seem completely as management tools. This aspect, however, was only possible to understand through the interviewees, with the SR alone it would not be possible to perceive this issue. As a result, there was a divergence between the data from", "Conside ring firm Gama supply chain assessment, it has started doing concrete actions since 2019, therefore, it has yet a lot to evolve to have a sustainable supply chain (I11). For instance, their current supplier awards, which happens every two years, do not ben efit the suppliers considering their sustainability actions and performance (I12). Currently, there are some suppliers, which are at a higher level towards sustainability than other, as a result, Gama have been supporting and guiding them to develop sustai nable actions and to fulfill the ESG questionnaire and requirements established by the Gama procurement department (I11). “I need to be guiding the supplier all the time, talking about why he has to do it, there are such basic things that we cannot imagin e. People who work in large firms, sometimes, do not imagine that a supplier, sometimes, does not know that it is important to carry out preventive maintenance on vehicles, it is something too basic, simple. So, I think that the most part (...) for me, is personally, the biggest challenge I have now is to leverage the sustainability of suppliers, is to inform them what they can do, it is kind of saying “supplier, let's do the calculation of your carbon footprint \"so much simple\" let's do a code of conduct f or your firm \",\" just do and publish \". So, like that, it's kind of a babysitting role for the supplier. It's been my biggest challenge” (I12).", "Therefore, the main goal was to guide the suppliers on how to take sustainable actions, caring more about their social, environmental and economic impacts. Gama had taken on the role of motivating agent along the supply chain (I11). The system to monitor the suppliers was created recently and the mandatory requirements were changed in the last year, so that, sustain able aspects were included to manage the suppliers (I12). They evaluated technically the suppliers, checking their financial status, compliance, risks, among others, having an organized assessment system: “it is very well tied from the supplier management process” (I12). The suppliers were classified according to a scoring system and goals were established for them to improve their sustainability performance (I12). Thus, firm Gama had just started assessing their suppliers since they invested recently in a system to manage and guide them with technical and informational support. Although, the interviews did not indicate a collaborative relationship between the firm and their supplier, the collaboration can happen in the future since the organization is at an early stage in this matter.", "“I think concrete actions, stronger actions, let's say, started to emerge last year. This year is already with a much larger footprint in relation to this and the trend is to evolve year by year. But, even so, I think we are a t the beginning, but I think it is being scaled there and a little exponential, let's say, we are evolving a lot in this aspect, following the last few years” (I11).", "In their SR, one collaborative activity with their suppliers was mentioned: the electricia n's school, where safety trainings are demanded, their partnership with other institution in order to support the supplier development and their communication channels with their suppliers.", "Considering this aspect, there was a divergence between the narrat ive between the interviews and the report regarding the collaborative activities.", "From our data analysis (table 8), Gama still has some issues with their integrated sustainability. There was divergency in their speeches in two of the three dimensions. In one dimension the divergency happened with the narrative analysis due to two reasons. The first one indicated that from the report was not possible to have all the information when compared with the interviews and the second one suggested that from the int erviews it was not possible to have all the information when compared with the report. About the third dimension, it had shown a divergency with one of the interviewees speeches which had a different point of view of when compared with the report and the o ther interviewees. Additionally, even when the data was converged, there were some issues and challenges brought by the interviewees showing that there was a lot of space to their evolvement toward sustainability culture.

Hence, the sustainability is not an", "additional work. It appeared that top management is involved with the SR and with the sustainability strategy of the firm as well as the employees. The report is a consequence of the sustainability team and all the areas of the fi rm. The GRI methodology is understood by the areas and they have been working with GRI dimensions as part of their management, not just considering them an accountability tool. Thus, they have a sustainability culture within the firm since the understandin g of GRI and its relevance permeate the firm. They have interesting programs that improve the engagement, participation, collaboration with their suppliers. To conclude, the level of integration of Alpha was analyzed considering the two approaches of this research and it converged. They integrate the sustainability through their strategy, engagement and accountability fitting in the integrated sustainability concept brought by this research. However, this was not seen in the other two electricity firms stud ied.", "By analyzing the interviews, it seems that firm Beta is closer to decoupling since there are divergences in their integration toward sustainability. The sustainability management is not part of the daily routine, the areas still do not understand the GRI g uidelines and its relevance and the GRI is not used as a management tool. However, I8 and I6 mentioned some points of improvement regarding integrated sustainability, and they seem to have punctual collaborative activities with their suppliers, indicating that initiatives that nurture shared sustainable values exists. Therefore, they have been aware that more integration between the areas is needed. In relation to firm Gama, it has passed through some significant changes in their SR process since their IPO and the sustainability management gained their attention since it is a demand from their main shareholder. This new context contributed to the firm convergence between the interviews and the report regarding the firm strategy and goals aligned with sustai nability practices. From the interviews, these changes were associated with the pressure of their main international shareholder. According to (Thijssens et al., 2016), when the pressure for SR and sustainable practices comes from external actors, it seems that there is not an integrated sustainability in the firm because their focus is on their report or image, instead of their sustainability performance. Thus, the involvement of their shareholder puts into question how deeply integration is the sustainabi lity in Gama operations. Moreover, their employee engagement has issues, GRI methodology not understood by some areas, investment in the collaboration with supply chain is needed as well as with their sustainability culture, especially with outsourced coll aborators. Thus, they do not fit in the context of a firm with integrated sustainability practices.", "In view of this, the data collected from the interviews revealed that in a highly regulated sector in relation to GRI standards in SR, the reporting and sustainability practices are not standardized. While in one firm, its operation and their supply chain have an integrated sustainability considering their SR process in other two firms, issues were risen regarding the level of integrated sustainability wit hin their operation. A careful analysis was made comparing the three firms (Table 9). A yes was written after the firm codename, representing that a convergency was found when comparing the dimension to the type of analysis and a No was written for the cas es that was not found a convergency.", "A closer look in each analysis reveals that, regarding their strategy, it was found convergencies in Alpha and Gama not only between the department, but between the interviews and the report and hierarchically. However, in Beta analysis was concluded that the firm has divergences between department, different level positions and with the report, indicating that there is a decoupling with the misalignment between their actions and strategic goals. Concerning the dimension engagement, Alpha once again has converged in the three analyses, while Beta had the opposite result. With the employee engagement, there is a convergency between the interviewees, therefore, the difference is with the narrative analysis and with the lead er’s, there are issues in all three analyses. These indicate that Beta still have a big challenge to work with. Leader’s and employee’s engagement are crucial to the development of a sustainability focused on performance instead of reporting. In the case o f Gama, the difference was between department and hierarchically, indicating that their internal engagement could be weak or initial.", "When analyzing the accountability, only one firm converged in the three analysis – Alpha, indicating that they have a str onger sustainability culture and integration. Beta and Gama had convergency between their interviewees but are signaling decoupling practices since it was found a divergency with the report narrative. In this dimension, is important to point out that while Beta only diverged internally, especially with issues concerning the promotion of the sustainability practices in their operation, in Gama was found differences internally and externally. Internally, the narrative with the report was the issue since it di d not disclose about the challenges and problems that the firm has been facing while working toward sustainability. Externally, the divergency was narrative and focused on the collaborative activities, which the interviews did not mention, and the report d id.", "Table 9: Cross -case Analysis", "Dimensions/Aspects Department Hierarchical Narrative Strategy Alpha: Yes Alpha: Yes Alpha: Yes Beta: No Beta: No Beta: No Gama: Yes Gama: Yes Gama: Yes Engagement Alpha: Yes Alpha: Yes Alpha: Yes Beta: No Beta: No Beta: No Gama: No Gama: No Gama: Yes Accountability Alpha: Yes Alpha: Yes Alpha: Yes Beta: Yes* Beta: Yes* Beta: No Gama: Yes* Gama: Yes* Gama: No *Indicates that the convergence is characterized by negative aspects. Source: The author Considering this, in this study was found three types of divergency. The first one is when the firm has divergences in all the three types of approaches analyzed (department, hierarchical and narrative), indicating that not only the firm has decoupled in t he report, but also has not consolidated important integrated sustainability dimensions internally. The second type of divergency happen when the difference is only found in the narrative analysis, suggesting that there is misalignment when developing the report. The third type of divergency occurs when there are inconsistencies between the department and level position, suggesting that the dimension analyzed was not consolidated in the firm operations. Comparing the firms with the three types of divergenci es, the first divergency was found twice in Beta and the second type one time. In the case of Gama, it was found the second and the third type of divergences and in Alpha none divergency. Thus, it seems that Alpha has a better and robust integrated sustain ability when compared to Beta and Gama. Even though Gama sustainability practices and actions is associated with their IPO process and main shareholder pressure, they seem to be more advance in the path toward an integrated sustainability when compared to Beta. In the case of Beta, instead of focusing on their sustainability performance, it seems that the focus is", "on the reporting, thus, there is ingrained problems with their sustainability strategy, engagement and accountability.", "Reflecting about the research question of this study:", "To what extent do firms under compliance to GRI standards integrate sustainability practices and sustainability reporting?", "Comparing with our data analysis, it seems that even in a mature sector rega rding SR, such as the electric sector, the sustainability integration can be explained by three dimensions: strategy, engagement and accountability. Comparing them with the department, hierarchical and narrative analysis, each firm is in a different stage in this integration process. Considering the analysis from Table 9, Alpha is clearly more mature in this matter, since 100% the data has converged, therefore, there is a predominance of converged data in their analysis, indicating the presence of sustainab ility integration. In the case of Alpha, the sustainability integration is part of their strategy, engagement and accountability. However, in Beta and Gama different results were found.", "In case of Beta, even though it was found converged data in the accountability dimension (department and hierarchical aspects), this convergence is characterized by negative aspects, indicating that the firm has issues regarding their sustainability integr ation. Therefore, in Beta’s case, in none of the three dimensions analyzed was integrated. In the case of Gama, 44,44% of the data converged, indicating that their sustainability integration is not predominant (less than 50%). They integrated the SR with s ustainability practices in the strategy and in the narrative aspect of the engagement dimension. In the accountability two convergences were found, but it was negatively related to the firm. Additionally, Gama have issues with their employee’s and leader’s engagement.", "Comparing, the three firms, Alpha has a stronger level of sustainability integration, followed by Gama and then Beta. While Alpha integrate their SR with sustainability practices considering the three dimensions already mentioned, Beta and Ga ma are still struggling with their integration process in these dimensions. From this analysis, it seems that the first step is achieving the strategy dimension, however understanding the second step is blurred since not only Beta but also Gama had issues in the other two remaining dimensions. Thus, more research", "is still necessary to understand with accuracy the relationship of the three dimensions with the sustainability integration.", "In the strategy dimension, Beta has a divergency in all of the three as pects analyzed, indicating that the sustainability integration is not perceived internally. This happened in both of the strategy’ sub -dimensions. However, in the case of Alpha and Gama, this dimension is converged, signaling a more mature environment and suggesting that the first step towards sustainability integration.", "Overall, the cross -case analysis showed that sustainability integration could be understood while comparing the strategy, engagement and accountability of the firm with their department, h ierarchical and narrative alignment.", "4.3 Post -hoc Analysis", "After analyzing the three firms and understanding better about their integration of sustainability in their business, another analysis was made: how the media is publicizing their sustainability performance. Researching how an external actor is portraying these firms gives a different perspective for this research since our primary analysis only considered self -data from the firms (their employees and their self -made report). Therefore, the data found in the newspapers about the tree firms were compared with the data disclose in their SR. Regarding this phase of the analysis, two newspapers were considered: “Valor Econômico” and “Folha de São Paulo”. Both are recognized and well -known Brazilian newspaper. Regarding Alpha analysis, it was found 63 articles mentioning their name, 38 were news about citizens’ complaints about the firm’s service quality, such as, charge undue fines to consumers, accidents with electricity poles, blackouts among others . Moreover, 16 articles were about a specific case which the Brazilian government is complaining about the poor service of Alpha in the central west region, where the firm has the concession electricity services. These articles explain the complaints and t he development of this case in the court of law. Additionally, there was one article about the government complaints about the firm’s service quality which is not related to the previous case mentioned. However, it was found 8 articles about Alpha positive impact, mentioning their innovative and sustainable actions, such as, their investment in a solar park, investment in digital innovations or mentioning their efficiency and seal of integrity.", "In relation to Alpha SR, they mention throughout the report se veral positive and sustainable initiatives that the firm has worked in 2019. For example, their investments in social projects, in innovation and digitalization process for the electric industry or their investment in decreasing the environmental impact, h elping the climate change crisis among other activities. Regarding their service quality, which was the main topic brought by the media, the firm emphasized their continuous work and investment in this matter.", "Our focus is on excellence in the provision o f services and our investments are focused on the continuous improvement of quality through the digitalization of the network and the use of the most modern technologies, in addition to expanding the capacity of the electric network to increase demand in t he regions where we operate, one of the drivers of our Group's Strategic Planning (p. 50, SR Alpha, 2020).", "Alpha SR mentions several times that the firm invest in the improvement of their services in multiple ways, for instance, through new connections and partnerships, maintaining their international quality certifications such as from the international organization for standardization (ISO), investing in digital technologies etc. In relation to their customer satisfaction ranting, the SR discloses through figures, for example, in 2019, their overall customer satisfaction index increased in one of their distribution regions, in the other three regions this index has decreased. The same result was found in their 2019 perceived quality satisfaction index. How ever, the SR also pointed out positive number, such as their lowest average number of times the consumer was without energy which was in October of 2019. In relation to the central west complaints with the government, the SR did not mention specifically these issues, but descant about their operations and improvement in this region. Thus, after analyzing the data from the media, it indicates that the two newspapers publish more negative news about the service quality of the firm when compared with positive news. When comparing this data with the SR, it suggests that the report shows some accurate figures about their service but highlights their achievements and progress in their service quality.", "In relation to Beta’ data analysis, from the 70 findings mentio ning their name, 28 articles were about the privatization process endorsed by the local government. According to some articles, the main reason the government wants to privatize Beta is due to their unsatisfied services. More 3 articles were found pointing out negative aspects of Beta service, for example, breaches found in the inspection of the firm's energy distribution service continuity dimensions. Additionally, one article has mentioned a possible involvement of Beta with illegal mining in", "the past and 10 articles were about corruption scandals involving bribery, resource deviations being directly or indirectly involved with Beta. Moreover, 20 articles were about the firm financial performance, 6 about the firm’ investments in renewable energy, 2 about their participation in sustainable projects.", "In Beta SR, the term privatization was found in only one time in the report when an institutional meeting was mentioned. At this meeting the high leadership discussed the firm near future, indicating that one o f the scenarios could be their privatization, as a result, they emphasized the need for Beta improve on their efficiency and in sustainable practices. The research also was extended to the term corruption, due to the corruption scandal brought up by the ne wspapers which was involving Beta. Throughout their report, the term corruption and anticorruption are used to indicate their initiatives fighting against corruption. For example, they have ethical conducts, ethical commission, anticorruption guidelines, p olicies and trainings. Additionally, they analyze the background of their partners and suppliers and they are a signatory of the Business Pact for Integrity and Against Corruption coordinated by the Ethos Institute. Another practice within the firm is a sy stem that register and treat illegal issues, in 2019, there were 32 complaints related to corruption. According to their report: “13 cases refer to misconduct directly linked to corruption, 8 of which had their investigations completed and 5 are in progre ss. Of the completed cases, in 4 of them, suspension was applied to the employee and for the other 4 cases guidance was applied; 17 cases refer to conflicts of interest with characteristics of fraud or corruption, 10 of which were concluded and had guidanc e on how to handle them, and 7 cases are in progress; In the remaining 2 cases, investigation processes were initiated that resulted in the dismissal of the employees involved”. (p. 74, SR Beta, 2020). Moreover, their SR discloses information about a spe cific case which is under Brazilian police investigation, but it pointed out that they did an internal investigation, which resulted that that there is not a concluded corruption action, however, there are irregularities in the conduct of business and exec ution of contracts. Considering this, Beta presented their solutions to these issues which are: internal audit following the best corporate governance practices and international guidelines and the creation of a process compliance dimension, which will acc ess the effectiveness of events arising from process audit. From this dimension, goals will be developed and the non -compliance of them will affect the high leadership wage. Even though Beta discloses about action on fighting corruption, they disclose abou t one corruption episode. From the articles, it was found ten news about their involvement with corruption, pointing out other cases where the firm was mentioned in illegal scandals.", "Regarding Beta service quality, the SR indicates that the firm has some issues through some data disclosed, for instance, “in 2019, approximately R$ 50 million was paid in compensation to Beta's customers for violation of individual dimensions of continuity of electricity supply. This compensation amount was 8.2% higher than in 2018” (p. 95, SR Beta, 2020). At the same time the firm shows some improvements in their service quality, such as, the firm exceeded in 2019 their best result since 2009 in their customer satisfied dimension. However, their customer satisfaction dimensi on is the perceived quality satisfaction Index of 2019 was reduced by 11.3%. According to the report, a data crossings survey was made by external parties, but were not conclusive as to the reason that led the consumer to this less favorable evaluation.", "Hence, Beta analysis is controversial. Even though they disclose information about their service quality and corruption scandals, it seems that more detailed information could have been disclosed, for example, mentioning their involvement in other corrupti on scandals. Additionally, with Beta more negative news were found in the newspapers when compared with the positive news about them.", "Considering Gama data analysis, 30 articles were about their financial performance, a lot of them were focusing on the fi rm’ IPO process and primary results. In total, there were 13 articles pointing out sustainable actions from the firm: 4 articles were about their investments in renewable energy, one article was about their seal of integrity achievement, other examples of actions mentioned were: green bond emission, conscious consumption campaign, investments in low carbon projects. In their SR, they mention their IPO throughout the document, they disclose their financial performance following international guidelines and mention their sustainable practices developed over 2019, including their investment in renewable energy. Therefore, it converges with the data from the newspapers articles. In this case, it was found more positive news about the firm than negative news. For this research, this data enlightened the analysis since it pointed out that Gama disclosed information in the report converges with the information portrayed by the media. However, in the case of Alpha and Beta the disclosed information diverges partiall y from the newspapers. Alpha issues with service quality was pointed out by some figures in the report, but more details about the customer complaints could have been disclosed and with Beta the same issue was found. Besides that, Beta has issues with corr uption scandals that could have been disclose completely, mentioning all their supposedly involvement in different cases of corruption.", "Comparing the analysis developed in the previous section with the post -hoc analysis, it indicates that Alpha has contro versial results since between department, hierarchically and narrative the analysis has converged, suggesting that they practice an integrated sustainability. However, from the media there were a lot of negative articles about the firm, especially about the quality of their service, putting into question if their level of integrated sustainability. In the case of Beta, the previous analysis and the post -hoc analysis have converged since in both the data has shown that the firm has issues with their sustaina bility practices and transparency. In relation to Gama, their findings were also controversial, since in the previous analysis they had diverged with some dimensions, but in the post -hoc analysis the data found converged. This could indicate that their sus tainability work in on the right path, even though is in just the beginning. It is recommended a more complete study about how the media converges with the firm’s transparency, regarding their sustainability practices.", "This analysis was shallow and punctu al. New data can be analyzed from other newspapers, being an excellent source for future research since in this study only a comparison was made between the 2019 articles found in two newspapers with the 2019 reports. Additionally, due to media bias, it is vital to develop future research considering a more careful analysis of this aspect with the purpose of investigate the level of sustainability integration with accuracy.", "5. CONCLUSIONS", "Overall, this study has focused on understanding how firms do integrate d in a Brazilian highly regulated sector that considers GRI standards in SR. For firms looking to improve environmental and social performance, whilst maintaining their financial bottom line, the question is less about whether or not to pursue sustainabili ty, but rather how (Luzzini et al., 2015) and this was the focus of this study. The main goal was to investigate how firms integrate their SR and sustainability practices, considering the GRI framework.", "The research has considered semi -structured in -depth interviews with professionals from the sustainability and procurement departments of three Brazilian electricity firms, the analysis of SRs published in 2020 and a pot -hoc analysis considering an external factor – the media , thereat two newspapers were analyzed. From the data collected, the level of integrated sustainability in each firm was understood. Their level of integration was analyzed investigating if their data converged or not when considering three types of analysis: department, hierarchi cal and narrative speech. They were compared with the three dimensions (strategy, engagement", "and accountability) and six -sub-dimensions (goals alignment, everyday actions/decisions, employee’s and leader’s engagement and accountability internal and externa l) found from the literature review. After this analysis it was able to understand how the firm’s sustainability integration is, indicating to what extent do firms, considering the GRI guideline, integrate SR and sustainability practices, which was the RQ of this study.", "According to (Lozano, 2015) , a limited number of authors have considered a holistic perspective of sustainabi lity, where there are interactions between economic, environmental and social aspects in short and long run and between internal and external stakeholders. Therefore, this study has limitations. Firstly, the scope is limited to facilitate the analysis, as a result, the sample is not diversified. Thus, considering other industries and business could give better insights about the level of sustainability integration inside the firms. Secondly, this is not a longitudinal study. Thus, studying the past and the present SRs could have given a better analysis of the evolution through time of the firms SR operation. For future research is recommended to analyze the level of integrated sustainability considering a timeline and analyze other business context, for inst ance, in a not a regulated sector.", "In addition, for future research the Brazilian high regulated sector could be compared with another high regulated sector from other country, such as, a European or Latin -American country. Therefore, an international sam ple could give interesting comparison about the sustainability integration journey.", "This study was also limited in the data collection, since it came from the employees and the firm’s self -elaboration sustainability report. Hence, the bias from the data ma y have interfered with the findings. The post -hoc analysis was important since had the purpose of understand ing what the media is publishing about firm’s sustainability practices. However, t he post-hoc analysis was superficial and limited since has conside red a short timeline and only two newspapers. The post -hoc analysis initiate an insipid study about an external point of view of the sustainability practices of the firms . For future research, it is recommended to continue to explore the level of sustainab ility integration considering the media.", "The bias can also be found when considering interpersonal influences, educational background not only of the researchers but also of the interviewees. Those aspects cannot be eliminated and influence in the overall results.", "In relation to the interviewees, it was considered multi -level employees in two different departments (sustainability and procurement departments). This research could be more", "accurate if more employees were interviewed, having a bigger sample of interviewees in the leader and employee position. In addition, if more than two departments were included, such as, the marketing and finance departments, it would also increase the information about how deeply sustainability integration is within the firm . These changes could contribute to a better analysis about the firm strategy, engagement and accountability in sustainability integration. Also, t he literature pointed out that investigate how sustainability is managed in a more local level, for example, directly with the subsidiaries , would be interesting (Vigneau et al., 2015) , therefore, a next step of this research could be getting in touch with the local offices to try to understand how deeply their work is integrated in the SR process. Other suggestion is the development of com plementary studies to carefully understand th e sustainability integration . As this was qualitative research about integration of sustainability practices and sustainability reporting, considering the GRI guidelines , a quantitative study or a study consider ing another SR framework could contribute to a more holistic point of view of how sustainability is being integrated inside the firms.", "From the findings of this research, can be perceived that sustainability integration still is a challenge for firms, eve n from a highly regulated sector that works a long time with GRI standard in their SR. In addition, there is a continued need of primary data collection and engagement of sustainability professionals in academic research (Sroufe, 2017) and this study contribut es in this matter.", "From the theoretical point of view, this study is contributing while investigating a how question related to integrated sustainability, “relatively little research has been devoted to the processes used to develop the report” (p. 150, S earcy & Buslovich, 2014).

So, we really need to communicate better and these dimensions are an excellent opportunity for us to do this type of communication, so this ha s been the challenge, every year we improve in making efforts, with our vice president who we are connected with, we make a letter with a specific mail to the leader, make a specific letter or a specific email to employees, there is an internal Intranet channel where we publish the report, the link to the report on the website\" how can I say? This goal of being a sustainable company that applies this in its supply chain and such, this cascades into its companies linked to Gama, in this case, and we adopt the same practices and try to seek this performance as well, and then, in relation a (...) through inte rnal communication vehicles, as I mentioned before, to show the commitment that the company has with the UN, right, with the 2030 Agenda, with the SDGs, etc\". how can I talk? An ok from Spain with the answers from Spain, we have a meeting to find out if the numbers are pretty good, if we really spent this on a supplier, for example, local, a supplier that is not, finally, international, if they are all su stainable. We do this analysis together after we do the meeting, we see if we are really aligned, what is missing? And then we align everything with the sustainability and environment sector\". Design Workshops, an agile method, combined with other group work tools, with high potential for engagement and development of those involved\" .", "people understand, in the areas to understand the relevance and also in high leadership. Senior leadership is already more aware, but they need to be more involved in the process, even for (...) finally , even for them to engage in their own areas, got it? This is not something that is just up to us, the sustainability area. So, we need this engagement, this commitment, because, well, it is an activity that demands a lot of time from employees\".", "Employee’s \"Ahh, we do it like this, there is training for employees, focal points, a lot of internal communication, we have also done so, when we launch these indexes, we always try to be more, to do a closer work there with the collaborators for them to understand exactly what they need to submit to have, submit according to the parameters so as not to submit any type of information\". \"I think that we have full adherence from all areas to use this reporting standard and internalize it in management, because then, we have a very good involvement of some areas, especially when top management buys the idea and supports the idea , we have a very good involvement, but we still have those areas that need to be pushed, that still don't understand the three pillars and think that the economic bias is what prevails and doesn't care about the socio -environmental. We \"I think so, because each area that it fills has an executor and a reviewer, generally, the reviewer is the le adership and the executor, it is not mandatory, ok, but usually the executor is one of the analysts. So it kind of answers your question, from the person who goes there to the operational, submits the operations and I speak for my area, the person who puts this input in the system and this is the person who works with it daily, who provides \"So, but employees, they are also stakeholders. So I think the engagement is total, total, total. The company itself encourages awareness in this regard, of size, of transparency, everything you do has to be documented, the company is very very honest, in that sense. (...) S o, I think, as I said, that most people like, trust, precisely because they are not seeing dissonances in what is informed and what really happens in the company. I think that's it, \"After the revisions of the regulations carried out in 2019, face -to-face training was carried out on the topics revised in the Code of Ethics, Compliance and Anti-Corruption Policies for own personnel and leaders, including senior management, who signed the new document. In total, 9,699 own professionals completed training on the subject, which represents 83% of the staff. There was no specific training for suppliers and an e -learning on the topic for 2020 is under development\" .", "stay there giving those hammers so that he wakes up\". support to the suppliers, who create the improvement plan, who get in touch with it, so it is certainly a person who is fully engaged in this topic\". there may be a delay, I won't even say a delay, a problem, maybe, in outso urced workers, because I feel that many outsourced workers, for example, don't really feel part of the company, so, many don't even see the communication, the reports, which end up being sent by e -mail\". Accountability Internal \"I think not everyone knows the GRI, so we have been doing this exercise to raise awareness, to share the methodology and such. So, the focal points they know, yes, all dimensions, they know the parameterization, they know the connection, but I think there is a better work to be done there to raise awareness even about the work of the GRI, maybe, like this, to help more about the importance of these dimensions, why is it important to have this list of dimensions? What are they for? Bring a little more to th is management perspective, in addition to reporting, because reporting is a presentation of accounts. I think the GRI, the methodology goes beyond \"I notice that the report has become more valued now, after the company went public. Peo ple started to give importance to the report when shareholders started sending questions to the investor relations area questioning our numbers, questioning the number of accidents, questioning the oil spill, questioning fuel consumption, because it increa sed by one year for another, when the movement is against it, it has to decrease (...) But I am no longer concerned with making people understand that sustainability is not a social project. I no longer have this concern, I would say \"And, going back to the challenge, it's because, as much as we have this goal, this goal, it doesn't depend 100% on us, so we have to, through improvement plans, meetings with suppliers, show the benefits and etc to make the chain sustainable. I think it's more in this sense, the challenge is very much in this, for us to be able to penetrate the suppliers in order to be able to boost this in them as well. And why not that they also deploy this in their supply chal lenge is very much in this, for us to be able to penetrate the suppliers in order to be able to boost this in them \"Sustainability itself, because we only let people into our company who are sustainable. I think that, in fact, everything we do in purchasing is very important, not only the supplier's management, this part of registration, financial analysis, sustainability, but also the purchasing part itself. We make the company save millionaires, billionaires, because of our sector, because of negotiation, because of all the technical part of the purchases. So, we are an essential sector within the company\". \"Being environmentally sustainable translates into reducing greenhouse gas emis sions and being more efficient in the production and use of energy, as well as complying with environmental legislation and taking advantage of the best international practices related to the subject.

So, it would be very broad, because, for example, only from my processes, I do, for example, supplier registration, financial analysis of suppliers, sustainability management, SOX, so, like, there are many processes, but we , in short, we manage, classify, mitigate the risk of these suppliers, so much so that from the beginning, from the moment of registration, the supplier needs to say ok in our code of conduct, share our code of conduct within their company, it needs send a compliance report, so it is very well tied to the supplier management process\". \"In this direction, we have also made progress in an initiative that we are very proud of: the Electricians School, created to train residents of the communities where we operate, increasing the number of professionals qualified to work in electr ical networks in a safe manner.

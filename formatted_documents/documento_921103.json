Tese (Doutorado em Psiquiatria e Saúde Mental) – Instituto de Psiquiatria da Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, 2022.", "Apesar da idade do diagnóstico dos transtornos mentais variar substancialmente, desde a primeira infância até a idade adulta, a maior parte dos indivíduos diagnosticados com essas condições apresenta modificações das trajetórias normais do neurodesenvolvimento. Sabe-se que as alterações no sistema imune e uma ativação exacerbada das células microgliais, as células imunes do nosso sistema nervoso central (SNC) , além de fatores estressores do ambiente, como o trauma infantil, estão relacionados ao desenvolvimento anômalo do SNC e podem contribuir para o surgimento de psicopatologia na vida adulta. Os pacientes com transtorno de pânico (TP) apresentam uma hiperativação do seu sistema imune, manifestada por meio de concentrações aumentadas de citocinas inflamatórias. Entretanto, pouco se sabe sobre o mecanismo pelo qual o trauma infantil e as alterações inflamatórias podem atuar na fisiopatologia do TP. Dessa forma, o objetivo desta tese foi investigar a possível associação de fatores estressores e da ativação do sistema imune no TP por meio de uma abordagem focada na perspectiva do neurodesenvolvimento. Esta tese é composta por uma coletânea de artigos científicos que relatam estudos realizados pela autora sobre este tema ao longo do curso de doutorado. O primeiro trabalho teve como objetivo avaliar o perfil de citocinas em pacientes com diagnóstico de TP virgens de tratamento. Um aumento nas concentrações de citocinas inflamatórias, representradas pela interleucina (IL)-1B e IL-2R, e uma redução na citocina anti-inflamatória, IL-10, foi observado em pacientes com TP virgens de tratamento, evidenciando que tais marcadores exercem alguma influência no início desse quadro clínico. Foram estudadas hipóteses sobre o que ocasiona um aumento dos níveis de citocinas inflamatórias. Uma das possibilidades discutidas é de que estressores precoces na infância podem atuar na microglia, ativan do o complexo inflamassoma microglial NLRP3, contribuindo para a produção de citocinas inflamatórias e radicais livres. Dessa forma, o segundo artigo desta tese investigou se o trauma infantil se relaciona a um aumento de citocinas inflamatórias nos pacientes com TP. Foi verificado que, particularmente, o abuso físico na infância resulta em maiores níveis de IL-2R nos pacientes com TP. Ademais, no terceiro manuscrito verificou-se que pacientes com TP virgens de tratamento, apresentavam aumento da IL-1B e de marcadores de estresse oxidativo, além d o abuso sexual ser um preditor de níveis aumentados de IL-1B em pacientes com TP virgens de tratamento. Além disso, foi feita uma meta-análise que incluiu estudos com roedores, no qual foi verificado que a ativação imune materna durante a gestação pode contribuir para o desenvolvimento de ansiedade na prole. Ademais, foi investigado se filhos de pacientes com diagnóstico de TP também apresentam alterações nos seus níveis de citocinas inflamatórias, sendo que isso não foi verificado no quinto trabalho desta tese . Apesar disso, os filhos dos pacientes com transtornos de ansiedade são um grupo de risco para o desenvolvimento de sintomas psiquiátricos. Dessa forma, o sexto manuscrito consistiu em uma revisão sistemática da literatura sobre os principais pródromos observados na prole de pais ansiosos . Esse último estudo corrobora a ideia de que os mecanismos pelos quais a ansiedade dos pais atua na prole apresenta resultados diferentes, conforme características do indivíduo e do meio em que ele está inserido. Dessa forma, exist em diversos desfechos possíveis diante de um mesmo processo do desenvolvimento dependendo dos fatores genéticos, estímulos ambientais e processos de resiliência de cada pessoa. Essa ideia é amparada pela teoria de que os transtornos mentais não são necessariamente categorias distintas, mas sim trajetórias desenvolvimentais dimensionais. Dessa maneira, o sétimo, o oitavo e o nono manuscritos desta tese consistiram em revisões sistemáticas sob uma perspectiva transdiagnóstica: é descrito como as citocinas devem ser percebidas de um ponto de vista transdiagnóstico, uma vez que discute alterações desses marcadores inflamatórios no suicídio; foi verificado que o teste de inalação ao gás carbônico, um experimento comumente associado ao TP, pode ser visto de uma maneira espectral e, estudou-se os mais comuns biomarcadores periféricos que estão presentes nos mais variados transtornos mentais. Uma compreensão do TP orientada para o desenvolvimento das trajetórias dessa condição é essencial tanto para a previsão de risco personalizada quanto para a inovação de tratamentos. Isso pode resultar em estratégias preventivas para tal condição, diminuindo o ônus que esse transtorno representa para os pacientes, seus familiares e para a sociedade.", "Palavras-chave: ansiedade; biomarcadores; microglia; sistema imune; transtornos do neurodesenvolvimento, pesquisa médica translacional, transtorno de pânico. ABSTRACT QUAGLIATO, Laiana Azevedo. O papel do estresse e da inflamação na fisiopatologia do transtorno de pânico sob a luz do neurodesenvolvimento. 2022. Tese (Doutorado em Saúde Mental) – Instituto de Psiquiatria, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, 2022.", "Although the age of diagnosis of mental disorders varies substantially, from infancy to adulthood, most individuals diagnosed with these conditions present changes in the normal trajectories of neurodevelopment. Modifications in the immune system and an exacerbated activation of microglial cells, the immune cells of our central nervous system (CNS), in addition to environmental stressors such as childhood trauma, are related to the anomalous development of the CNS and may contribute to the emergence of psychopathology in adult life. Patients with panic disorder (PD) have a hyperactivated immune system, manifested by increased concentrations of inflammatory cytokines. However, we know little about the mechanism by which childhood trauma and inflammatory changes may act in the pathophysiology of PD. Thus, the goal of this thesis was to look into the probable link between stresses and immune system activation in PD using a neurodevelopmental approach. This thesis is composed of a series of articles that report on the author's graduate school research on this issue. The first study was to assess the cytokine profile of treatment-naive PD patients. In treatment-naive PD patients, there was an increase in the concentrations of inflammatory cytokines, represented by interleukin (IL)-1B and IL-2R, and a decrease in the anti-inflammatory cytokine, IL-10, indicating that such markers have some influence on the onset of this clinical picture. Hypotheses about what causes a rise in inflammatory cytokine levels were investigated. Early stressors in childhood, for example, may act on microglia, activating the microglial inflammasome complex NLRP3, contributing to the generation of inflammatory cytokines and free radicals. As a consequence, the second paper in this thesis evaluated whether childhood trauma is associated with an increase in inflammatory cytokines in PD patients. Physical maltreatment in childhood, in particular, has been linked to greater levels of IL-2R in PD patients. Furthermore, it was discovered in the third study that treatment-naive PD patients exhibited elevated IL-1B and oxidative stress markers concentrations, and that sexual abuse was a predictor of elevated IL-1B levels in treatment-naive PD patients. Additionally, a meta-analysis that included rodent research was performed, and it was verified that maternal immune activation during pregnancy can contribute to the development of anxiety in offspring . Furthermore, whether offspring of patients with PD have changes in their levels of inflammatory cytokines was explored, however this was not confirmed in the fifth work of this thesis. Despite this, children of anxiety disorder patients are at risk of developing psychiatric symptoms. Thus, the sixth manuscript consisted of a systematic review of the literature on the main prodromes observed in the offspring of anxious parents. This last study supports the idea that the mechanisms by which parental anxiety acts on the offspring present different results according to the characteristics of the individual and the environment in which he is inserted. Thus, in the face of the same developmental process, there are various different outcomes based on each person's genetic components, environmental stressors, and resilience processes. The theory that mental diseases are not necessarily distinct categories, but rather dimensional developmental pathways, lends support to this idea. Thus, the seventh, eighth, and ninth manuscripts of this thesis consisted of systematic reviews from a transdiagnostic perspective; one describes how cytokines should be perceived from a transdiagnostic point of view, as it discusses changes in these inflammatory markers in suicide; another verified that the carbon dioxide inhalation test, an experiment commonly associated with PD, can be seen in a spectral way; and in other work the most common peripheral biomarkers that are present in the most varied mental disorders were studied. An understanding of PD aimed toward the development of disease trajectories is required for both customized risk prediction and therapy innovation. This can lead to preventive efforts for this problem, minimizing the burden it places on patients, their families, and society.", "Keywords: anxiety; biomarkers; microglia; imune system; neurodevelopmental disorders, translational medical research, panic disorder.", "SUMÁRIO", "2.1.

A PRESENTAÇÃO", "A minha formação como pesquisadora se iniciou quando ingressei no mestrado do Programa de Pós -Graduação em Psiquiatria e Saúde Mental do Instituto de Psiquiatria (IPUB) da Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ) sob a orientação do Profe ssor Antonio Egidio Nardi. Nes se período aprendi a sistematizar a minha curiosidade no modelo da metodologia científica e fui incentivada pelo Prof. Nardi a realizar novos questionamentos a cada dia que se passava.", "No meu mestrado, verificamos que os pacientes com diagnóstico de transtorno de pânico (TP) que realizavam tratamento ambulatorial no Laboratório de Pânico e Respiração (LABPR) apresentavam um au mento do marcador inflamatóri o IL-2R e que essa molécula predizia um aumento da atividade da via da quinurenina em pacientes com diagnóstico de TP , mas não nos controles saudáveis (QUAGLIATO; FREIRE; NARDI, 2019) . As citocinas inflamatórias, como a interleucina ( IL)-2R, apresentam capacidade de induzir a enzima indolamina -2,3-dioxigenase (IDO), que catalisa a etapa de limitação da síntese da quinurenina advinda do triptofano (SCHWARCZ et al., 2012) . Essa enzima localiza -se majoritariamente em células microgliais, as células imunes do nosso sistema nervoso central (SCH WARCZ et al., 2012) . Dessa forma, uma maior indução da enzima IDO poderia se relacionar a uma ativação das células microgliais e, consequentemente, na produção de citocinas, como a IL -2R, por essas células , que atuariam em um feedback positivo, mantendo a atividade da enzima IDO aumentada (CAPURON; MILLER, 2011) . A figura 1 ilustra a relação entre a IL -2R e a enzima IDO.", "18Figura 1- A enzima IDO, localizada na célula microglial, catalisa a limitação da síntese da quinurenina advinda do triptofano e está relacionada a uma maior produção de citocinas inflamatórias, como a IL -2R, pelas células microgliais. Essa enzima é induzida pela IL -2R e colabora para a maior produção desse marcador pela micróglia, acarretando em um mecanism o de feedback positivo .", "Os achados do meu mestrado resultaram em seis artigos científicos (QUAGLIATO; NARDI, 2018a, 2018b; QUAGLIATO; FREIRE; NARDI, 2018a, 2018b, 2019; QUAGLIATO et al., 2019 ) que foram publicados em revistas qualis A1 e A2 , além de eu ter sido agraciada com o Prêmio Austregésilo da Academia Nacional de Medicina. Entretanto, o principal fruto do meu mestrado foi o surgimento de novos questionamentos referentes ao papel das células da glia no TP que originaram os trabalhos qu e compõem es ta tese .", "1.2. OS TRANSTORNOS MENTAIS E O NEURODESENVOLVIMENTO", "Os transtornos mentais são condições que apresentam continuidade significativa ao longo da vida, causando sofrimento pessoal e familiar importante, prejuízos funcionais, além de grande custo social (ANNE et al., 2014; AGORASTOS et al., 2019 ). Essas patologias figuram entre as principais causas de incapacidade e estão fortemente assoc iadas aos motivos majoritários de mortalidade entre os jovens, além de reduzirem a expectativa de vida de maneira independente (GREEN BERG et al., 2015; KONNOPKA; KÖNIG, 2020) .", "Apesar da busca pelo substrato biológico dos transtornos mentais ser necessária para o desenvolvimento de terapias mais eficazes e, sobretudo, de 19estratégias preventivas através do diagnóstico precoce, as ten tativas experimentais para identificar marcadores específicos para os diferentes transtornos permanecem sem sucesso (KIM -COHEN et al., 2003) . Dessa forma, os tratamentos atuais são baseados em sintomas, não sendo modificadores da doença e apresentando baixas taxas de resposta (CUTHBERT; INSEL, 2013) . Tais resultados negativos r esultam, ao menos em parte, de uma provável falta de especificidade de alterações globais da biologia cerebral para determinados quadros clínicos (BOSKER et al., 2011) . De fato, o s próprios sintomas e manifestações clínicas são em si inespecíficos para os diferentes transtornos (CUTHBERT; INSEL, 2013) . Além disso, estudos genéticos mostram que uma mesma alteração genética pode aumentar o risco para diferentes transtornos, como o TP e o transtorno depressivo maior (MOSING et al., 2009) . Depressão e ansiedade comumente coocorrem e raramente são diagnosticados isoladamente (TAPOROSKI et al. , 2015) . Há uma falta de especificidade fenotípica observada na clínica, encontrando -se, por exemplo, um excesso de indivíduos com transtornos do humor em familiares de pacientes com ansiedade (MATHER et al., 2016) . Supõe -se daí que uma base genética comum pode estar ligada a s mesmas anomalias da estrutura e da função ce rebral nes ses transtornos (MATHER et al., 2016) . Estes dados compelem à adoção de estratégias experimentais que considerem tanto as diferenças como as similaridades biológicas entre os diferentes diagnósticos. A racional desta estratégia é que uma base genética confere uma vulnerabilidade comum para distúrbios da maturação, da plasticidade e d e funções cerebrais. A in teração desta base genética com fatores não -genéticos determinará a patoplastia e as variedades das manifestações clínicas.", "Um ponto em comum dos diversos transtornos mentais é o fato de a maioria deles surgir de alterações das trajetórias normais do neur odesenvolvimento, apesar da idade d o diagnóstico clinico variar substancialmente, desde a primeira infância até a idade adulta (WHELAN et al., 2015) . A ca racterização do neurodesenvolvimento normal e das trajetórias e processos desviantes t êm sido o objetivo de um grande número de estudos realizados nos últimos anos que buscam elucidar as origens dos transtornos mentais (CUTHBERT; INSEL, 2013) . Essa abordagem é baseada em hipóteses e evidênci as empíricas de que os transtornos mentais são o resultado de processos anormais do neurodesenvolvimento que iniciam e operam muito antes que se manifestem por meio de alterações comportamentais, cognitivas ou emocionais 20(BALE, 2015) . Subjacentes ao seu surgimento estão estressores ambientais em interações complexas com fatores genéticos operando durante o período intrauterino ou os primeiros anos de vida (CASPI et al., 1996) .", "As células gliais, representadas por microglias, astrócitos e oligodendrócitos, influenciam os principais aspectos do neurodesenvolvimento, plasticidade e função das sinapses, m odificando a circuitaria neuronal (LEE; CHUNG, 2019) . No cérebro saudável e em desenvolvimento, a glia secreta marcadores in flamatórios, como citocinas, que induzem a formação de sinapses e a modulação da transmissão sináptica e plasticidade (MÜLLER; SCHWARZ, 2007) . Especificamente durante a neurogênese, células da glia radial derivadas de células neuroepiteliais, atuam como precursores para a formação de neurônios, astrócitos, oligodendrócitos e células - tronco neurais adultas e orientam a migração de neurônios imaturos para sua localização final no sistema nervoso central ( SNC ) (SCHWARZ; SHOLAR; BILBO, 2012) . Para que esse processo ocorra são necessárias citocinas, particularmente moléculas da família glicoproteína 130/IL -6 e da superfamília transforming growth fator (TGF)-β (ELOVITZ et al., 2011) . Além disso, quimiocinas, como o CXCL12, promovem a migração e proliferação dos neurônios recém -gerados e desempenham um papel importante na localização axonal dentro do SNC (WECKMAN et al., 2019) . Não apenas as citocinas atuam durante a neurogênese, como também a microglia, células imunes do nosso SNC (TAY; CARRIER; TREMBLAY, 2019) . Durante o período embrionário de formação do SNC, as células microgliais são as primeiras células a migrar para essa região (TAY; CARRIER; TREMBLAY, 2019) . Na embriogênese, a microglia guia neurônios e seus axônios para formar circuitos neurais pré-natais (TAY; CARRIER; TREMBLAY, 2019) . No decorrer do desenvolvimento pós -natal, a microglia modula a poda sináptic a (WU et al., 2015) . Essa atividade é realizada pelo fagocitose de espinhas dendríticas que não receberam entradas sinápticas (WU et al., 2015) . Dessa forma, a m icroglia refina e esculpe os circuitos sinápticos , removendo o excesso de conexões sinápticas (SCHAFER et al., 2012) . Está bem documentado que a disfunção e a perda de sinapses podem ocorrer muito antes de quaisquer sinais de psicopatologia e comprometimento co gnitivo de um transtorno mental (HOWES; MCCUTCHEON, 2017) . Durante o neurodesenvolvimento, as citocinas e seus receptores são expressos por todo o cérebro fetal e atuam em processos envolvidos na 21sobrevivência, proliferação e diferenciação celular, crescimento axonal e sinaptogênese (ZHOU, 2015) . Variações n as concentrações de citocinas e na ativação micro glial, portanto, têm um forte potencial para alterar as trajetórias do desenvolvimento neurológico.", "As células microgliais são particularmente vulneráveis a lesões ou toxinas (SOMERA -MOLINA et al., 2009) . Como as únicas células imunes residentes no SNC, a microglia age como uma primeira resposta a insultos endógenos e exógenos que aparecem no cérebro (SOMERA -MOLINA et al., 2009) . Ao vigiar o parênquima, a microglia adota um estado morfológico definido por uma morfologia ramificada e processos altamente móveis que permitem maximizar a eficiência e a área total monitorada por cada célula (TAY; CARRIER; TREMBLAY, 2019) . Após o reconhecim ento de uma toxina ou um sinal de estresse no microambiente do SNC que estava sendo vigiado pela microglia, essa célula adquire um fenótipo ativo definido por uma morfologia amebóide (TAY; CARRIER; TREMBLAY, 2019) . Nes sa morfologia, a microglia produz citocinas inflamatórias e espécies reativas de oxigênio (ROS) (TAY; CARRIER; TREMBLAY, 2019) . A microglia ativada contribui para funções homeostáticas que incluem a poda sináptica durante o desenvolvimento, a morte programada de neurônios e a depuração de material patogênico ou tóxico do SNC (TAY; CARRIER; TREMBLAY, 2019) . No entanto, a ativação persistente da microglia produz um ambiente neurotóxico ao promover neuroinflamação em excesso, poda sináptica desregulada e perda da arquitetura sináptica (WU et al., 2015) . A ativação persistente da microglia está presente em pacientes diagnosticados com uma variedade de transtornos mentais, incluindo esquizofrenia, transtorno do espectro autista e transtorno depressivo maior (HONG; DISSING -OLESEN; STEVENS, 2016; SEKAR et al., 2016) .", "1.3. A ORIGEM DESENVOLVIMENTAL DOS TRANSTRONOS MENTAIS", "Diversos fatores podem contribuir para a s alterações dos níveis de citocinas e para uma ativação das células gliais durante a embriogênese ou durante o neurodesenvolvimento da criança. Visto que muitos transtornos psiquiátricos supostamente têm origens no neurodesenvolvimento, as características do ambiente inicial, começando no útero ou mesmo antes, podem representar os principais fatores de risco para o surgimento de problemas mentais para o indivíduo (SECKL;", "22HOLMES, 2007; GLUCKMAN; HANSON, 2008; GLUCKMAN et al., 2008;", "GLUCKMAN; HANSON; LOW, 2011; HANSON; GLUCKMAN, 2011) . A “hipótese d a programação fetal ” (SECKL; HOLMES, 2007) , a “hipótese d a programação de desenvolvimento ” (LANGLEY -EVANS, 2006, 2015) e a “hipótese das origens do desenvolvimento da saúde e da d oença ” (GILLMAN, 2005) afirmam que, durante períodos críticos ou sensíveis de desenvolvimento, perturbaç ões nos fatores ambientais, como a restrição de nutrientes, a exposição à glicocorticóides, a s infecções e o estresse psicossocial t êm um efeito organizacional nos sistemas biológicos do feto, que ao longo do desenvolvimento irá reagir e se adaptar às influências ambientais. Essas hipóteses sugerem que sinais intrauterinos \"programam\" o desenvolvimento do feto de uma maneira que o predispõe para consequências de saúde específicas (FLEMING; VELAZQUEZ; EC KERT, 2015) . Essa ideia indica que a qualidade do desenvolvimento fetal molda as diferenças individuais no risco de doenças crônicas ao longo da vida (DICKINSON et al., 2016) . A hipótese das origens desenvolvimentais dos transtornos mentais está particu larmente associada ao sistema imune (SUN; VELAZQUEZ; FLEMING, 2015) . Por exemplo, h á muito se sabe que as infecções in utero podem alterar o cérebro fetal, variando de problemas comportamentais leves a déficits graves (MALEK, 2013) . Infecções maternas ativas com o o vírus herpes simplex, o citomegalovírus, a rubéola e a toxoplasmose podem causar deficiência intelectual na prole e dificuldades de aprendizagem (SHERIDAN, 1964; WILSON et al., 1980; CONBOY et al., 1987; ENGMAN et al., 2008) . Não apenas as infeções podem originar consequências na prole , a obesidade, o diab etes gestacional e o estresse psicossocial durante a gestação são fatores que sabidamente aumentam o nível de citocinas inflamatórias nas mães e podem trazer consequências para os seus filhos (TAMASHIRO et al., 2009; TAMASHIRO; MORAN, 2010 ; PARK; JANG; BOURET, 2020 ). Sendo assim, a ativação do sistema imune durante a gestação se relaciona a consequências comportamentais e déficits na prole. Entretanto, e m humanos, nem sempre os descendentes de mães que apresentaram uma ativação do seu sistema imune durante a gestação, possu em algum transtorno menta l. Assim, atualmente , existem evidências de que é necessár ia a exposição a mais de um fator de risco para o desenvolvimento de transtornos psiquiátricos (DAVIS et al., 2016; HEINEMANN et al., 2016; VERSTRAETEN et al., 2019) .", "23A exposição à ativação imune intraútero parece agir como um \"gatilho para doença s\", atuando de modo a tornar um indivíduo mais suscetível aos efeitos de mutações genéticas e posteriores exposições ambientais , com o consequente desencadeamento de sintomas relacionados a os transtornos mentais mais tarde na vida (VERSTRAETEN et al., 2019) . Pode -se especular que a exposição a um estado inflamatório elevado na vida pré -natal pode “preparar” o cérebro , sensibili zando as células microgliais, levando à vulnerabilidade (WILLIAMSON et al., 2011) . Esse estado de vulnerabilidade faz com que as células microgliais estejam mais suscetíveis a responder de maneira exacerbada , caso ocorra um novo fator estressor (WILLIAMSON et al., 2011) . Particularmente, o estado de vulnerabilidade pode ser expresso, por exemplo, como c onectividade cerebral interrompida por meio de poda sináptica alterada (SEKAR et al., 2016) . Outros estressores durante o desenvolvimento da criança , como maus -tratos na infância, bullying no período da adolesc ência , transições de vida estressantes, dentre outras , podem auxiliar na conversão da vulnerabilidade em de sordem (DANESE; LEWIS, 2017) . Dessa forma, apenas quando a combinação de fatores de risco genéticos e ambientais são associados com inflamação in utero , a trajetória de desenvolvimento do indivíduo muda em direção a um resultado final de manifestações psicopatológicas.", "1.4. O TRAUMA DURANTE A INFÂNCIA E A MICROGLIA", "Maus-tratos infantis são os abusos e negligências que ocorrem em crianças menores de 18 anos de idade. Essa definição i nclui todos os tipos de maus -tratos físicos e/ou emocionais, abuso sexual, negligência e exploração comercial ou outra, que resulte em dan o real ou potencial à saúde, sobrevivência, desenvolvimento ou dignidade da criança no contexto de uma relação de responsabilidade, confiança ou poder (FALASCA; CAULFIELD, 1999) .", "O trauma infantil tem graves consequências para suas vítimas e para a sociedade (HAMBY et al., 2021) . A experiência de maus -tratos na infância aumenta significativamente o risco de desenvolvimento de transtornos psiquiátricos na vida adulta (MYERS et al., 2015) . Traumas infantis, em particular aqueles que são interpessoais, intencionais e crônicos, estão associadas a maiores taxas de transtorno de estresse pós -traumático, depressão, ansiedade e maior risco de desenvolver transtorno s por uso de substâncias (ELLASON; ROSS, 1997; HEFFERNAN et al., 242000 ; DVIR; DENIETOLIS; FRAZIER, 2013 ). Ainda nã o se sabe de que maneira os maus -tratos na infância contribuem para o desenvolvimento de transtornos mentais na vida adulta, mas hipotetiza -se que isso esteja associado a ativação da microglia (DANESE; LEWIS, 2017) .", "Evidências mostram que o trauma infantil contribui para altera ções nas células microglia is e isso, consequentemente, altera o desenvolvimento normal do SNC (DANESE; LEWIS, 2017) . O trauma infantil causa elevação sustentada d e cortisol (SUZUKI et al., 2014) . A microglia expressa altos níveis do receptor de glicocorticóide . Dessa forma, níveis aumentados de corti sol aumentam o número de células microgliais e a atividade fagocítica dessas células , além de levar a alterações de longo prazo na reatividade microglial (JOHNSON; KAFFMAN, 2018) . Ademais , a microglia é fundamental para guiar vários processos de desenvolvimento neuronal e não neuronal que podem se apresentar de maneira anômala em pessoas que sofreram traumas infantis , incluindo: neurogênese, sinaptogênese, poda sináptica, crescimento axonal, maturação de astrócitos, mielinização e integridade da barreira hematoencefálica (JOHNSON; KAFFMAN, 2018) . Em outras palavras, os maus -tratos na infância promovem mudanças na função microglial o que permite explicar , ao menos parcialmente, como o trauma infantil modifica a circuitária neuronal e pode contribuir para o desenvolvimento de transtornos mentais (JOHNSON; KAFFMAN, As classificações referentes a traumas na infância são heterogêneas (KIRA, 2001) . Na presente tese foi adotada a divisão dos maus -tratos vividos na infância em cinco dimensões, de acordo com a definição de Bernstein et al. (2003) . Essas dimensões f oram contempladas no questionário clínico conhecido como Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ) – que foi traduzido e validado para a língua portuguesa, como Questionário sobre Traumas na Infância (QUESI) (GRASSI -OLIVEIRA; STEIN; -abuso emocional: agressões verbais ou qualquer comportamento humilhante ou degradante dirigido a uma criança por um adulto ou uma pessoa mais velha; -abuso físico: agressões físicas causadas a uma criança por um adulto ou pessoa mais velha com potencial d e causar ferimento; -abuso sexual: contato ou conduta sexual entre pessoa menor de 18 anos e um adulto ou pessoa mais velha; -negligência emocional: falha dos cuidadores em suprir as necessidades emocionais e psicológicas básicas de uma criança, inclusi ve amor, pertencimento, cuidado e apoio; e -negligência física: falha dos cuidadores em suprir cuidados físicos básicos de uma criança, inclusive alimentação, abrigo, vestimenta, segurança e cuidados de saúde.", "Segundo uma metan álise recente, o Brasil é o país com as maiores estimativas de maus -tratos contra crianças no mundo (VIOLA et al., 2016) . Nes se estudo, foram pesquisados dados de abuso sexual, f ísico, emocional e neglig ência f ísica e emocional publicados em cerca de 30 pa íses e observou -se que a Europa e a Ásia estavam associadas às estimativas mais baixas de trauma infantil e a Am érica do Sul apresentava as mais altas entre os continentes (VIOLA et al., 2016) . Maus -tratos na infância causam prejuízo s no desenvolvimento do sistema nervoso (DANESE; LEWIS, 2017) . Ademais, o estresse crônico repetido pode resultar em várias reações biológicas , inclui ndo um estado de medo persistente (AGORASTOS et al., 2019) . As crianças com uma resposta persistente ao medo podem perder sua capacidade de diferenciar entre perigo e segurança, e podem identificar uma ameaça em uma situaçã o não ameaçadora (AGORASTOS et al., 2019) . A interpretação de estímulos neutros como ameaçadores é uma das principais características dos transtornos ansiosos, dentre eles o TP (GODDARD, 2017) .", "1.5. O TRANSTORNO DE P ÂNICO", "O TP é classificado pelo Manual Diagnóstico e Estatístico de Transtornos Mentais (DSM), quinta edição como um do s transtornos de ansiedade, sendo caracterizado po r ataques de pânico (AP) recorrentes (AMERICAN PSYCHIATRIC ASSOCIATION, 2013). O s AP são paroxismo s súbito s de ansiedade nos quai s os sintoma s atinge m um pico e diminue m em pouco s minutos. Pacientes co m TP possuem, ainda, medo de te r um novo AP (ansiedade antecipatória ) e uma mudança no comportamento e m função da presença de AP (sintoma s de evitação) (AMERICAN PSYCHIATRIC ASSOCIATION, 2013). O TP apresenta alto ônus para a sociedade, 26sendo estimado como a 27ª causa de carga global de doença s não fatais no mundo, correspondendo a 1,2% do total dos anos vividos com invalidez (KONNOPKA; KÖNIG, Inibidores seletivos de recaptação da serotonina e benzodiazepínicos são algumas das medicações que apresentam eficácia comprovada no tratamento do TP (ANDREWS et al., 2018) . Entretanto, estudos demonstra m que aproximadamente 50% dos pacientes com TP continuam a apresentar sintomas ansiosos, apesar do tratamento farmacológico e psicoterápico (PERNA; CALDIROLA, 2017) . Sendo assim, podemos con siderar que um subgrupo de pacientes com diagnóstico de TP apresenta uma cronificação de seu quadro clínico.", "Fatores determinantes para o surgimento do TP ainda não foram completamente elucidados. Indivíduos diagnosticados com TP, de maneira geral, possue m uma percepção elevada de perigo ou ameaça (BENKE et al., 2018) . Evidências mostram que no TP ocorrem alterações do desenvolvimento cerebral em circuitos relacionados ao medo (BENKE et al., 2018) . Fatores de base genética, além de modelos neuroquímicos, como o modelo serototinérgico, noradrenérgico e gabaérgico estão entre as hipóteses etiológicas mais difundidas para o TP (GODDARD, 2017) . Recentemente, foi descrito que pacientes com diagnóstico de TP de longa data apresentavam alterações nos seus níveis de citocinas periféricas circulantes, bem como uma hiperativação do seu sistema imune. (QUAGLIATO; FREIRE; NARDI, 2019) .", "Alterações no sistema imune estão relacionad as a hipóteses de que os transtornos mentais possuem uma origem desenvolvimental (REDDAWAY; BRYDGES, 2020) .

Entretanto, pouco se sabe sobre o t rauma infantil e alterações no sistema imune e m pacientes com diagnóstico de TP , particularmente no início do seu quadro clínico . Como um subgrupo de pacientes com diagnóstico de TP apresenta uma cronificação do seu quadro clínico e essa condição é responsável por grande ônus para a sociedade, estabelecer fatores associados a o desenvolvimento do TP é imprescindível. I sso pode resultar em estratégias preventivas para essa condição, diminuindo o ônus que esse transtorno representa para os pacientes, seus familiares e para a sociedade.", "27Dessa forma, considerando:", "a)a relação entre maus -tratos infantis com a ativação do sistema imune e com os mais diversos transtornos mentais; b)a identificação de que pacientes crônicos com diagnóstico de TP apresentam alterações nos seus níveis de citocinas inflamatórias ; c)a necessidade de identificação precoce de indivíduos de risco para o TP a fim de viabilizar estratégias que busquem diagnósticos e tratamentos precoce s para os mesmos, visando a não cronificação do transtorn o, torna -se impreterível que se investigue o mecanismo pelo qual o trauma infantil e as alterações inflamatóri as podem atuar na fisiopatologia do TP, bem como avaliar se a ativação do sistema imune em diferentes fases da vida pode contribuir para um maior risco de desenvolver esse transtorno. Dessa forma, o objetivo des ta tese foi investigar a possível associação de fatores estressores e da ativação do sistema imune no TP por meio de uma abordagem focada na perspectiva do neuro desenvolvimento.

Por fim, discorreremos sobre a inflamação em outros transtornos mentais (manuscrito 7) e a natureza espectral dos transtornos psiquiátri cos (manuscritos 8 e 9).", "2.DESENVOLVIMENTO", "2.1. O PERFIL DAS CITOCINAS NO INÍCIO DO QUADRO DO TRANSTORNO DE", "PÂNICO Um fator importante associado a um risco aumentado de transtornos mentais é a inflamação (VOGELZANGS et al., 2013; CALCIA et al., 2016). Evidências mostram que não apenas a microglia está persistentemente ativada em pacientes com transtornos mentais, mas também alterações periféricas nos níveis de citocinas inflamatórias foram observadas em diversas condições psiquiátricas, dentre elas, o transtorno depressivo maior, o transtorno do espectro autista, a esquizofrenia e os transtornos de ansiedade (VOGELZANGS et al., 2013; DAHAN et al., 2018; EFTEKHARIAN et al., 2018; HIMMERICH et al., 2019) . Estudos demonstram um aumento das citocinas inflamatórias e uma redução nos níveis de marcadores anti- inflamatórios nesses transtornos (MILLER; RAISON, 2016; LEE; GIULIANI, 2019) . O nível de citocinas periféricas pode estar aumentado devido a produção desses marcadores pelas células da microglia com consequente passagem para a periferia , ou devido a elevação da concentração desses marcadores na periferia e a sua passagem para o SNC (GUMUSOGLU et al., 2017). As citocinas podem passar da periferia para o SNC, ou o inverso, por meio de órgãos circunventriculares, áreas no cérebro nas quais as citocinas podem atravessar por meio de difusão simples ou por um sistema de transporte saturável (HUANG; HUSSAIN; CHANG, 2021). Ademais, as citocinas podem danificar a barreira hematoencefálica e aumentar sua permeabilidade, facilitando a passagem desses marcadores inflamatórios (HUANG; HUSSAIN; CHANG, 2021). Dessa forma, tanto a ativação da microglia desencadeia a produção de citocinas, quanto citocinas da periferia podem adentrar o SNC e contribuir para a ativação das células microgliais (SOMERA-MOLINA et al., 2009). A investigação de anormalidades do sistema imunológico em transtornos psiquiátricos se tornou uma área de pesquisa popular na última década (BENROS et al., 2013; VOGELZANGS et al., 2013; UGUZ et al., 2014). Avanços na biologia molecular e genética levaram à identificação de associações entre genes envolvidos na regulação do sistema imunológico e a um aumento do risco de desenvolvimento de transtornos mentais como esquizofrenia, transtorno do espectro autista, transtorno bipolar, transtorno depressivo maior e TP (MICHEL; SCHMIDT; MIRNICS, 2012;BUFALINO et al., 2013; FOLDAGER et al., 2014). Ademais, alguns estudos sugerem 28 29que o tratamento adjuvante de determinados transtornos mentais, como o transtorno depressivo maior, com agentes imunomoduladores pode estar associado à melhora na sintomat ologia (SOLMI et al., 2017) . Tomados em conjunto, esses achados sugerem que precisamos avaliar mais extensivamente a hipótese de que a disfunção imunológica manifestada por um aumento nos biomarcadores pró -inflamatórios e uma diminuição nos biomarcadores anti-inflamatórios pode estar envolvida na patogênese dos principais transtornos mentais em alguns indivíduos.", "Estudos recentes realizados pelo nosso grupo evidenciaram níveis aumentados de citocinas inflamatórias em pacientes com o diagnóstico de TP (QUAGLIATO; NARDI, 2018b; QUAGLIATO; FREIRE; NARDI, 2019) . Entretanto, esses estudos foram conduzidos em pacientes realizando tratamento medicamentoso e/ou psicoterápico. Segundo o nosso conhecimento, até o momento, nenhum estudo avaliou os níveis de citocinas em pacientes com TP virgens de tratamento. Portanto, pouco se sabe sobre alterações nos níveis de citocinas inflamatórias e anti - inflamatórias no início deste distúrbio. Dessa forma, realizamos o primeiro estudo que visa identificar o perfil de citocinas em pacientes com TP virgens de tratamento. 302.1.1.

Zip code: 22270 -902. laiana.quagliato@gmail.com", "32ABSTRACT", "Although accumulating evidence suggests that inflammatory processes play a role in the pathophysiology of mental disorders, few studies have investigated this matter in panic disorder (PD). Furthermore, no studies to date have evaluated cytokine levels in drug-naïve patients with PD. Therefore, little is known about the presence of inflammation at the onset of this disorder. The aim of the present study was to determine the levels of the proinflammatory interleukins IL -1B and IL -2R and the anti- inflammatory cytokine IL -10 in drug -naïve PD patients. Analysis of serum chemokine levels revealed increased proinflammatory activity in the early phase of PD through increased IL -2R and IL -1B levels and a decrease in IL -10 levels in drug -naïve PD patients c ompared to matched healthy controls. Neurotransmitters and neurocircuits that are targets of inflammatory responses are discussed , followed by an examination of brain –immune interactions as risk factors for PD. This study is the first to identify a proinfl ammatory cytokine response in drug -naïve PD subjects. These findings indicate that treatments targeting proinflammatory markers may ameliorate anxiety symptoms in PD patients.", "INTRODUCTION Panic disorder (PD) is a chronic mental condition marked by frequent and unexpected panic episodes, as well as persistent concern about panic attacks and their repercussions. PD affects 22.7% of the global population1. As a result, PD significantly impacts people's quality of life and functioning1. The neurobiology underlying PD is unknown, and existing pharmaceutical treatments are often ineffective at keeping patients in remission or enhancing their quality of life2. A higher frequency of panic attacks has been associated with greater risk of recurrence, severity, and long-term consequences, emphasizing the significance of seeking early treatment3. In this context, greater knowledge of the pathophysiology of early-stage PD is crucial for enhancing treatment options and, ultimately, patient outcomes.", "The intensity and recurrence of panic attacks have been correlated with changes in immunological markers4. Compared with remitted PD, current PD was associated with higher mean levels of inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6 and IL-1B4. Peripherally generated proinflammatory cytokines can pass the blood-brain barrier, and peripheral proinflammatory signals can be actively propagated across the blood-brain barrier through crosstalk between the peripheral and central immune systems5,6. Although inflammatory interleukins have been associated with PD, the pathophysiological mechanisms by which these mediators might contribute to panic symptoms remain unknown. In particular, peripheral cytokines can change amygdala activity and increase anxiety-like behavi or7. The amygdala, the focal point for fear processing, has been associated with the etiology of PD and panic attacks. Greater inflammation has been linked to greater activation in threat and anxiety-related neurocircuitry, including the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, insula, and amygdala, based on functional magnetic resonance imaging studies7–9 An imbalance between inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines has been reported in several mental health disorders, including PD4. However, to date, the cytokine profile of drug-naïve individuals with PD has not been investigated. Thus, the aim of this study was to assess the inflammatory cytokines IL-1B and IL-2R and the anti-inflammatory marker IL-10 in a sample of drug-naïve adults with PD and matched controls.", "METHODS Study design and participants This was a cross-sectional stud y with a matched sample of drug-naïve young adults. For this study, drug-naïve subject s with PD (n = 38 ) were selected. The inclusion criteria fo r the PD group were a s follows: individual s were (1 ) diagnosed with PD and (2)self-re ported no lifetime psychiatri c medication use (drug-naïve statu s) and no current o r past psychotherapy. The drug-naïve statu s wa s defined a s no receipt of psychotropi c medication s or psychotherap y in a lifetime a s demonstrated by universal electronic medical record s and confirmed b y the patient’ s interview. A health y control group wa s also recruited (n = 38). The inclusion criteria fo r the health y control group were no current o r previou s mental health disorders. Furthermore, potential subjects were excluded fo r several medical conditions, such a s uncontrolled cardiovascular, endocrinological, hematological, hepatic, renal, o r neurological disease, autoimmune conditions, chronic infection (i.e., HIV, hepatitis B or C), history of liver abnormalities, 35or evidence of infection within one month of screening, and their respective treatments, as steroids, antiretroviral therapy, anti -inflammatory, chemotherapy. These conditions and treatments might have confounded study interpretation and were confirmed by medical history (Supplementary Material). Participants were matched by sex, age, and years of education.", "Clinical assessments PD diagnosis was determined by a structured clinical interview based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders , Fourth Edition -Text Revision (DSM -IV-TR)1 administered by a trained psychiatrist or psychologist and independently confirmed by a research psychiatrist. The Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM -A)10, Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM -D)11, and Panic and Agoraphobia Scale (PAS)12 were administered to all patients to obtain measures of general psychopathology, and the Clinical Global Impression (CGI) scale13 was applied to evaluate total symptom severity. All assessments were made by psychiatrists trained in the administration and scoring of the assessments. The height and weight of all participants were recorded for body mass in dex (BMI) calculation. The procedures were explained, and written informed consent was obtained from participants prior to participation in the study, which was approved by the research ethics committee of the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro. This stu dy was performed in accordance with the ethical standards of the Declaration of Helsinki.", "Interleukins analysis Blood was obtained in the morning (8 a.m. ± 1 h) in EDTA tubes through a catheter after participants had at least 30 min of rest. Blood was imm ediately centrifuged (1000 xg for 10 min), and serum was removed and stored at −80 °C until the batch assay. Concentrations of the cytokines IL -10 and IL-1B and their soluble receptor, IL -2R, were assessed using the Immulite System (Diagnostic Products Corporation). For further details related to interleukins analysis, please refer to Supplementary Materials. Statistical analysis Statistical analyses were performed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS ) version 26.0. Normality of the distribution of the variables was tested using the Kolmogorov –Smirnov test. The cytokine IL -2R data were normally distributed, but the IL -10 and IL -1B data were not normally distributed. Independent samples t -tests were use d for parametric variables, and Mann -Whitney U tests were used for nonparametric variables. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. Multivariate linear regression models using stepwise methods were performed to evaluate the effect of independent fact ors on interleukin levels. Multiple linear regression using stepwise methods between the interleukins and several factors related to sociodemographic and physical characteristics (sex, age, educational years, first-degree family member with mental disorder , alcohol consumption, physical activity, BMI, and PAS, HAM -A, HAM -D and CGI scores) as independent variables were performed to assess the relationships of these potentially confounding variables to cytokine levels. Assumptions for linear regression assess ed: linearity was checked by a scatter plot, and it depicted no significant outlier. Visual inspection of residual plots did not reveal violations of the normality assumption. Furthermore, multicollinearity was checked, and the Pearson correlation coeffic ient and variance inflation factor (VIF) found to be < 1. All assumptions were met. The presence of multicollinearity among the independent variables was ruled out by the tolerance level and inflated variance 37 factor (IVF), which was greater than 0.1 and le ss than 10 for all, respectively. Homoscedasticity was confirmed using a scatter plot of predictors and standardized residuals. The normality of the residuals for each dependent variable was tested using a histogram and Q -Q plot of the standardized residua ls. We used the Bonferroni correction to control for multiple comparisons (a total of 16 variables were introduced; thus, the p -value threshold was set at .05/11 = .004).", "RESULTS The sample was composed of 76 drug -naïve individuals: 38 with PD and 38 healthy controls. The sample was 81.5% female and was successfully matched. There were no significant differences between groups regarding demographic characteristics, as described in Table 1.", "The multiple regression model did not show any associations be tween demographic scores and interleukin levels in the PD patients or in the controls. Therefore, interleukin levels were not affected by these potentially confounding variables. Analysis of serum chemokine levels revealed significantly higher levels of I L-1B (U = 258.5; p <0.001) and IL -2R (t = 5.14; df= 74; p<0.001) in the PD patients than in the healthy controls. Furthermore, IL -10 levels were lower (U = 361; p<0.001) in the PD patients than in the healthy controls (Supplementary Materials).", "DISCUSSION To our knowledge, this is the first study in which interleukin levels were measured in drug-naïve PD patients and matched controls. Our patient group consisted exclusively of drug -naïve first -episode PD patients who were in the acute phase of their illnes s. Our results revealed higher levels of the proinflammatory chemokines IL -1B and IL -2R and lower levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL -10 in drug -naïve PD patients than in healthy control subjects.", "Our findings suggested increased proinflammatory activity in the early phase of PD through increased IL -2R and IL -1B activity and a decrease in IL -10 levels. The differences between proinflammatory interleukins and anti -inflammatory interleukins might be related to microglia14. Microglia, the brain's endogenous immune cells, can switch from a surveillance mode to va rious levels of activation or reactivity in response to environmental stimuli (e.g., stranger and danger signals)15. M1, the classic activated state of microglia, releases proinflammatory mediators s uch IL - 6, IL-8, IL-1, IL-2R, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) and has been implicated in neurotoxicity16. The anti-inflammatory features of the M2 phenotype, on the other hand, stimulate tissue remodeling and repair by releasing high quantities of IL -4 and IL -1017. Evidence points toward chronic activation of microglia in several mental health disorders , such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, depression, and autism18,19. Chronic activation of microglia leads to increased production of cytokines and an imbalance between the pro‐inflammatory and anti ‐inflammatory states20. Considering our findings , it is reasonable to hypothesize that in PD patients, microglia might be chronically activated and producing inflammator y interleukins.", "Given the pivotal role of neurotransmission in anxiety disorders, it is important to understand how inflammation and inflammatory cytokines affect the monoaminesserotonin, noradrenaline, and dopamine, the excitatory amino acid glutamate, and the 38 inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). There are several mechanisms (Figure 1) through which inflammatory cytokines can cause reduced synaptic availability of monoamines, which is believed to be a key factor in the pathophysiology of PD21. In animal models, for example, IL-1B induction of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) increased the expression and function of serotonin reuptake pumps, resulting in decreased synaptic availability of serotonin and anxiety-like behavior22. Inflammatory cytokines, by generating reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, have also been reported to reduce the availability of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), a critical enzyme cofactor in the production of all monoamines that is especially sensitive to oxidative stress23. Indeed, in patients treated with the inflammatory cytokine IFN-alpha, BH4 levels in the cerebrospinal fluid were found to be negatively correlated with inflammatory interleukin levels in the cerebrospinal fluid24.", "Inflammatory interleukins have also been associated with alterations in tryptophan metabolism, the primary amino acid precursor of serotonin. The indoleamine-2,3- dioxygenase (IDO) enzyme, which catalyzes the rate-limiting step in the synthesis of kynurenine from tryptophan, can be induced by proinflammatory cytokines24. In central and peripheral immune-competent cell types, inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1B and IL-2R, have been shown to increase IDO expression6. Tryptophan can be degraded into kynurenine by activation of these cell types, which can lead to PD symptoms by reducing the availability of the necessary precursor for serotonin synthesis, causing disruption of serotonergic neurotransmission26. Furthermore, activated microglia in the brain can convert kynurenine to the neurotoxic metabolite quinolinic acid26. Quinolinic acid stimulates glutamate release, blocks glutamate absorption by astrocytes, and directly activates glutamate receptors (N-methyl-d- aspartate (NMDA) receptors)27. The direct effects of proinflammatory cytokines on glutamate metabolism, which include decreasing the expression of astrocyte glutamate reuptake pumps and stimulating astrocytic glutamate release, converge with the effects of quinolinic acid on glutamate metabolism, ultimately contributing to excessive glutamate both within and outside the synapse27. Increased excitotoxicity and decreased synthesis of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) result from glutamate binding to extrasynaptic NMDA receptors28. BDNF promotes neurogenesis, an important prerequisite for an antidepressant response29. However, in stress- induced animal models of anxiety, this molecule has been shown to be reduced by IL- 1B and IL-2R and their downstream signaling pathways, including NF- κB30. An increase in inflammatory cytokine levels could also be linked to PD through GABA deficit dysfunction4. GABAA receptors inhibit inflammatory cytokine expression and play an important anti-inflammatory role31. Evidence has shown that this receptor is dysfunctional in PD patients, which could contribute to PD pathophysiology32. Endogenous GABA tonically inhibits inflammatory interleukins, such as IL-6 and IL-1B, through GABA receptors31. Therefore, dysfunction of the GABAergic system has the great potential to not properly inhibit inflammatory responses, contributing to PD symptoms.", "Our results are in accord with previous studies that suggested that changes in inflammatory mediators may be associated with the pathophysiology of PD4. However, several questions remain to be answered. The physiological role of chemokines in the central nervous system (CNS), as well as the specific mechanisms of regulation and 41 balance of different inflammatory mediators in health and disease, are currently being investigated33. Therefore, much of the role of interleukins in the CNS is currently unknown. This study has strengths and limitations that should be considered when interpreting the results. The diagnostic interviews of both patients and controls were performed using the same protocol. In addition, blood samples were obtained between 8 and 9 a.m., minimizing circadian differences in cytokine levels potentially related to cortisol release. On the other hand, limitations inherent to cross -sectional studies (and thus also present here) preclude conclusions about causality.", "In summary, our study is significant in that it is the first to provide evidence for an increase in the inflammatory mediators IL -1B and IL -2R and a decrease in anti - inflam matory molecules, such as IL -10, in nonmedicated PD patients. If the current findings are confirmed in future studies, it could pave the way for a new era in PD treatment options and neuroscience research in general. Such complexities should be taken into account when developing drugs that act on chemokines and could be used to treat PD.", "42REFERENCES", "1. Kessler, R. C. et al.

Proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin 1B (IL -1B) and IL -2R can decrease the availability of monoamines such as serotonin (5 -HT), dopamine (DA), and noradrenaline (NE) by enhancing the expression and function of presynaptic reuptake pumps for 5 -HT, DA, and NE by activating mitogen -activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways and by reducing enzyma tic cofactors such as tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4). This cofactor is sensitive to cytokine -induced oxidative stress and is involved in the production of nitric oxide (NO) through NO synthase (NOS). The inflammatory interleukins IL -1B and IL -2R can also reduce relevant monoamine precursors by activating the enzyme indoleamine 2,3 -dioxygenase (IDO), which converts tryptophan, the primary precursor for serotonin, into kynurenine. Activated microglia can convert kynurenine to quinolinic acid (QUIN), which binds to the glutamate (Glu) N -methyl -d aspartate receptor (NMDAR). This, the combination of cytokine -induced reductions in astrocytic Glu reuptake and stimulation of astrocyte Glu release can lead to excessive Glu, an excitatory amino acid neurotransmitter. Exces sive Glu, especially when binding to extrasynaptic NMDARs, can then lead to reduced brain -derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels and excitotoxicity. Inflammation -related effects on BDNF can also affect neurogenesis and long -term potentiation. Furthermor e, GABA dysfunction 47might not properly inhibit inflammatory responses.

Subjects were excluded for a number of medical conditions that might confound study interpretation as confirmed by medical history. Individuals were excluded for uncontrolled cardiovascular, endocrinological, hematological, hepatic, renal, or neurologic al disease, autoimmune 50conditions, chronic infection (i.e., HIV, hepatitis B or C), history of liver abnormalities, or evidence of infection within one month of screening. Participants were evaluated using SCID -IV2 and excluded for a history of schizophren ia; active psychotic or depressive symptoms of any type; substance abuse and/or dependence within the past 6 months; an active eating disorder or obsessive compulsive disorder; and/or a score of less than 28 on the Mini -Mental State Examination3. Blood was collected at the Institute of Psychiatry at one screening visit for an analysis of interleukin levels. Laboratory assays: measurement cytokine levels Concentrations of cytokines and their soluble receptors were assessed using Immulite System (Diagnostic P roducts Corporation)4. This technology is based on a solid phase two-site chemiluminescent enzyme immunometric assay. The solid phase, a polystyrene bead, is coated with either a monoclonal specific antibody or an anti - ligand. Patient serum and alkaline ph osphatase -conjugated monoclonal antibody or, depending on the technique, a ligand -labeled antibody is incubated for 30 to 60 min at 37 °C. Unbound conjugate is then removed by a centrifugal wash (x3), after which a chemiluminescent substrate (a phosphate e ster of adamantyl dioxetane) is added, and the test unit is incubated for a further 10 minutes. The chemiluminescent substrate undergoes hydrolysis in the presence of alkaline phosphatase to yield an unstable intermediate with an emission of light. The bou nd complex, and thus also the photon output, as measured by the luminometer, is proportional to the concentration of cytokine in the sample. For each cytokine calibration, a master curve is constructed by the manufacturer using a material calibrated agains t the National Institute for Biological Standards and Control standards 3 . The analytical sensitivities of the IL-1B, IL -2R, and IL -10 assays were 1.5 pg/ml, 10 U/ml, and 1.0 g/ml, respectively, and the calibration range was up to 1000 ng/L for the three assays. Immulite cytokine controls 51were included in each analytical run. The intra -assay and interassay precision performances of the assays were determined on 10 replicates in a single run and in 20 different runs, respectively, and yielded intra - and interassay coefficients of variation for each cytokine of 5.8% and 1.1 –6.9% for IL -10, 9% and 4 –8.6% for IL -1B, and 6.5% and 2.3 –7.9% for IL -2R, respectively.", "Supplementary Results Table 1.

The analysis demonstrates that childhood trauma contributes to a proinflammatory state in adulthood, with specific inflammatory profiles counting on the specific type of traumatic event. Conclusion: This study is unique in providing inflammatory biomarkers evidence of distinct biological modifi cations in PD in the presence or absence of exposure to childhood abuse. These results contribute to a better understanding of the extent of influence of differences in trauma exposure on pathophysiological processes in PD and may have implications for personalized medicine.", "1. Introduction", "Childhood maltreatment is a complex problem that affects society greatly and is of immense importance to public health. Maltreatment during childhood afects fundamental biological processes and produces long-lasting epigenetic marks, leading to adverse mental health out - comes in adulthood (Szyf et al., 2011). Exposure to adverse life events in childhood has been linked to an increased susceptibility for a spread of psychiatric disorders, possibly via long-term influences on the immune system (Danese et al., 2007).", "Childhood trauma is associated with systemic inflammation as assessed by measurements of C-reactive protein (CRP) and inflammatory cytokines including tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin (IL)-6 (Danese et al., 2007). Childhood maltreatment was found to be associ ated with increased plasma CRP levels and inflammatory markers in subjects identified as being on the psychosis spectrum, depression and bipolar disorder (Aas et al., 2017) Panic Disorder (PD) is a common and disabling anxiety disorder that is associate with a pro-inflammatory cytokines profile (Quagliato and Nardi, 2018a). Furthermore, this disorder has a high incidence of trau matic events during childhood (Safren et al., 2002). Individuals who experience early life stress have been shown to develop PD more frequently in adulthood than subjects with no history of early life stress (Safren et al., 2002; Goodwin et al., 2005). However, to the present date none study evaluated the impact of childhood trauma on inflammatory markers in PD patientes. Furthermore, it is unknow if any immune ab normalities could be specific to at least one or more sorts of early life trauma. Several putative biological mechanisms by which childhood maltreatment may increase the risk for PD might be hypothesized. These include, but are not limited to, alterations in the hypothalamic-pituitary- adrenal (HPA) axis, and genetic and epigenetic processes as well as structural and functional brain imaging changes (Nemeroff, 2016).", "These biological mechanisms may provide insight into modifiable * Corresponding author.", "E-mail address: laiana.quagliato@gmail.com (L.A.

However, physical abuse did not predict IL-2R levels in controls.

As such, this provides strong evidence that childhood traumatic events significantly impact on the inflammatory system, thus offering a possible molecular pathway by which early life stress might contribute to vulnerability to developing psychiatric disorders later in life.", "The biological mechanisms that are associated with these long-term changes in immune function need to be further investigated. Modifica - tions in epigenetic regulation of gene expression could be responsible for this increased immune activation. Early life stress induces modifications of HPA and neuroplasticity-related methylation patterns (Mehta et al., 2013; McGowan et al., 2009). Maltreatment during infancy contributes to methylation of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), which correlates with reduced GR function (Tyrka et al., 2012), and demethylation of FKBP5 (Klengel et al., 2013; Perroud et al., 2011). FKBP5 is a heat-shock protein that inhibits the GR, an important regulator of inflammatory activity. Therefore, lower function of the GR due to epigenetic sup pression may allow for this exacerbated inflammatory activity (Pace et al, 2007). Increased inflammation itself can maintain and exacerbate the impaired GR function (Pace et al, 2007; Zunszain et al., 2011), leading to sustained GR resistance into adulthood (Fig. 2).", "There are several mechanisms in which pro-inflammatory cytokines could contribute to impaired GR function. For instance, inflammatory interleukins inhibit GR translocation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus through STAT5 phosphorylation (Raddatz et al., 2001). A MAPK pathway is also important for the inhibitory action of cytokines, since these proteins can inhibit GR-mediated gene transcription via p38 MAPK activation (Wang, 2004), leading to GR phosphorylation and a decrease in GR nuclear ligand-binding affinity (Irusen et al., 2002). Impaired GR function could be related to research findings of a cortisol hypo responsiveness in PD patients. Different panic-related stimuli, such as lactate and CO2, were used in the activation of the HPA-axis which, in fact, triggered feelings of panic but failed to result in cortisol secretion (van Duinen et al., 2005; Peskind et al., 1998). Its plausible to supposed that this could be related to an increase in inflammatory cytokines in PD patients, and an impairment in GR function. Microglia are the main immune cells in the CNS and are a primary target for glucocorticoids due to their high level of glucocorticoid re ceptor expression (Howes and McCutcheon, 2017). Acute and chronic stress has been shown to activate microglia through glucocorticoids. Recent evidence demonstrated that a range of stressors such as chronic restraint, social isolation and repeated social defeat led to significant increased levels of microglia in the frontal cortex, and that stress in early development leads to microglia increases that persist into adulthood (Calcia et al., 2016).", "Activated microglia are capable of proliferation, migration, and an - tigen presentation and release inumerous substances which will be either neuroprotective or neurotoxic (Kettenmann et al., 2011). Micro - glial activation is associated with a variety of psychiatric disorders, since microglial surveillance plays a crucial role in monitoring synaptic function and determining brain connectivity (Shafer et al., 2012; Tremblay et al., 2010). In addition, during postnatal development, synapses that are to be pruned become tagged with complement mole - cules and are thus removed by microglia (Stevens et al., 2007). Disruption of this system may lead to altered CNS connectivity, gener ating excess excitatory synapses that may be involved in the pathogen - esis of various mental health disorders (Zhan et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2016). Furthermore, microglial cells release different molecules that are potentially implicated in an excitatory-inhibitory imbalance (Quagliato and Nardi, 2018b), which may also contribute to the pathogenesis of psychiatric and neurological disorders (Quagliato et al., 2018).", "Microglia is associated with long-lasting effects of child trauma (Nelson, 2017). During neurodevelopment microglia assists the migra tion of neurons and the proper formation of neuronal networks and synapses (Schafer et al., 2012). Throughout life, it’s involved in neuro genesis, connectivity of neural networks, and synaptic plasticity (Scha - fer et al., 2012). Therefore, microglia are associated with many physiological processes, being a key regulator of CNS homeostasis and an important point in the pathogenesis of psychiatric disorders (Schafer Individual types of trauma exposure impact differentially on the inflammatory markers in PD patients. This finding raises the question on why differing types of childhood trauma are related to different aspects of inflammatory dysregulation. Although this question has got to be better elucidated, several variables related to individual trauma types, including age of exposure, duration of trauma or relationship to the perpetrator, may offer some insight into how individual types of trauma exposure might impact differentially on the inflammatory markers in PD patients. Previous investigations showed that different types of trauma impact differentially on mental health (Cougle et al., 2010; Mansueto et al., 2019; Varese et al., 2012). For instance, specific subtypes of anxiety disorders appear to develop counting on whether one is exposed to physical or sexual childhood abuse (Cougle et al., 2010), and child - hood sexual abuse is related with the development of auditory halluci - nations in psychosis (Varese et al., 2012).", "There are several potential confounding factors common to case control studies of PD that are relevant to the present study. Since some specific foods and diet types, such as meat, gluten, and high-fat diets, are related to an increase in IL-2 levels, the inflammatory effects of specific diets can not be excluded (Goel et al., 2020; Sugiyama et al., 2020). Thus, future studies should focus on the possible association between PD patients’ diet and interleukins. Because all patients in the current study were on antidepressants, the anti-inflammatory effects of these drugs cannot be ruled out. Therefore, PD patients may display a higher in flammatory profile if not on antidepressants (Wiedlocha et al., 2018). Furthermore, exposure to maltreatment could have time-varying effects, depending on when it first occurs. Studies have shown that negative experiences in early childhood can impact the development of brain circuitry and increase vulnerability to mental health problems (McLaughlin et al., 2011). Early life trauma can prevent children from Table 2 Descriptive statistics of interleukins.", "Interleukin Patients mean (sd) Controls mean (sd) p-value Journal of Affective Disorders xxx (xxxx) xxx 4learning to effectively regulate their emotions, and establishing suc - cessful peer relationships, which can increase the risk of developing psychopathology (Cicchetti, 1995). However, experiences of maltreat - ment later in development could also have deleterious effects. During adolescence, for instance, stress response systems go through dramatic changes potentially amplifying the negative effects of maltreatment (Garbarino and Stott, 1989). Our study didn’t consider the time-varying effects of child trauma in PD patients. Therefore, future studies should study the timing of maltreatment as a possible factor involved in the development of panic disorder.", "To the best of our knowledge, this case-control study assessing the influence of exposure to childhood maltreatment on inflammatory markers in peripheral blood in PD patients is unique. Our data provide evidence that the presence of physical abuse during childhood predicts an increase in IL-2R levels during adulthood in PD patients. This finding could not only have implications for biomarker research for PD but may help to elucidate pathophysiological differences in dependence of trauma exposure in immune disturbances accompanying this disorder. If these alterations are not limited to peripheral blood cells but extend to other organ systems, they might also aid in the search for disease mechanisms, more effective prevention strategies and treatments, affecting long-term PD outcomes.", "Funding None.", "CRediT authorship contribution statement Laiana A.

MECANISMOS CELULARES ASSOCIADOS AO TRAUMA INFANTIL", "Até o momento, pouco se sabe sobre mecanismos neurobiológicos que p odem justificar a associação de traumas na infância aos mais variados transtornos mentais. Evidências recentes mostram que possivelmente essa associação se dá por meio da ativação das células microgliais (DYE, 2018) .", "Uma característica da microglia é que uma vez que essa célula já tenha sofrido um est ímulo inicial, uma segunda exposição a um insulto ambiental contribui de maneira mais rápida para a transição da microglia para uma morfologia ativada e provoca respostas inflamatórias exageradas (SOMERA -MOLINA et al., 2007) . Esse fenômeno está associado a um aumento da concentração do com plexo inflamassoma da família NLR, contendo domínio pirina 3 (NLRP3) (GRACE et al., 2016) . Esse complexo está presente em célu las da microglia e a atividade do mesmo determina em grande parte a morfologia dessas células, a magnitude das respostas neuroinflamatórias das mesmas e o tempo decorrido entre a exposição a um estressor e o início de uma resposta inflamatória (ROVIRA -LLOPIS et al., 2018) . Como ilustração do papel do complexo NLRP3 na orquestração de estados neuroinflamatórios, pode ser citado um estudo em que um camundongo transgênico nocaute para o NLRP3 apresentava morfologias de células microglia is distorcidas sempre em direção a um estado vigilante, em vez de demonstrar o estado ativado e exibia respostas inflamatórias suprimidas (CHEN et al., 2018) . As propriedades cinéticas do complexo NLRP3 sugerem que se trata de uma proteína limitadora da taxa de produção de respostas inflamatórias pela microglia (CHEN et al., 2018) . Sua regulação também pode representar um mecanismo pelo qual os insultos ambientais alteram permanentemente as respostas neuroimunes (KAUFMANN et al., 2017) . O NLRP3 inicia a clivagem da pró -caspase -1 que subsequentemente cliva a pró -IL-1β em IL -1β (PAN et al., 2014) . A secreção de IL -1β pró -inflamatória pelo inflamassoma da microglia ativada está associada ao aumento de comportamentos ansiosos em roedores (PAN et al., 2014) . Além disso, o inflamassoma NLRP3 também está envolvido n a resposta ao dano do ácido desoxirribonucleico ( DNA ) (ROVIRA -LLOPIS et al., 2018) . Evidências mostram que o inflamassoma NLRP3 contribui para o aumento do estresse oxidativo na célula, suprime o reparo de DNA e aumenta a apoptose mediada p ela proteína do gene supressor p53 (KAUFMANN et al., 2017; ROVIRA -LLOPIS et al., 2018) .", "61O trauma infantil ativa o inflamassoma NLRP3, contribuindo para uma mudança na conformação da microglia e uma hiperativação dessa s células (KAUFMAN N et al., 2017) . A figura 2 ilustra a relação entre o trauma infantil e o complexo NLRP3. o que aumenta os níveis de cortisol. A elevação dos níveis de cortisol se relaciona a uma elevação dos níveis de marcadores de estresse oxidativo e interleucinas infla matórias, presumivelmente por meio da ativação da microglia. Traumas infantis ativam o inflamassoma NLRP3 na microglia. O inflamassoma NLRP3 causa a clivagem de pró -IL1B em IL -1B e leva à ativação microglial. A microglia ativada libera citocinas inflamatór ias e marcadores de espécies reativas de oxigênio. Os marcadores de espécies reativas de oxigênio podem prejudicar todos os componentes celulares, incluindo lipídios e DNA, e contribuir para a formação de produtos TBARS e 8 -OHdG. Ademais, a ativação do NLR P3 está associada a supressão de atividades de reparo do DNA e a ativação das vias de morte mediadas pela proteína do gene supressor p53.", "Hipotetizamos que em pacientes com TP virgens de tratamento, o trauma infantil induza a ativação do inflamassoma micro glial NLRP3, sugerindo uma possível ativação da microglia e , consequentemente , uma maior produção de citocinas pró - inflamatórias e de radicais oxidativos por essas células, juntamente a níveis aumentados de DNA danificado s e apoptose neuronal.

Furthermore, no studies to date have evaluated cytokine, oxidative stress, and DNA damage levels in drug -naïve panic disorder (PD) patients and their possible association with childhood trauma. Methods: The aim of the present study was to determine the levels of the proinflammatory interleukin (IL) -1B, the oxidative stress marker TBARS, and 8 - hydroxy -2’-desoxiganosina (8 -OHdG; representing DNA damage) in drug -naïve PD patients compared to controls. Furthermor e, this investigation aimed to determine whether early -life trauma could predict peripheral levels of the previously mentioned markers in unmedicated PD patients. Results: This work showed that drug -naïve PD patients presented elevated levels of TBARS and IL-1B but not 8 -OHdG compared to healthy controls. In addition, sexual abuse during childhood was associated with increased levels of IL -1B in PD patients. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that the microglial NLRP3 inflammasome complex might be activated i n drug -naïve PD patients. This study is the first to associated sexual abuse with increased levels of IL - 1B in drug -naïve PD patients and to demonstrate that this population presents high concentrations of oxidative stress and inflammation markers but not DNA damage markers when compared to healthy controls. Independent replication of these findings would support further clinical trials of inflammasome inhibitory drugs in PD patients, which could lead to effective novel treatments for people with PD and con tribute to elucidating pathophysiological differences depending on trauma exposure in the immune disturbances accompanying PD.", "65INTRODUCTION", "Early -life stress is a risk factor for the development of several mental disorders, including panic disorder (PD) (Aas et al., 2014; Lara -Cinisomo et al., 2018; Maniglio, 2013) . Recently, our group showed that PD patients with a lifetime history of physical abus e presented an increase in the inflammatory marker IL -2R(Quagliato et al., 2021) . This finding was corroborated by other studies demonstrating that people who experience trauma during childhood have increased levels of inflammatory cytokines in adulthood (Baumeister et al., 2016; Grosse et al., 2016) . Thus, the activation of the immune system might be associated with childhood trauma and the risk for PD development.", "The activation of the immune system is closely associated with the activation of microg lia(Wu et al., 2015) . Microglia are associated with the long -term impacts of childhood tra uma(Johnson and Kaffman, 2018) . Microglia aid in the migration of neurons and the establishment of neuronal networks and synapses during neurodevelopment (Schafer et al., 2012) . Microglia are important in neurogenesis, neuronal network connection, and synaptic plasticity throughout life (Schafer et al., 2012) . As a result, microglia are as sociated with a variety of physiological functions, including being a critical regulator of central nervous system (CNS) homeostasis and a pivotal point in the etiology of psychiatric diseases (Schafer et al., 2012) . Stress, both acute and chronic, has been proven to acti vate microglia via glucocorticoids (Frank et al., 2012) . Recent research found that a variety of stressors, including chronic restraint, social isolation, and repeated social defeat, resulted in significantly increased levels of microglia in the frontal cortex and that stress during early development leads to microglial activation that persists into adulthood (Walker et al., 2013) . As the only resident immune cells in the CNS, microglia are the first cells to respond to endogenous and exogenous insults to the brain (Lee and Chung, 2019) . By monitoring the parenchyma, microglia adopt a morphological state defined by a branched morphology and highly mobile processes that allow these cells to maximize efficiency and the total area monitored by each cell (Tay et al., 2019) . Upon the recognition of a toxin or stress signal in the CNS microenvironment that was being monitored by the microglia, these cells acquire an active pheno type defined by an amoeboid morphology (Tay et al., 2019) . In this morphology, microglia act by producing inflammatory cytokines a nd reactive oxygen species (ROS) (Wu et al., 2015) . For microglia to acquire an activated phenotype that produces inflammatory cytokines and free radicals, there is a need for the activation of a NOD-, LRR- and pyrin domain- containing protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome complex(Pan et al., 2014). This complex is found in microglia, and its activity influences the morphology of the cells as well as the amplitude of their neuroinflammatory responses(Pan et al., 2014). A transgenic NLRP3 knockout animal model had microglial morphologies skewed toward a vigilant state rather than an activated state and exhibited decreased neuroinflammatory responses, demonstrating the key function of NLRP3 in orchestrating neuroinflammatory states(Heneka et al., 2013). The kinetic properties of the NLRP3 protein indicate that it is a rate-limiting protein in the development of microglial neuroinflammatory reactions(Kaufmann et al., 2017). NLRP3 catalyzes the cleavage of pro-caspase-1, which then catalyzes the cleavage of pro-IL -1B to IL-1B (Kaufmann et al., 2017). In mice, proinflammatory IL-1B production by the activated inflammasomes of microglia is related to increased anxious behavior(Kaufmann et al., 2017) . The NLRP3 inflammasome is also implicated in the response to DNA damage(Alfonso-Loeches et al., 2012). This complex contributes to increased oxidative stress in the cell, decreases DNA repair, and enhances p53-mediated apoptosis(Rovira-Llopis et al., 2018).", "Early-life stressors activate the NLRP3 inflammasome, contributing to a change in microglial conformation and a hyperactivation of these cells, with the production of inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1B; oxidative stress markers, such as thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS); and, consequently, increased DNA damage, demonstrated by elevated levels of 8-hydroxy- 2’-desoxiganosina (8-OHdG)(Grace et al., 2016; Kaufmann et al., 2017; Rovira -Llopis et al., 2018). Some studies have shown that individuals with PD have increased mean blood levels of proinflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress markers(Aghayan et al., 2020; Naghipour Hamzekolaei et al., 2020; Quagliato et al., 2019; Quagliato and Nardi, 2018). Furthermore, childhood trauma is a risk factor for the development of PD(Quagliato et al., 2021). However, to date, no studies have investigated the interplay between childhood trauma and inflammatory markers, oxidative stress, and DNA damage in unmedicated PD patients. The primary aim of the present study was to investigate baseline levels of inflammatory and oxidative stress markers and DNA damage in a well-characterized, unmedicated , somatically healthy cohort of PD patients, controlling for relevant confounders. Based on previous research pertaining to this, our a priori hypotheses were that the specific oxidative stress marker TBARS; the concentration of 8-OHdG, representing DNA damage; and the inflammatory marker IL-1B would be elevated in unmedicated PD 68patients compared to controls. A secondary aim was to determine whether early -life trauma could predict peripheral levels of TBARS, IL -1B, and 8 -OHdG in unmedicated PD patients.", "METHODS Study design and participants This was a cross -sectional study with a matched sam ple of drug -naïve young adults. For this study, drug -naïve patients with PD (n = 38) were selected. Individuals were included in the PD group if they (1) had been diagnosed with PD and (2) self -reported no lifetime psychiatric medication use and no present or former psychotherapy. Drug - naïve status was defined as having never received psychotropic medicines or psychotherapy in one's life, as evidenced by universal electronic medical records and corroborated in the patient's interview. A healthy control grou p (n = 38) was also recruited. The healthy control group was required to have no present or previous mental health issues. Potential participants were also excluded if they had any uncontrolled cardiovascular, endocrinological, hematological, hepatic, rena l, or neurological diseases; autoimmune conditions; chronic infections (i.e., HIV, hepatitis B or C); a history of liver abnormalities; or evidence of infection of their respective treatments, such as steroids, antiretroviral therapy, anti -inflammatory the rapy, or chemotherapy, within one month of screening. These illnesses and therapies may lead to a bias in the interpretation of the study's results. Participants were matched based on their sex, age, and years of education.", "69Clinical assessments", "PD diagnosis was determined by a structured clinical interview based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision (DSM -IV-TR)(American Psychiatric Association, 2000) , administered by a trained psychiatrist or psychologist, and independently confirmed by a research psychiatrist. The Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM -A)(Maier et al., 1988) , Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM -D)(Hamilton, 1986) , and Panic and Agoraphobia Scale (PAS) (Bandelow, 1995) were administered to all patients to obtain measures of general psychopathology, and the Clinical Global Impression (CGI) scale (Furukawa et al., 2009) was applied to evaluate total symptom severity. Childhood trauma exposure was assessed using the short version of the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ) (Bernstein et al., 2003) . All assessments were made by psychiatrists trained in the administration and scoring of the assessments. The height and weight of all participants were recorded for body mass index (BMI) calculation. The procedures were explained , and written informed consent was obtained from participants prior to participation in the study, which was approved by the research ethics committee of the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro. This study was performed in accordance with the ethical stan dards of the Declaration of Helsinki.", "IL-1B, TBARS, and 8 -OHdG levels Blood samples were obtained in the morning (8 a.m. ± 1 h) in EDTA tubes through a catheter after participants had at least 30 min of rest. Blood samples were immediately centrifuged (1000 xg for 10 min), and serum was removed and stored at −80 °C until the batch assay. Concentrations of the cytokine IL -1B were assessed using the Immulite System (Diagnostic Products Corporation). This technology is based on a 70solid-phase two -site chemiluminescent enzyme immunometric assay. The solid phase, a polystyrene bead , is coated with either a monoclonal specific antibody or an anti - ligand. Patient serum was incubated with an alkaline -phosphatase -conjugated monoclonal antibody or, depending on the procedure, a ligand -labeled antibody for 30 to 60 minutes at 37 °C. Unbou nd conjugate was subsequently removed using a centrifugal wash (x3), and the test unit was incubated for 10 minutes with a chemiluminescent substrate (a phosphate ester of adamantyl dioxetane). The chemiluminescent substrate is hydrolyzed in the presence o f alkaline phosphatase, resulting in an unstable intermediate that emits light. The bound complex, and hence the photon output, as measured by the luminometer, is proportional to the cytokine concentration in the sample. For every cytokine calibration, a m aster curve was constructed by the manufacturer using a material calibrated against the National Institute for Biological Standards and Control standards.", "Levels of 8 -OHdG in serum aliquots were measured by an enzyme immunoassay protocol using a DNA Damag e Competitive Elisa Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) following the manufacturer’s instructions. In this protocol, the binding reaction is initiated by the addition of a peroxidase -labeled mouse monoclonal antibody to 8 - hydroxy -2'-deoxyguanosine to each well. After a 1 -hour incubation , the plate was washed , and substrate was added. The substrate reacts with the peroxidase -labeled antibody that has reacted with the bound conjugate. After a short incubation, the reaction was stopped , and the intensity of the generated color was detected in a microtiter plate reader capable of measuring at 450 nm .", "Lipid peroxidation levels we re measured using a TBARS Assay kit (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI, USA) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. In this method, MDA reacts with thiobarbituric acid (TBA) under high temperature (90 – 100 °C) and acidic conditions, generating the MD A-TBA adduct. The presence of the MDA -TBA adduct was determined fluorometrically at an excitation wavelength of 530 nm and an emission wavelength of 550 nm. All measurements were performed using a Synergy 2 multimode microplate reader and Gen5 Software (Bi oTek, Winooski, VT, USA). All assays were performed in duplicate. The intra - and interassay coefficients of variation were < 7.5% for all analytes.", "Statistical analysis Statistical analyses were performed using the Statistical Package for the Social Scien ces (SPSS) version 26.0. The normality of the distribution of the variables was tested using the Kolmogorov –Smirnov test. Independent-sample t tests were used for parametric variables, and Mann –Whitney U tests were used for nonparametric variables. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. Multivariate linear regression models using stepwise methods were performed to evaluate the effect of different subtypes of childhood trauma (physical abuse, emotional abuse, physical neglect, emotional neglect, sexual abuse) on IL-1B, TBARS, and 8-OHdG levels. Furthermore, multiple linear regression using stepwise methods between the interleukins and several factors related to sociodemographic and physical characteristics (sex; age; educational years; first-degree family member with a mental disorder; alcohol consumption; physical activity; BMI; and PAS, HAM-A, HAM-D and CGI scores) as independent variables was performed to assess the relationships of these potentially confounding variables to IL-1B, TBARS, and 8-OHdG levels. We used the Bonferroni 72correction to control for multiple comparisons (a total of 11 variables were introduced; thus, the p value threshold was set at .05/11 = .004).", "RESULTS Relationship of IL -1B, TBARS, and 8 -OHdG levels in PD patients and controls and their association with demographic factors The sample was composed of 38 drug -naïve individuals with a PD diagnosi s and 38 healthy controls. The sample was successfully matched, and there were no significant differences between groups regarding demographic characteristics, as shown in Table 1.There were no significant associations of IL -1B, TBARS, and 8 -OHdG levels w ith any confounding variables, such as age; sex; years of education; BMI; physical activity; ethnicity; onset age; or PAS, HAM -A, HAM -D or CGI scores.", "The analysis of serum IL -1B, TBARS, and 8 -OHdG levels revealed significantly higher patients than in healthy controls. However, the levels of 8 -OHdG were not statistically significantly different between patients and controls (p=0.9) (Table 1). Relationship between childhood tra uma subtypes and IL -1B, TBARS, and 8 - OHdG levels The multiple regression model showed that sexual abuse explained 31.3% of the variance in IL -1B levels (adjusted R2 = 0.313, F = 17.4; β = 0.57, p <0.001) in drug - naïve PD patients (Fig. 1). However, sexual abuse did not predict IL -1B levels in controls. TBARS and 8 -OHdG were not significantly correlated with any childhood trauma subtypes in either group when examined independently.", "73DISCUS SION", "This study provides the first evidence that drug -naïve PD patients present higher levels of TBARS and IL -1B than healthy controls, although the levels of 8 -OHdG were similar between participants. Furthermore, an association of early -life stress expos ure, represented by sexual abuse during childhood, with alterations in IL -1B levels was found in drug -naïve PD patients.", "One possible mechanism for the association between sexual abuse and IL -1B levels is via the chronic and repeated activation of the hyp othalamic –pituitary –adrenal (HPA) axis that occurs during the reexperiencing of early -life trauma. Studies on childhood trauma victims undertaken during childhood and adolescence have revealed higher cortisol levels (Alexander et al., 2018; Straub et al., 2017) . Glucocorticoids normally limit the manufacture and release of proinflammatory cytokines, but in conditions of excitotoxicity, increased levels of glucocorticoids may stimulate proi nflammatory cytokine expression (Alexander et al., 2018) . Furthermore, long -term exposure to elevated cortisol levels has been demonstrated in animal experiments to produce oxidative stress and inflammatory interleukins, possibly through the activation of microglia (Cheng et al., 2018) . The activation of microglia has been identified as a key cause of stress -related brain injury (Zhang et al., 2018) . The cytokines generated by activated microglia, in particular, limit neurogenesis and increase neuronal death, and these activities have been associated with the progression of neurological co nditions associated with childhood trauma and psychiatric disorders (Zhang et al., 2018) . inflammasome (Pan et al., 2014) . Early -life stress triggers the microglial NLRP3 inflammasome (Pan et al., 2014) . This structure induces the cleav age of pro -IL1B into IL-1B and contributes to the activation of microglia (Pan et al., 2014) . Microglia, in their activated phenotype, produce inflammatory interleukins, such as IL -6, TNF -alpha, and ROS markers. ROS can cause damage to all components of the cell, including proteins, lipids , and DNA (Zuo et al., 2019) . In pa rticular, ROS can react with the polyunsaturated fatty acids of lipid membranes and induce lipid peroxidation, resulting in TBARS products (Kodali et al., 2020) . Our study shows that drug -naïve PD patients presented increased levels of IL -1B and TBARS compared to healthy controls and that sexual abuse was a predictor of IL -1B levels in PD patients. Therefore, we can assume that patients with PD who had su ffered sexual abuse in childhood presented an activated NLRP3 inflammasome, which contributed to the cleavage of IL -1B into its activated form and to the activation of microglia, which acted to produce TBARS. The activation of microglia and the production of ROS by these cells can contribute to increased levels of DNA oxidation, as measured by 8-OHdG (Kodali et al., 2020) . DNA damage is one of the most detrimental consequences of increased oxidative stress in the CNS (Nissanka and Moraes, 2018) . When left unrepaired, DNA damage activates several pro -death signaling pathways, causing cell apoptosis and jeopardizing CNS function (Nissanka and Moraes, 2018) . Cells strive to counteract the accumulation of DNA damage in physiological settings by inducing endogenous DNA repair processes such as base excision repair, nucleotide excision repair, and nonhomologous endpoint joining (Nissanka and Moraes, 2018) . When NLRP3 and hence microglia become hyperactive, DN A repai r processes are repressed, while pathwa ys driving p53- mediated apoptosi s are enhanced(Nissanka and Moraes, 2018).", "Although we hypothesized that PD patients would have increased levels of 8-OHdG compared with healthy controls, this was not corroborated by our results. One possible explanation for this is that our study included only drug-naïve PD patients. Although there are sparse investigations regarding DNA damage in anxiety disorders, evidence shows that the severity and long-term duration of a mental illness are associated with 8-OH dG levels in some mental disorders, such as bipolar disorder(Goh et al., 2021; Vieira et al., 2021). Specifically, in bipolar disorder, the number of manic episodes was correlated with higher levels of 8-OHdG(Ceylan et al., 2018). Therefore, since we included only drug-naïve patients who were in the beginning stages of PD, it is possible that the short time of disease might have influenced our results regarding the 8-OHdG marker.", "A growing body of research suggests that neuroinflammation and oxidative stress play a role in the development of anxiety(Beheshti et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2021) . Lipopolysaccharide experiments, in particular, enhanced the expression of inflammasome proteins in the brain, notably on microglia, as well as the incidence of anxiety-like behavior in adolescent rats(Lei et al., 2017). Similarly, after chronic stress, the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and the upregulation of inflammatory mediators such as IL-1, IL-6, and IL-18 were observed in the hippocampus of rodents, and anxiety-like behavior was observed in these animals(Wang et al., 2018). As a result, earlier research has discovered that the NLRP3 inflammasome is activated in anxiety-induced animal models and that antidepressant medications block NLRP3 76inflammasome activation via autophagy (Alcocer -Gómez et al., 2017) . Furthermore, there is evidence of decreased antioxidant levels and increased nitric oxide and proinflammatory cytok ines (IL -1, IL -6, and TNF -) in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus of nervous mice (Zhang et al., 2016) . Increased le vels of proinflammatory cytokines cause significant changes in sleep patterns , locomotor activity, and hunger, symptoms that may be associated with anxiety disorders (Lasselin et al., 2020) . Furthermore, proinflammatory cytokines stimulate the HPA axis, resulting in a high level of cortisol in plasma and anxiety symptoms (Ziko et al., 2018) . In addition, apoptosis and DNA d amage in hippocampal neurons have been considered other important factors in the pathophysiology of anxiety (Khan et al., 2019) . This study has strengths and limitations that should be considered when interpreting the results. The diagnostic interviews of both patients and controls were conducted using the same protocol. In addition, blood samples were obtained between 8 and 9 a.m., minimizing circadian differences in cytokine levels potentially related to cortisol release. On the other hand, limitations inherent to cross -sectional studi es (and thus also present here) preclude conclusions about causality. To better evaluate the interplay between childhood trauma and PD and inflammation, oxidative stress, DNA damage, future studies should focus on postmortem investigations to assess the expression of NLRP3 in PD patients with a history of childhood trauma. Furthermore, longitudinal studies performed with children who have suffered an early -life trauma should investigate the levels of interleukins, oxidative stress markers, DNA damage and po ssible psychopathology at multiple time points, which would help understand which factors might put an individual at high risk for PD development and would assist in testing interventions capable of early diagnosis and even the prevention of PD. 77This study is the first to associated sexual abuse with increased levels of IL -1B in drug - naïve PD patients and to demonstrate that this population presents increased levels of TBARS and IL -1B but not 8 -OHdG compared to healthy controls. Independent replication of t hese findings would support further clinical trials of inflammasome inhibitory drugs in PD patients, which could lead to effective novel treatments for people with PD. Furthermore, our data provide evidence that the presence of sexual abuse during childhoo d predicts an increase in IL -1B levels during adulthood in drug - naïve PD patients. This finding may help to elucidate pathophysiological differences depending on trauma exposure in immune disturbances accompanying PD. If these alterations are not limited t o peripheral blood cells but are extended to other organ systems, they might also aid in the search for disease mechanisms and more effective prevention strategies and treatments, affecting long -term PD outcomes.", "78REFERENCES", "Aas, M., Haukvik, U.K., Djurovic, S., Tesli, M., Athanasiu, L., Bjella, T., Hansson, L., Cattaneo, A., Agartz, I., Andreassen, O.A., Melle, I., 2014.

Particularmente, patógenos infecciosos e inflamação durante a gestação têm sido associados à esquizofrenia e ao transtorno do espectro do auti sta (BOKSA, 2008; BUKA et al., 2008) . Ademais, diversos fatores inflamatórios matern os, incluindo obesidade, asma, doenças autoimunes e estresse psicossocial, estão associados a um risco aumentado de alterações no comportamento da prole (FETENE; BETTS; Simultaneamente aos estudos epidemiológicos estão os mo delos animais de ativação imune materna que documentam o comportamento anômalo , além de alterações neuroquímic as, anatômic as e fisiológic as na prole (GUMUSOGLU et al., 2017) .

Quagliato1,U r s u l ad eM a t o s1and Antonio E. Nardi1 Abstract Maternal immune activation (MIA) during pregnancy is recognized as an etiological risk factor for various psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia, major depressive disorder, and autism. Prenatal immune challenge may serve as a“disease primer ”for alteration of the trajectory of fetal brain development that, in combination with other genetic and environmental factors, may ultimately result in the emergence of different psychiatric conditions. However, the association between MIA and an offspring ’s chance of developing anxiety disorders is less clear. To evaluate the effect of MIA on offspring anxiety, a systematic review and meta-analysis of the preclinical literature was conducted. We performed a systematic search of the PubMed, Web of Science, PsycINFO, and Cochrane Library electronic databasesusing the PRISMA and World Health Organization (WHO) methodologies for systematic reviews. Studies thatinvestigated whether MIA during pregnancy could cause anxiety symptoms in rodent offspring were included. Overall,the meta-analysis showed that MIA induced anxiety behavior in offspring. The studies provide strong evidence thatprenatal immune activation impacts speci ﬁc molecular targets and synapse formation and function and induces an imbalance in neurotransmission that could be related to the generation of anxiety in offspring. Future research should further explore the role of MIA in anxiety endophenotypes. According to this meta-analysis, MIA plays an important role in the pathophysiological mechanisms of anxiety disorders and is a promising therapeutic target. Introduction Maternal immune activation (MIA) during pregnancy is recognized as an etiological risk factor for various psy- chiatric and neurological disorders in offspring1. The highly orchestrated processes of neural development startwith the proliferation and migration of glia and neurons followed by programmed cell death, the formation of synapses, myelination, and the establishment of neuronalcircuits", "2. Therefore, in ﬂammation in the mother during", "pregnancy can affect several vulnerable aspects of fetalbrain development", "3. This disturbance may contribute to a", "wide spectrum of neuronal dysfunction and behavioralphenotypes in the progeny Considering that MIA might lead to altered behavior in offspring, an alternative model has emerged as an expla-nation for the etiology of psychiatric disorders: the two-hitmodel 4–6. In this model, two “hits ”are required for the emergence of disorders in offspring: a ﬁrst “hit”, which occurs during prenatal life (such as MIA) and disrupts theoffspring ’s central nervous system (CNS) development, thereby increasing the vulnerability to a second “hit”, which might occur later in life and leads to the onset of the disorder", "7.

If multiple publications were identi ﬁed to have studied the same cohort, the most recent or most complete publication was used for dataextraction.Data extraction and quality assessment The following data were extracted from each included study independently by two authors in duplicate: title, name of the ﬁrst author, year of publication, MIA method, time window of MIA, sample size, percentage of animalsof each sex, group comparison, age at sample collection,and outcomes. Two independent reviewers (L.A.Q. and U.M.) assessed the quality of the studies using the SyrclesBias Tool 29(Table S1).", "Statistical analysis Random-effects pairwise meta-analyses using the Der- Simonian and Laird random-effects model were con-ducted. The main outcome measure was the presence orabsence of validated preclinical anxiety behavior in theoffspring of dams exposed to MIA versus those notexposed to MIA, the results were considered statisticallysigniﬁcant at the α=0.05 level. We used the standardized mean difference, which was obtained by calculating the mean (SD) and sample size ( n) of the MIA offspring group versus the non-MIA offspring group, as the summarystatistic.

Adult offspring were evaluated after experiments that may have induced MIA in their mothers were per-formed. The main outcome measure of this meta-analysis was how long the offspring of dams exposed to MIA and those of dams not exposed to MIA spent in the open armsin the elevated plus-maze test. The overall effect size of areduced time spent in the open arms in the elevated plus-maze test as a result of MIA was −3.28 [95% CI −3.99 to −2.57], and no substantial heterogeneity was observed (I 2=0%, p=0.70) (Fig. 2). Publication bias was not assessed, as there was an inadequate number of included studies to properly assess a funnel plot or to perform more advanced regression-based assessments.", "Discussion Our meta-analysis demonstrated that progeny exposed to inﬂammation in utero spent less time in the open arms in the elevated plus-maze test than animals that were notexposed to an in ﬂammatory stimulus during pregnancy. In this test, a shorter time spent in the open arms indi- cates greater anxiety. Therefore, our meta-analysisshowed that in ﬂammation during pregnancy generates anxiety symptoms in adult offspring.", "Mechanistically, prenatal exposure to in ﬂammation might contribute to abnormalities in the CNS, includingGABAergic delay, attenuated serotonin and noradrenalineneurotransmission, reduced growth of the lateral ven- tricles, decreased amygdala, and periaqueductal gray matter volumes, decreased density of dendritic spines ongranule cells in the hippocampus, and increased micro-glial reactivity 30,32,33. However, the speci ﬁc molecular mechanisms by which MIA contributes to anxiety inoffspring have yet to be elucidated. Alterations in neurotransmission are thought to be central to many psychiatric disor ders, including anxiety 35,36.T odate, much of our knowledge is related to the role of neu- rotransmitter systems in the adult brain in anxiety.

KCC2 activity maintains a low intracellular Cl−concentration, a prerequisite for effective GABA/Gly-mediated inhibition in the nervous system39. Since MIA promotes elevation of intracellular chloride concentrations in the offspring brain, GABAremains excitatory in developmental time windows whenit is normally inhibitory 39,40. This process renders neu- ronal networks hyperexcitable39,41.", "Genetic alterations in the KCC2 gene have been reported to confer increased anxiety susceptibility42. However, the ability of an environmental stimulus, such as MIA, to modify KCC2 expression and lead to an anxious phenotype is not well established in the literature. Of note, a defect in thedepolarizing-to-hyperpolarizing switch, which is responsiblefor excitatory/inhibitory imbalance, has been identi ﬁed as a key pathophysiological mechanism in several neurodeve-lopmental disorders, such as autism and schizophrenia which are typically associated with MIA43,44.T h ed e l a yi n the excitatory-to-inhibitory swi tch is intrinsically maintained in neurons isolated from the brain and maintained in pri- mary cultures independent of the brain environment due toepigenetic mechanisms that alter neuron developmentaltrajectories", "45.T h i si sc o n s i s t e n tw i t ht h ei n d u c t i o no f", "behavioral alterations by MIA in the ﬁrst- generation and second-generation offspring of immune-challenged ances-tors, demonstrating the transgenerational nongeneticinheritance of pathological traits Fig. 2 Forest plot.

Together, these studies suggest that optimal levels of serotonin, noradrenaline, and GABAmust be maintained during development and that anydeviations from these optimal levels in either directioncan lead to long-lasting behavioral de ﬁcits. Plasticity during the perinatal period is essential for the developing brain to adapt to a changing environment butprovides the opportunity for external factors to derail neuronal circuits and lead to maladaptive behaviors This perinatal time window is a critical period whenserotonergic, noradrenaline, glutamatergic and GABAer-gic activity can shape the development of neuronal cir-cuitry and speci ﬁcally emotional neurocircuits Our review has several limitations.

According to this meta-analysis, MIAplays an important role in the pathophysiologicalmechanisms of anxiety disorders. While there is a clearneed for more studies addressing these issues in primatesand cross-validation between species, MIA could be apromising therapeutic target for anxiety disorders. Future studies should focus on investigating the interactions between in ﬂammation and genetic factors as well as with other environmental factors, such as diet and drugexposure, which may be important mediators of the neural consequences of maternal infection. Studies aimedat translating ﬁndings from animal models to humans may facilitate the identi ﬁcation of new risk factors, mechanistic pathways, and interacting genetic mutationsrelated to MIA and anxiety disorders.

A NSIEDADE: DE PAI PARA FILHO", "O estadiamento clínico é uma estratégia utilizada e comprovadamente eficaz na medicina em geral, no qual não apenas a qualidade de vida, mas também a sobrevida podem depender da introdução o mais precoce possível de um trata mento eficaz (SCOTT; HENRY, 2017) . Na insuficiência cardíaca congestiva, por exemplo, o modelo de estadiamento auxilia no diagnóstico e na seleção do tratamento, ligando o fenótipo clínico com a extensão da progressão da doença (CANTER et al., 2007) . O estadiamento clínico coloca o estado atua l de um indivíduo em um continuum de progressão do transtorno que compreende do estágio 0 (um estágio de risco ou latência, geralmente identificado por marcadores genéticos ou biológicos) até o estágio IV (SCOTT; HENRY, 2017) .", "O desafio para o estadiamento clínico na psiquiatria concentra -se, majoritariamente, em definir fenótipos clínicos que indiquem um risco aumentado para a progressão para transtornos mentais graves, complexos, persistentes ou recorre ntes (MCGORRY et al., 2006) . Se o prognóstico de um distúrbio é dinâmico e variável, compreender o risco e os fatores de proteção que influenciam a progressão (transição de alto risco, apresentações subliminares para caso de diagnóstico), estase (progressão para, mas estabilização em um estágio específico) ou reversão, torna -se crítico (MCGORRY et al., 2006) .", "A percepção de que uma grande parte dos transtornos mentais tem curso crônico está levando os pesquisadores a focar como interesse de pesquisa no estabelecimento de fatores de risco capazes de predizer risco individu al (CASPI et al., 1996) . Esse objetivo tem a intenção de selecionar sujeitos com risco elevado com intuito de testar intervenções capazes de diagnosticar precocemente e até mesmo prevenir os transtor nos mentais (MCGORRY; KILLACKEY; YUNG, 2008) . Aqueles com história de transtorno mental em familiares de primeiro grau são conside rados indivíduos de alto risco para um determinado transtorno (CASPI et al. , 1996) . A ativação das células da glia, bem como o aumento de citocinas inflamatórias circulantes encontram -se presentes não só em pacientes com transtornos mentais, como também em seus familiares de prim eiro grau, sendo inclusive sugerida associações entre alterações comportamentais na prole e aumento de citocinas inflamatórias durante a gestação (ABAZYAN et al., 2010; O’LOUGHLIN et al., 2017) . Por exemplo, a elevação dos níveis de IL -6 durante a gestação pode predizer , futuramente, prejuízos na memória de trabalho dos filhos, mesmo em mulheres hígidas, o que poderia estar relacionado a ativação das células da glia (RUDOLPH et al., 2018). Há uma ativação do sistema imune muito antes do desenvolvimento de qualquer quadro psicopatológico (GERSHON et al., 2013; NETTIS; PARIANTE; MONDELLI, 2019). Dessa forma, pode-se supor que indivíduos no estágio 0, ou seja, indivíduos em um estágio de risco ou latência, apresentam uma ativação do seu sistema imune, o que pode contribuir para o desenvolvimento de psicopatologia no futuro .", "Evidências mostram que ter um pai acometido por um transtorno de ansiedade leva a um aumento de sete vezes a possibilidade de o filho também apresentar um diagnóstico de transtorno de ansiedade ao longo da vida (TURNER ; SAMUEL ; BEIDEL, 1991). Verificou-se que tanto a transmissão genética das vulnerabilidades à ansiedade quanto os fatores ambientais resultantes do crescimento com pais ansiosos contribuem para a sobreposição entre a ansiedade dos pais e de seus filhos (TURNER ; SAMUEL; BEIDEL, 1991). Dessa forma, avaliar os pródromos dos transtornos de ansiedade é útil para auxiliar no desenvolvimento de etapas de prevenção e elucidar os fatores de risco e proteção para esses transtornos. Até o momento, o delineamento dos fatores de risco ou marcadores dos estágios iniciais dos transtornos de ansiedade têm se concentrado principalmente nas medidas cognitivas e psicossociais (AKTAR ; MAJDANDZIC ; BOGELS, 2014; PARKER et al., 2019). Entretanto, em outros transtornos mentais, particularmente na esquizofrenia e no transtorno bipolar, estudos demonstram alterações em biomarcadores periféricos, como citocinas inflamatórias, em familiares de primeiro grau de indivíduos com diagnóstico de transtorno bipolar e esquizofrenia (CORSI- ZUELLI et al., 2020; TATAY-MANTEIGA et al., 2020). Corroborando esses dados, sabe-se que parentes de primeiro grau de pessoas com diagnóstico de esquizofrenia apresentam hiperativação das células microgliais (SHAKORY et al., 2018) e que familiares de primeiro grau de indivíduos com diagnóstico de transtornos mentais têm uma incidência aumentada de doenças autoimunes (GILVARRY et al., 1996 ). Vias genéticas relacionadas ao sistema imune foram recentemente associadas ao TP, uma condição com agregação familiar e herdabilidade modesta (FOLDAGER et al., 201 4). Entretanto, até o momento, não existem investigações acerca da possível ativação do sistema imune em familiares de primeiro grau de indivíduos com 95 96diagnóstico de TP. Des sa forma, o quinto trabalho des ta tese tem a finalidade de comparar os marcador es inflamatórios IL -1B e IL -2R entre pacientes com TP, os seus filhos e controles saudáveis. Já no sexto manuscrito, iremos investigar, por meio de uma revisão sistemática da literatura, como a ansiedade dos pais no período pré ou pós-natal pode contribuir para o desenvolvimento de pródromos na prole. 972.5.1.

An increase in circulating inflammatory cytokines is observed not only in people with mental disorders but also in their first -degree relatives. A considera ble amount of data support the link between immune system activation and panic disorder (PD) pathogenesis, while it is still unclear whether differential immunological reactivity represents a propensity, a measure of disease activity, or both. To better un derstand the role of cytokines in PD pathophysiology, we compared the levels of serum inflammatory biomarkers interleukin (IL) -1B and IL -2R among PD patients, offspring of PD patients and healthy controls. The offspring of PD patients were evaluated by a psychiatrist and were considered unaffected by any mental disorder at the time of the evaluation. Concentrations of the cytokines IL -1B and IL -2R were assessed using the Immulite System (Diagnostic Products Corporation). The levels of proinflammatory marker s IL-1B and IL -2R were increased in PD patients compared to those of controls, but offspring of PD patients and healthy controls demonstrated no differences regarding peripheral interleukin levels. Our findings suggest that interleukins might represent a d isease -dependent marker in PD.", "100 INTRODUCTION", "Longitudinal studies have revealed that among persons who are genetically susceptible to mental diseases, such diseases develop in a series of predictable clinical stages1,2. In other areas of medicine, a developmental approach to diagnosis is well established and useful, allowing for early accurate identification and the develop ment of stage -specific therapy to prevent illness progression3. Understanding the pathophysiological proce sses associated with the clinical stages of illness progression is crucial for improving the clinical staging model and discovering novel early treatment targets.", "Panic disorder (PD) is a common and incapacitating anxiety disorder4. A considerable amount of data support the link between immune and neuroendocrine system activatio n and PD pathogenesis5,6; however, it is still unclear whether differential immunological reactivity represents a predisposition, a measure of disease activity, or both. The presence of high circulating amounts of proinflammatory cytokines in individual s experiencing panic attacks indicates an aberrant condition6. Chronic PD, on the other hand, has also been linked to changes in cytokine output in at least a subgroup of individuals5. Inflammatory cytokines have been linked to P D pathogenesis at the molecular level7. Peripheral cytokines, in p articular, can alter amygdala activity and promote anxiety -like behavior8. The amygdala, the brain's fear processing center, has been linked to the genesis of PD and panic episodes8. Furthermore, genetic immune -related pathways have recently been linked to PD, an illness with familial aggregation and modest heritability9.", "Alterations in the immune system have been related to a varie ty of mental illnesses, including autism spectrum disorder, major depressive disorder, and bipolar disorder10,11. The increase in circulating inflammatory cytokin es is evident not only in people with mental illnesses but also in their first -degree relatives12; in addition, linkages between behavioral changes in offspring and inflammatory cytokines have been hypothesized13. For example, mothers who have depressed symptoms during pregnancy have greater levels of circulating interleukins (IL), which is related to offspring negativity13. Furthermore, an increase in IL -6 levels during pregnancy may signal difficulties with children's w orking memory, which may be linked to glial cell activation, even in healthy mothers14. In addition, first -degree relatives of people with psychosis and bipolar disorder had higher levels of inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress in their blood15,16.", "Our group demonstrated that patients with PD have alterations in thei r peripheral levels of inflammatory cytokines5. However, to date, it is not known whether the offspring of patients with this diagnosis may also exh ibit alterations in inflammatory markers. A comparison of these biomarkers in patients with PD and subjects genetically at -risk for PD might allow an in -depth examination of the molecular pathways underlying the pathophysiology of PD.", "The current study wa s designed to compare the levels of inflammatory biomarkers IL- 1B and IL -2R among PD patients, offspring of PD patients and healthy controls. We hypothesized that the levels of these markers may be increased in PD patients and their offspring in comparison to the levels in healthy controls.", "101 METHODS", "The current study was approved by the official Medical Ethical Committee Board of the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro and was conducted according to the principles expressed in the Declaration of Helsinki. All included participants provided written informed consent.", "Study participants For this study, PD subjects ( n = 39), their offspring (n=16), and healthy controls (n=38) were selected. The inclusion criteria for individuals in the PD group were as follows: individuals (1) were diagnosed with PD, (2) had an offspring older than 18 years old willing to participate in the study , and (3) had offspring who were evaluated by a psychiatrist and considered unaffected by any mental disorder at the time o f the evaluation. A healthy control group of individuals was also recruited (n = 38). The inclusion criterion for individuals in the healthy control group were no current or previous mental health disorders. Furthermore, potential applicants were excluded due to a range of medical issues that may have affected research interpretation and were validated by medical history. Individuals who had uncontrolled cardiovascular, endocrinological, hematological, hepatic, renal, or neurological disease; autoimmune conditions; chronic infection (i.e., HIV, hepatitis B or C); a history of liver abnormalities; or evidence of infection within one month of screening were not permitted to participate. Participants were also excluded if they had a history of schizophrenia, active psychotic or depressive symptoms, drug abuse and/or dependency in the last 6 months, an active eating disorder, obsessive -compulsive disorder, and/or a Mini - Mental State Examination score of less than 28.", "Clinical assessments PD diagnosis was determined by a structured clinical interview based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, F ourth Edition -Text Revision (DSM -IV-TR)17 administered by a trained psychiatrist or psychologist and indep endently confirmed by a research psychiatrist. The Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM -A)18, Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM -D)19, and Panic and Agoraphobia Scale (PAS)20 were administered to all patients to obtain data about their of general psychopathology. I n addition, the Clinical Global Impression (CGI)21 scale was applied to evaluate total symptom severity. A structured clinical interview based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders was also performed on the offspring of individuals with PD and healthy controls , and only those without any diagnosis were included in this research. All assessments were made by psychiatrists trained in the administration and scoring of the assessments. The height and weight of all participants were recorded for body mass index (BMI) calculation. Interleukin analysis Blood was obtained in the morning (8 a.m. ± 1 h) in EDTA tubes through a catheter after participants had at least 30 min of rest. Blood was immediately centrifuged (1000 xg for 10 min), and serum was removed and stored at −80 °C until the batch assay 102 was p erformed. Concentrations of the cytokines IL -1B and IL -2 receptor (IL -2R) were assessed using the Immulite System (Diagnostic Products Corporation). This technology is based on a solid phase two -site chemiluminescent enzyme immunometric assay. The solid ph ase, a polystyrene bead, was coated with either a monoclonal specific antibody or an anti -ligand. Patient serum was incubated with an alkaline phosphatase -conjugated monoclonal antibody or, depending on the procedure, a ligand -labeled antibody for 30 to 60 minutes at 37 °C. Unbound conjugate was subsequently removed using a centrifugal wash (x3), and the test unit was incubated for 10 minutes with a chemiluminescent substrate (a phosphate ester of adamantyl dioxetane). The chemiluminescent substrate was hyd rolyzed in the presence of alkaline phosphatase, resulting in an unstable intermediate that emits light. The bound complex, and hence the photon output, as measured by the luminometer, is proportional to the cytokine concentration in the sample. For every cytokine calibration, a master curve was constructed by the manufacturer using a material calibrated against the National Institute for Biological Standards and Control standards. The analytical sensitivities of the IL -1B and IL -2R assays were 1.5 pg/ml and 10 U/ml, respectively, and the calibration range was up to 1000 ng/L for the two assays. Immulite cytokine controls were included in each analytical run. The intra - assay performance and interassay precision performance of the assays were determined on 10 replicates in a single run and in 20 different runs, respectively. This yielded intra - and interassay coefficients of variation for each cytokine of 9% and 4 – 8.6% for IL -1B and 6.5% and 2.3 –7.9% for IL -2R, respectively.", "Statistical analysis Statistical a nalyses were performed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 26.0. The normality of the distribution of the variables was tested using the Kolmogorov –Smirnov test. Demographic differences between the groups were tested using t tests or χ2-tests for continuous and categorical variables, respectively. One-way ANOVA was performed to compare the effect of IL-1B and IL- 2R in PD patients, their unaffected offspring, and healthy controls. Tukey HSD tests were used to calculate differences between specific groups. A P value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.", "RESULTS The sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of the three groups are described in Table 1. There were no significant differences among groups in most sociodemographic variables, such as sex, BMI, and completed education. However, the groups significantly differed in terms of their age.", "There was a statistically significant difference between the IL -1B and IL -2R levels p<0.001, respectively ). Tukey's HSD test for multiple comparisons found that the mean value of IL -1B was significantly different between PD patients and healthy controls (p<0.001, 95% CI = [0.16; 0.6]) . In addition, IL -1B levels were significantly different between PD patients and their offspring (p = 0.003, 95% CI = [0.13; 0.74]). IL -1B was not significantly different between healthy controls and the offspring of patients diagnosed with PD (p = 0.95) . Regarding IL -2R, post hoc tests demonstrated that the mean level of IL -2R was significantly different between patients with PD and healthy 103 controls (p<0.001, 95% CI = [0.46,0.81]). Furthermore, the level of IL -2R was significantly different between PD patients and their offspri ng (p<0.001, 95% CI = [0, 48.0.93]). There was no statistically significant difference between healthy controls and descendants of PD patients (p = 0.71).", "DISCUSSION There is evidence that immunological markers play an essential role in the etiology of many illnesses, notably neurological and psychiatric disorders, due to the sensitivity of the central nervous system to inflammation22,23. Our study showed that the levels of IL-1B and IL -2R, proinflammatory markers, are increased in PD patients compared to those of controls. However, our main hypothesis that offspring of PD patients might present alterations in inflammatory markers was not confirmed, since adult offspring of PD patients and healt hy controls presented no differences regarding peripheral interleukin levels.", "There is a substantial body of evidence linking PD to poor immune functioning in at least a subset of people24,25. Acute panic attacks are related to inflammatory markers, and effective antidepressant medications have been shown to restore the balance of pro- and anti -inflammatory mediators6,26. People with PD are more prone to develop systemic inflammatory diseases, whereas patients suffering from inflammatory illnesses are more likely to develop anxiety disorders27,28. Furthermore, there have been recent reports of a shift in the balance of immune and neurotrophic mediators over the course of established PD, implying the development of mo re severe immune dysregulation and a reduction in neurotrophic factors in patients with recurrent episodes of illness, poor remission, and a high burden of illness29. We hypothesized that adult offspring of PD patients would have alterations in their interleukin levels because immune c ells, the inflammatory processes and immune and neurotrophic growth factors would influence the development and function of the limbic system30. Offspring of anxiety disorder parents exhibit alterations in their limbic brain regions31. The limbic system is part of the “fear network model (FNM)” traditionally associated with PD pathophysiology32. Frontal and limbic structures, such as the insula, thalamus, periaqueductal gray matter, locus coeruleus , parabrachial nucleus and nucleus of solitary tract, medial frontal gyrus, anterior cingulate, amygdala and hippocampus, brainstem, and hypothalamus were included in the FNM32. The frontal areas should adequately moderate the excessive fear reactions in the limbic region33. Panic attacks will occur if the fear reaction is not adequately controlled33. Panic symptoms' anxiety and arousal are connected to attention modulation toward the threat and emotional salience of the threat33. The amygdala is the focal point of the classical FNM and is associated with the medial f rontal cortex and the hippocampus; together, these areas govern fear response and fear memory34. Furthermore, amygdala projection s are associated with the brainstem and hypothalamus for panic symptoms related to autonomic nervous system malfunction35. According to new research, serum inflammatory cytokines are inversely related to the integrity of myelin sheaths in extensive overlapping networks of white matter fibers, largely located in the anterior portion of the brain, implying a reduc tion in structural connectivity in key corticolimbic networks36. Because offspring of anxiety patients have abnormalities in their limbic areas37, we hypothesiz ed that offspring of PD patients would have alterations in serum 104 inflammatory cytokines that are related to the development and function of their limbic areas. Our findings, however, did not support this.", "Our investigations showed that PD patients present ed elevated levels of IL -1B and IL - 2R compared to those of healthy controls. This finding is consistent with previous studies that suggested that changes in inflammatory mediators may be associated with the pathophysiology of PD6. There are several mechanisms by which inflammatory cytokines might affect PD pathophysiology. Specifically , the cytokines IL -1B and IL -2R can decrease the availability of monoamines, such as serotonin, dopamine, and noradrenaline, by enhancing the expression and function of presynaptic reuptake pumps for these monoamines38. Furthermore, inflammatory cytokines can reduce relevant monoamine precursors by activating the enzyme indoleamine 2,3 - dioxygenase, which converts tryptophan, the primary precursor for serotonin, into kynurenine38,39. Thus, there is a reduction in serotonin levels and an increase in kynurenine metabolites, which can lead to excitotoxicity39.", "This study had several limitations. The small number of high -risk offspring, as well as the cross -sectional research methodology, are key limitations of this work. However, all subjects in this study were prospectively examined in clinical interviews many times, and their parents were investigated longitudinally to assure diagnostic stability. A longitudina l strategy that tracks changes in putative biomarkers in high -risk people over the course of illness development would undoubtedly be a far more powerful approach to understanding the pathophysiology underpinning illness development and is needed to valida te and refine the clinical stages of PD. Another limitation of this study is that only adult offspring with no psychopathology were included in this investigation, which limited the findings to a specific subgroup. However, this was intended to reduce the heterogeneity in the offspring sample, considering that children and adolescents are in different states of neurodevelopment and immune system maturation. Future studies evaluating immune system alterations in children and adolescent offspring of PD patien ts are warranted . However, given the limitations discussed, this study provides evidence suggesting that there are identifiable differences in cytokine expression in PD patients, which is corroborated by previous literature6.", "The presence of cytokine alterations during PD and the absence of any alterations in the offspring of patients with PD suggest that interleukins might represent a disease - dependent marker. It is becoming clear that investing in research aimed at identifying sensitive biological markers associated with etiological processes, treatment responsiveness, and long -term results in psychiatry is a critical step forward40. Such research relies on starting with well -characterized high -risk samples to limit heterogeneity40. Sensitive pathways involved in the development of PD can thus be differentiated from the burden of symptoms associated with recurring panic attacks, therapy, and medical and psy chological implications. This study yielded a complete working model of how PD develops in genetically predisposed individuals, refined the clinical staging model and discovered additional stage -specific targets for intervention and disease prevention.", "105 REFERENCES", "1.

To reduce the societal AD burden, verified AD prodromes could be useful to determine early treatment and prevention steps and elucidate risk and protective factors. Being affected by any mental illness increases the risk of mental illness in the patient’s offspring. The offspring o f parents with AD are at high risk for different types of psychopathology, including AD. However, little is known about how parental anxiety during pregnancy and/or the postnatal period might result in alterations in behavior or neurodevelopmental changes in offspring. To examine the effect of parental AD on offspring behavior and neurodevelopment, we conducted a systematic review. Forty - seven articles met the inclusion criteria for the systematic review. Prenatal maternal anxiety is related to negative temperament, increased attention to fearful vocalizations, decreased alertness, and impaired psychomotor and cognitive development in early and middle childhood. AD during the postnatal period is associated with greater negative temperament, and internalizing symptoms in early childhood, middle childhood, and adolescence. Progeny research should be on the agenda of mental health and public policies to reduce the burden of AD on society.", "Keywords: intergenerational, anxiety, neurodevelopment, fear.", "112INTRODUCTION", "Mental disorders start early in life and are among the greatest contributors to disability and health costs. As such, the study of mental health has been a priority on the global agenda in recent years (Becker and Kleinman, 201 3). This emphasis is due to the high degree of functional limitation and suffering caused by mental disorders (Becker and Kleinman, 2013) . It is known that 22.7% of the years lived with disability in the world population today are due to mental disorders (Vos et al., 2012) . Of this burden, 3.5% is attributable to a nxiety disorders ( Vos et al., 2012) . For every euro invested in the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder , four euros are earned in terms of health and work capacity (Chisholm et al., 2016) . Thus, the early identification of mental disorders and efficacious treatment have become imperative. The focus should expand to the well -being of patients’ families and the global economy. The perception that many mental disorders have a chronic course is leading researchers to focus their research on the establishment of risk factors capable of predicting individual risk. The objective is to select subjects at high risk in order to test resources for the early diagnosis and even prevention of mental disorders among these subjects. Those with a history of mental disorder in first -degree relatives are considered to be at high risk for a particular disorder (Caspi et al., 1996) . Prospective longitudinal studies also demonstrate an association between behavior and mental disorders in adolescence and adulthood, such as an association between inhibi ted behavior and anxiety disorders (ADs) (Caspi et al., 1996) .", "113ADs are conditions that have significant continuity throughout life , causing personal and fam ily suffering and functional impairments and resulting in high social costs (Rapee et al., 2009) . Although the search for the biological substrate of ADs is necessary for the development of more effective therapies and, above all, preventive strategies through early diagnosis, experimental att empts to identify specific markers for different disorders remain unsuccessful (Quagliato et al., 2018a) . A common point of the various ADs is the fact that most of them arise from alterations in the normal trajectories of neurodevelopment, although the age of clinical diagnosis varies substantially from early childhood to adulthood (Rapee et al., 2009) . The characterization of normal neurodevel opment and deviant trajectories and processes has been the objective of a large number of studies carried out in recent years that seek to elucidate the origins of mental disorders (Fourrier, 2020; Walker, 2002) . This approach is based on hypotheses that ADs are the result of abnormal neurodevelopmental processes that start and exert effects long be fore they manifest themselves through behavioral, cognitive or emotional changes (Möller et al., 2015) . Underlying the emergence of ADs are environmental stressors in complex interactions with genetic factors already operating during the intrauterine per iod or the first years of life (Tsuang, 2004 ).", "The emergence of parental AD leads to a sevenfold rise in the offspring's AD (Turner et al., 1991) . It has been found that both the genetic transmission of anxiety vulnerabilities and environmental factors resulting from growing up with an anxious parent contribute to the overlap between the anxiety of parents and their off spring (McAdams et al., 2014) . Evaluating AD prodromes is useful for assessing the initial symptomatology of AD, evaluating early treatments and prevention steps, and elucidating risk and protective factors. One way to achieve these goals is t o study a 114population at high risk of developing AD. Therefore, one approach to the identification of early‐stage AD is through the assessment of the developmental pathways of cohorts at high risk for developing AD —or the offspring of parents with AD (OPAD). Few previous studies provided evidence that parents AD might be a risk factor for a mental illness in the offspring (Ayano et al., 2021; Lawrence et al., 2019; Rasic et al., 2014) However, to this date, none of these studies aimed to systematically assess how could a parent AD contribute to an abnormal neurodevelopment in the offspring. Thus, in this review article , we aim to answer the following questions: 1. How might parental anxiety symptoms affect early -childhood, middle -childhood, and adolescent offspring?", "2. How could a parent’s AD contribute to altered neurodevelopment and behavior in offspring?", "METHODS This systematic review was performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta -analyses (PRISMA) (Moher et al., 2009) and was conducted following an a priori established protocol (Supplemental Material). Database selection and search strategy Databases including PubMed, Web of Science, and PsycINFO were searched from inception to 26 October 2021. To avoid publication bias, non-English language and gray literature were included. A structured search strategy based on the PICOS framework was used (Richardson et al., 1995). Studies were included if they met the following criteria: (a) they enrolled adult parents with anxiety and their offspring; (b) parents’ anxiety symptoms were investigated in association with offspring outcomes; (c)preferentially, there was a control group; (d) the study evaluated offspring behavior, psychopathology or neurobiological markers; and (e) the study used any study design. The full search strategies are detailed in the supplementary materials. We also reviewed the reference lists of eligible studies and previous evidence summaries to identify additional literature.", "Two reviewers (LAQ and UM) working independently considered the potential eligibility of each of the abstracts retrieved via the search strategy. Full-text articles were obtained unless both reviewers decided that an abstract was ineligible. Each full- text report was assessed independently for final study inclusion. Disagreements about the inclusion of full-text articles were resolved by consensus.", "Data abstraction and qualit y assessment Data on study-, parent-, and offspring-related characteristics were abstracted onto a standardized form. The following variables were extracted from all studies: authors, year of publication, subject characteristics of the parent group, and subject 116characteristics of the offspring group. Data extraction was assessed independently by two reviewers (LAQ and UM), and disagreements were resolved by consensus. We contacted the authors of the studies to obtain any missing data. The risk of bias in the individual studies was assessed independently by two reviewers (LAQ and UM) using the Newcastle -Ottawa Scale risk of bias assessment tool (Lo et al., 2014) . Disagreements were resolved by consensus. LAQ, UM and AEN agreed on the final inclusion of studies in the systematic review, data abstraction, and quality assessment. The details of the quality assessment are reported in the Supplemental Material. RESULTS Based on the systematic search criteria described above, 2,587 citations wer e identified, of which 199 underwent a full -text review. A total of 47 papers representing individual studies met the inclusion criteria. The study selection process is illustrated in a PRISMA flow diagram (Figure 1).", "Study characteristics The key study characteristics are presented in Table 1. The total sample comprised n = 19 ,580 anxiety parents and n = 2,022 OPAD individuals. The sample size for individual studies ranged from n = 8 to 8,547 for AD and from n =8 to 8,547 for OPAD studies. The included r esearch represented data from 13 countries: the USA (k =14), the Netherlands (k=10), Canada (k=6), Germany (k=6), England (k=5), Australia (k=5), Norway (k=3), Finland (k=3), Belgium (k=2), Singapore (k=2), Austria (k=1), Brazil (k=1), and Bangladesh (k=1) .", "117The OPAD follow -up duration extended from 1 to 16 years beyond the index psychiatric assessment of the offspring. The mean age of the offspring ranged from and 2019. This was reflected in the categorical measurement used: the DSM -III or DSM -III-R, the DSM -IV or DSM -IV-TR and adaptions of both.", "Early childhood (0 -6 years old) Thirty -two studies provided data for early childhood, with a mean age ranging from 2 months to 3.5 years. Seventeen studies investigated the effects of maternal antenatal anxiety on offspring , 12 evaluated the impact of postnatal anxiety on OPAD , and 3 researched the effects of maternal anxiety pre - and postnatally . Prenatal Maternal anx iety throughout the second trimester was associated with a significant increase in internalizing symptoms (KJ et al., 2017) , such as greater negative affectivity (Agrati et al., 2015) of the child and negative temperament. It was also related to increased attention to fearful vocalizations at 9 months old (Otte et al., 2015) . Anxiety symptoms in the 2nd and 3rd trimesters were associated with excessive crying (Petzoldt et al., 2016) , behavior alterations (Loomans et al., 2011) and feeding problems (Petzoldt et al., 2016) in infants. Furthermore, infants tended to be rated as less alert and active than their peers (Farber et al., 1981) . However, one study that evaluated pregnant women in the 2nd and 3rd trimesters did not establish a direct and independent lin k between prenatal maternal anxiet y and child development (Bekkhus In the third quarter, maternal anxiety was associated with impaired psychomotor and cognitive development in infants (Grant et al., 2010) . Specifically, OPAD presented lower attention and orientation scores at 12 and 24 months (M et al., 2001) . Anxiety during the third quarter of pregnancy also predicted infant brain responses to emotional speech at two months old (Maria et al., 2020).", "Some studies evaluated biomarkers and imaging findings in OPAD. Maternal prenatal anxiety disorder was related to infants’ salivary cortisol levels, DNA methylation of 11HSD2, genetic variation of COMT, and late positive potentials amplitudes for neutral pictures (Cardenas et al., 2019; Grant et al., 2009; Heuvel et al., Postnatal Postnatal ADs were also a risk factor for the development of psychopathology in early-childhood OPAD. Children of parents with social anxiety disorder (SAD) presented poorer performance on cognitive and language tests at 30 months old (Castelli et al., 2015), blushed significantly more, and had elevated electrodermal activity throughout a social task procedure (Nikolić et al., 2016) . Furthermore, parental anxiety symptoms after birth were related to right hippocampal growth, whereas a negative association was demonstrated with left hippocampal volume at 6 months of life (Qiu et al., 2013). This fact could be related t o nonoptimal neurological conditions 119observed in OPAD, such as increased vulnerability to developing motor problems at 10 and 12 months (Kikkert and Middelburg, 2010) and reaching and g rasping and sensorimotor function deficits (Mughal et al., 2018) .", "Investigations also showed that postnatal anxiety is related to a more fearful temperament in children (Aktar et al. 2018) , and children with fearfulness exhibited significantly lower error -related brain activity (which, some studies suggest , might be a biomarker for anxiety) than their peers (Torpey et al., 2013) . Moreover, maternal post- and perinatal anxiety is a significant predictor of adverse social -emotional development in children (Polte et al., 2019) . Specifically, parental anxiety was correlated with negative affect and overcontrol, and certain parental behaviors, such as higher levels of criticism and lower levels of granting o f autonomy, were significantly related to higher anxiety symptoms in the 6 -year-old children of anxious parents (Polte Postnatal anxiety interferes with maternal -infant interaction (Stein et al., 2012) . Maternal anxiety, for instance, influences child sleep behav ior at 18 months after birth (Ystrom et al., 2017) . Furthermore, high postpartum maternal separation anxiety in mothers promoted overprotective behaviors, which resulted in increased behavior problems in their 2 - to 3-year-old children (Cooklin et al., 2013) . Interestingly , women with high postpartum maternal separation anxiety reported b etter bonding (i.e., more emotional feelings and care for the infant 2 –3 months postpartum) (Edhborg et al.,", "120Prenatal and post natal", "Maternal anxiety during the pre - and postnatal periods was independently associated with perceived infant temperamental difficulties (Henrichs et al., 2009) and unfavorable behaviors, such as distancing behavior, in offspring (Asselmann et al., 2018) . A further investigation confirmed these findings, demonstrating that ADs during pregnancy were correlated with behavioral and emotional problems in the offspring, while anxiety during the postnatal period was related to attention deficit problems (O’Connor et al., 2002) .", "Middle childhood (6 -12 years old) Eleven investigations provided data for the stage of middle childhood, with a mean age range from 6 to 11.2 years. However, some of these articles had a wide age range and therefore studied children throug hout early -middle childhood until adolescence (mean age range from 4 to 17 years). Four studies investigated the effects of prenatal anxiety in offspring, 4 investigated postnatal anxiety, and 3 investigated both.", "Prenatal Maternal anxiety during pregnancy at 15, 19, 25, 31, and 37 weeks gestation was associated with lower inhibitory control in girls and lower visuospatial working memory performance in boys and girls aged 6-9 years (Buss et al., 2011) . In an investigation of whether maternal somatic anxiety during pregnancy may affect neural fetal development, the results failed to exhibit an association (Bolea- Alamañac et al., 2019; Bolea-Alamanac et al., 2018). On the other hand, a positive correlation was found when children were 4 and 16 years old between maternal somatic anxiety during pregnancy and increased hyperactivity symptoms (Clavarino et Postnatal Genitors with a postnatal AD were a risk factor for children in middle childhood developing alterations in their behaviors. Parent al panic disorder (PD) was a significant predictor of ADs in offspring, being associated with SAD, PD, agoraphobia, and social phobia (Biederman et al., 2001). Having a socially anxious parent predicted the highest levels of child social anxiety (KL et al., 2018). Moreover, maternal anxiety disorders were a significant predictor of SAD (Sackl-Pammer et al., 2015) and depressive disorders in youth (Kujawa and Proudfit, 2014). However, in a study aiming to investigate the relation between parental attention biases to threat and children’s anxiety in middle childhood, no longitudinal associations were found (Waters, 2017). Prenatal and postnatal Investigations evaluating the impact of both prenatal and postnatal anxiety on offspring outcomes indicated that prenatal maternal anxiety was associated with a small increase in child internalizing difficulties (Barker et al., 2011). In another study , findings indicated that maternal prenatal anxiety symptoms enhance infants’ attention 122bias for threat, whereas maternal postnatal anxiety symptoms might be related to boys’ enhanced vigilance for distractors and girls’ enhanced vigilance for all socioemotional situations (EL et al., 2019) .", "Adolescence (12 -18 years old) Four studies provided d ata on the adolescent developmental stage, with a mean age range from 14 to 16 years. Two studies focused on prenatal anxiety , and 2 focused on postnatal anxiety.", "Prenatal One study evaluated the role of antenatal maternal anxiety on the dysregulation of the hypothalamic –pituitary –adrenal (HPA) axis and depressive symptoms during adolescence (Bergh et al., 2008) . This study investigated maternal anxiety at 12 –22, 23–32, and 32 –40 weeks of pregnancy, as well as HPA -axis function and depressive symptoms in 14 –15-year-old offspring. The results showed th at antenatal exposure to maternal anxiety at 12 –22 weeks of pregnancy was, in both sexes, associated with a high, flattened cortisol daytime profile ; however, in female adolescents only, it was associated with depressive symptoms. Another study investigate d ADHD deficits in adolescent boys as a result of antenatal anxiety evaluated at the 12th to 22nd weeks of pregnancy , and the results showed that the boys of this group of mothers had impaired processing speed (Bergh et al., 2006) .", "Postnatal A recent investigation evaluated the link between maternal anxiety and internalizing symptoms in adolescents over the course of 3 years(Havewala et al., 2019) . The findings suggested that maternal anxiety was associated with steeper increases in internalizing symptoms over time, but only for those with greater negative peer interactions(Havewala et al., 2019). In another study, 933 mother –child dyads from a community sample were investigated. Offspring were aged 14–17 years at baseline and followed up twice (Schreier et al., 2008). The results from this report found panic disorder and phobias in the children of mothers with generalized anxiety disorder (Schreier et al., 2008).", "DISCUSSION This systematic review is the first to demonstrate that prenatal and postnatal anxiety symptoms impact offspring, leading to alterations in neurodevelopment and behavior.", "Individuals diagnosed with anxiety show activation in their neuroimmune endocrine system, with an increase in various substances and molecules in the periphery, such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), inflammatory markers and free radicals (Quagliato et al., 2019, 2018b). These substances can cross the placental barrier, interfering with fetal brain development (Quagliato et al., 2019). Preclinical studies in rodents corroborate this fact, showing that when pregnant dams are exposed to perturbations that provoke activation of the neuroimmune endocrine 124system, such as anxiety symptoms, the ir offspring present behavioral sequelae, such as alterations in stress sensitivity, reward and cognition (Zager et al., 2014) However, these modifications depend on the gestational timing of the offspring’s exposu re (Jašarevic et al., 2017) .", "In this review , we showed that maternal anxiety during the second and third trimesters is related to an increase in anxiety behavior -related symptoms during early and middle childhood, such as negative temperament (Blair et al., 2011) , increased attention to fearful vocalizations (Otte et al., 2015) , and exce ssive crying in infants (Martini et al., 2015) . Furthermore, OPAD presented a decrease in alertness (Farber et al., 1981) , impaired psychomotor and cognitive development, and dysregulation of the HPA axis during adolescence. Preclinical literature demonstrates that murine offspring exposed to neuroimmune endocrine activation in early an d mid -gestation showed increased anxiety -like behaviors, prejudice in cognition, increased basal corticosterone levels and lower hippocampal glucocorticoid receptor expression, which confirms our findings ( Zager et al., 2012; 2014) . Although t he mechanisms and pathways responsible for these alterations need to be further explored, evidence points to disturbances in utero (Fragiadakis et al., 2016) .", "The placenta controls immune function and fetal exposure to endogenous and exogenous threats during gestation and serves as a neuroendocrine organ that contains hormones, growth factors and neuropeptides (von Rango et al., 2007; Wynne et al., 2006) In fact, the placenta has been identified as a 'third brain' due to its role in neuroendocri ne regulation and growth; it links the developing fetal brain and the mature maternal brain and is thus a sensitive functional tissue regulating the effects on neurodevelopment in the prenatal setting (von Rango et al., 2007) . The placenta displays a highly unusual pattern of DNA methylation throughout its gen ome, which 125(Keverne, 2014) has prompted studies to focus on understanding the i nfluence of the intrauterine and maternal environment on the placental epigenome and to investigate the connection between variation in placental DNA methylation and the effects on offspring (Emmery et al., 2017) . In particular, the neuroendocrine system has been the focus of placental epigenetics and neurodevelopmen t research, in particular the programming of the HPA axis. Importantly, the HPA axis regulates the response to stress as well as a variety of other systemic processes, including emotions and the immune system (Schlabritz -Loutsevitch et al., 2006) . The dysregulation of the HPA axis exhibited by OPAD during adolescence and the preclinical findings of increased basal corticosterone levels and lower hippocampal glucocorticoid receptor expression might be associated with corresponding alterations in promoter methylation, which suggests that the prenatal stress experience results in long -term epigenetic reprogramming of genes involved in the development of neurocircuitry (Maldonado - Ruiz et al., 2019; Udagawa and Hino, 201 6) Brain neurocircuitry is mostly formed during pregnancy (Warner, 2019) . The cellular development of the embryonic brain begins with neuroepithelial cells that give rise to all neurons and macroglia in the central nervous system (CNS) (Warner, 2019) . Microglia, the immune cells of the CNS, emerge from yolk sac progenitors and begin migrating to the brain through the ventriculus and meninges when neurons and other glial cells are only beginning to be produced (Paylor et al., 2016) . Microglia are thus present in the brain parenchyma when neural circuits start to assemble and modulate the formation of several neuronal tracts, which could be perturbed in OPAD. Different molecules and substances provided by anxious mothers might contribute to disturbances in OPAD neurocircuitry, since it has been demonstrated that inflammatory cytokines and neurotrophic factors might alter microglial cell function in 126utero (Quagliato and Nardi, 2018) . This could lead to an inadequate distribution of interneurons, contributing to modifications in offspring behavior at postnatal stages (Squarzoni et al. , 2014; Thion et al., 2019) (Figure 2).", "This review also provides evidence that not only prenatal anxiety but also postnatal anxiety symptoms might affect offspring neurodevelopment. Specifically , the results showed that children of genitors with postna tal ADs presented greater negative temperament, internalizing symptoms, and anxiety symptoms in early childhood, middle childhood, and adolescence (Havewala et al., 2019; Joseph et al., 1991; Kikkert HK Middelburg, 2010; Kujawa et al., 2014; Möller et al., 2016; Poole et al., 2018; Schreier and Heinrichs, 2010) . Complex interactions between the neonate and its mother occur in the postnatal period, and maternal behaviors such as nursing and grooming can strongly influence neurodevelopment (Buschert et al., 2016) . The major ity of neurodevelopment is completed by birth and is well established by the second or third year of life (Vianna et al., 2018) . Maturation of regions and circuits via synaptic refinement and myelination begins in the neonatal period and continues throughout childhood and adolescence into early adulthood (Lee and Chung, 2019) . This reflects the refinement of complex cognitive processes, such as attention orienting, timing, working memory, and inhibitory control (Cruz e t al., 2011) . Therefore, depending on the timing of anxiety , parental alterations during postnatal neurodevelopment have the potential to affect the neural and cognitive development of offspring across the life span.", "As soon as children are born, they b egin learning to use their senses to explore the world around them. Neuronal plasticity refers to structural and functional changes in neuronal circuits in response to experience (Negrón -Oyarzo et a l., 2016) . Synaptic plasticity can occur through changes in synaptic strength as well as through the 127 addition/removal of synapses (Wu et al., 2015) . Experience -dependent plasticity is not limited to synapses or even to neurons. In fac t, most if not every component of the nervous system exhibits robust, reproducible responses to experience (Schafer et al., 2012) . Thus, in addition to synaptogenesis, dendritic reorganization, and neurogenesis, other nonneuronal components are sensitive to exp erience, resulting, for example, in angiogenesis, increased myelination, and astrocytic hypertrophy (Wu et al., 2015) . Cognitive theories emphasize threat prioritization as a critical mechanism in the development of child and adult anxiety (Van Bockstaele et al., 2014) . More precisely, attentional bias can play a central role in ADs, described as the preferentia l allocation of attention to threatening stimuli over other categories of stimuli (Van Bockstaele et al., 2014) . This process might be affected by synaptic plasticity , which could reinforce the allocation of attention to threatening stimuli instead of a neutral stimulus , contribu ting to OPAD alterations in behavior.", "The present review had a number of limitations. First, since most OPAD had not yet passed through the peak risk period for developing AD (Lijster et al., 201 7), the developmental risk patterns found to occur in OPAD should be interpreted with caution. Second , the overall results may have been affected by the methodological heterogeneity of the studies, and because of the heterogeneous outcomes it wasn’t possible to perform a meta -analysis. Our quality analysis of the evidence, however, showed a methodologically robust corpus of studies. Finally, although we identified studies from North America, South America, Europe and Western Asia, our own inclusion crite ria and the current status of the field may limit the cross ‐cultural validity and applicability of our findings to the global youth population. Furthermore, as much as we planned to include studies in mothers and fathers in this systematic review, the majority of included studies only examined AD in mothers.", "128 In de termining at -risk cohorts, our study stresses the importance of developmental consistency in recognizing the risk of psychopathology and following a developmental structure. However, in ultra -high-risk offspring, upscaling developmental research requires m ore robust methodologies. The assessment and reporting, for example, of cumulative data from complementary information sources (e.g., caregivers, teachers and self -reports) could increase the accuracy of outcomes. Our evidence supports current developmenta l psychopathology models and extends them. However, further research is required to improve the reliability of the evidence. Specifically, future research that explores the role of (i) the underlying epigenetic pathways in the developmental stage of OPAD, (ii) the mediating and moderating factors leading to the development of AD, and (iii) the nonclinical symptoms of resilience/protective factors in OPAD should contribute to the field. We found that signs of pre - and postnatal anxiety contribute to an incre ase in offspring psychopathology and neurodevelopmental alterations. This reiterates the importance of recognizing individuals' family mental health status as an indicator of vulnerability to mental health disorders. The high -risk profile of OPAD and its d ynamic nature throughout development should be recognized by health professionals who engage with adult individuals diagnosed with anxiety but also by those who work with children and youth. Information on the factors that may put offspring at high risk of developing maladaptive behaviors should also be given to parents with OPAD and co - caregivers. Furthermore, this study offers a promising framework for using neurodevelopmental “opportunity windows” linked to optimally needs -matched interventions. In that way, a step towards early intervention and primary prevention for OPAD could be further researched , contributing to improved public health policies.", "129 FIGURE", "Figure 1 - PRISMA Flow Diagram Records identified through database searching (n = 2,587 ) Screening Included Eligibility IdentificationAdditional records identified through other sources Records after duplicates removed Records screened (n = 2,433 ) Records excluded Full-text articles assessed for eligibility (n = 199 ) Full-text articles excluded, with reasons studies that didn’t evaluate offspring outcomes.", "21= Studies that evaluated anxiety disorder parents with other comorbities 5= review articles 3= animal studies 2= in vitro studies evaluated sibilings and not genitors 45=Studies included in qualitative synthesis 130Figure 2 - Several molecules and substances provided by anxious mothers might contribute to disturbances in OPAD neurocircuitry.

This could lead to an inadequate distribution of interneurons, contributing to alterations in offspring behavior at postnatal stages. Furthermore, anxiety during pregnancy might cause placental DNA methylation, which is associated with HPA axis. The dysreg ulation of the HPA axis exhibited by OPAD might be associated with corresponding alterations in promoter methylation, suggesting that the prenatal stress experience results in long -term epigenetic reprogramming of genes involved in the development of neuro circuitry.", "131 Table 1.

ANALISANDO O TRANSTORNO DE PÂNICO POR MEIO DE UMA", "ABORDAGEM ESPECTRAL Os critérios diagnósticos em psiquiatria classicamente são baseados em modelos descritivos fenomenológicos, conforme dispostos nos principais manuais de classificação: o DSM e a Classificação Internacional de Doenças (CID) (AMERICAN PSYCHIATRIC ASSOCIATION, 2013; FUNG; XU; BODENREIDER, 2020). A operacionalização de tais critérios foi iniciada em 1980, a partir do lançamento do DSM-I II (AMERICAN PSYCHIATRIC ASSOCIATION, 1980), o que foi de grande importância para superar dificuldades históricas da nosologia psiquiátrica: a ausência de uma linguagem comum para classificação das condições psiquiátricas e, portanto, uma baixa concordância diagnóstica entre avaliadores (STABEL et al., 2013). Tal progresso da nosologia psiquiátrica foi em grande parte responsável pela melhoria do sistema diagnóstico, permitindo uma comunicação mais adequada entre os profissionais de saúde e pacientes, além de estar relacionada ao s avanços nas áreas de pesquisa em saúde mental (MAYES; HORWITZ, 2005).", "O embasamento teórico do modelo no qual o DSM está inserido baseia-se no conceito de interação epistêmica (KENDLER, 2009). Essa ideia pressupõe que o processo científico avança progressivamente rumo a uma verdade final por meio da autocorreção e do enriquecimento teórico (KENDLER, 2009). Ou seja, o DSM seria um modelo que, apesar de falho, a cada atualização tornar-se-i a mais próximo de uma apresentação fidedigna dos transtornos mentais. Apesar disso, existem diversos critérios questionáveis nesse modelo descritivo fenomenológico. Particularmente, as dificuldades relacionadas aos modelos atuais estão baseadas em diversos conceitos, muitas vezes representando entraves significativos na pesquisa e na prática clínica, dos quais destacam-se: (a) a ausência de critérios objetivos como ferramentas diagnósticas, além do relato clínico; (b) a instabilidade do curso dos transtornos mentais, frequentemente apresentando continuidades homo e heterotípicas ao longo da vida dos indivíduos acometidos; (c) as possibilidades de apresentações fenotípicas heterogêneas agrupadas na mesma categórica diagnóstica; (d) a capacidade de múltiplas condições apresentarem fenótipos clínicos semelhantes, apresentando uma distinção com baixa validação, falhando em reconhecer possíveis mecanismos fisiopatológicos comuns; (e) a dificuldade de estabelecer dicotomizações para apresentações muitas vezes dimensionais, criando empecilhos ao diagnóstico e determinando artificialmente a existência de casos subsindrômicos; e (f) as 160dificuldades em avançar no campo da pesquisa de marcadores biológicos utilizando o sistema classificatório vigente (COOPER, 2004; ARTIGAS -PALLARÉS; PAULA - PÉREZ, 2015) . Tais críticas aos sistemas de classificação vigentes impulsionaram a busca por métodos alternativos de classificação de transtornos mentais . Sendo assim, foi lançado em 2010 o Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) – uma iniciativa do National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) que visa classificar os transtornos mentais tendo como base a sua fisiopatologia (INSEL et al., 2010) . Ao propor a integração entre a neurociência moderna com a psicopatologia, o RDoC tem a intenção de criar um sistema classificatório que parte de mecanismos biológicos e finda na ma nifestação clínica (INSEL et al., 2010) . O RDoC visa construir uma nova classificação de psicopatologia baseada nas dimensões da neurobiologia e comportamento, a fim de promover a compreensão e o tratamento dos transtornos mentais (INSEL et al., 2010) . Ademais, um objetivo central do RDoC é compreender os processos do neurodesenvolvimento subjacentes às origens dos transtornos mentais (MORRIS; CUTHBERT, 2012) . Esse referencial teórico tem a intenção de permitir a identificação de agrupamentos transdiagnósticos de pacientes com assinaturas biológicas semelhantes (MORRIS; CUTHBERT, 2012) .", "Uma das assinaturas biológicas estudadas pelo RDoC são os biomarcadores periféricos (MORRIS; CUTHBERT, 2012) . Apesar de biomarcadores periféricos serem comumente reconhecidos por estarem alterados em uma ampla gama de transtor nos mentais, essas alterações não respeitam os limites diagnósticos e são bastante variáveis entre pessoas com o mesmo diagnóstico fenotípico (BEAUCHAINE; CONSTANTINO, 2017) . Isso também é verdade para as citocinas. Esses marcadores inflamatórios se encontram alterados não apenas no TP, como também em divers os outros transtornos mentais, como a esquizofrenia, a depressão maior, o transtorno bipolar, o transtorno do espectro autista, dentre outros (MÜLLER; ACKENHEIL, 1998) . Dadas as complexidades dos transtornos mentais é improvável que um único biomarcador auxilie no diagnóstico e em decisões terapêuticas dos pacientes. A investigação de diversos biomarcadores potenciais em uma ampla gama de transtornos, por outro lado, po de contribuir para a compreensão de microalterações de neurocircuitos envolvidos de maneira transdiagnóstica nos transtornos psiquiátricos. Sendo assim, o sétimo manuscrito desta tese exemplifica como as citocinas devem ser percebidas de um ponto de vista transdiagnóstico, uma vez que 161discute alterações desses marcadores inflamatórios no suicídio. Já no oitavo estudo desta tese, verificamos se o teste de inalação ao dióxido de carbono (CO2) , um experimento comumente associado ao TP, pode ser visto de uma ma neira espectral e no nono trabalho , investigamos os mais comuns biomarcadores periféricos que estão presentes nos mais variados transtornos mentais.", "1622.6.1.

Although accumulating evidence suggests that some inflammatory processes play a role in the pathophysiology of mental disorders, very few studies have evaluated cytokine levels in indiv iduals who have attempted suicide. The aim of the present study was to systematically review and update the cytokine profile of suicide attempters and discuss some possibilities for future research. Methods: This systematic review followed Preferred Report ing Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta -Analyses guidelines. Studies investigating cytokines in suicidal individuals were systematically searched in the MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and Cochrane Library databases. Results: Thirty -two studies involving measurements of cytokines in suicide attempters were included in this review article. Although increased serum levels of some inflammatory markers, such as IL-6 and TNF-α, were reported in suicidal subjects compared with the levels observed in controls, there were con flicting results regarding interleukins in association with suicidal behavior. The discrepant findings in the existing literature regarding suicide and cytokines may be attributable to variability in assay procedures or to differences in the study populati ons.", "Conclusions: There is a role for interleukins in the physiopathology of suicide and in individuals at increased risk of suicide. Cytokines are linked to neurogenesis, microglial activation, and tryptophan metabolism. However, the number of studies exa mining the link between cytokines and suicidal behavior is relatively minimal; these studies have small sample sizes and they use a variety of methods. Therefore, to draw firm conclusions about the link between inflammatory interleukins and suicide, larger , more methodologically rigorous studies with larger samples sizes are required.

Because of a large body of evidence supporting its different etiology, suicidal behavior disorder has been classified as a distinct psychiatric category in the DSM -5(Al-Haddad et al., 2019) . Therefore, unraveling the pathophysiology of suicide is a priority for public health. Evidence shows that cytokines might have a role in the pathophysiologic mechanism of many psychiatric illnesses. Major depressive disorder (MDD), panic disorder, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, alcohol use disorder, borderline personality disord er, eating disorders, and a variety of other illnesses have been linked to abnormal levels of proinflammatory cytokines (Brown and Patterson, 2011; Quagliato and Nardi, 2018) . Furthermore, several lines of evid ence point to a connection between inflammation and suicidal behavior. For starters, epidemiological studies have found a link between allergies, asthma, and suicidality (Goodwin and Eaton, 2005) . Second, clinical case studies have discovered that people who are given cytokines develop suicidal behavior (Fragoso et al., 2010) . Third, higher levels of inflammatory markers in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma have been found in suicidal individuals compared to the levels in nonsuicidal individuals (Lindqvist et al., 2011) .", "In the past decade, different meta -analyses have aimed to assess cytokine levels in individuals exhibiting suicidal behavior (Black and Miller, 2015; Ducasse et al., 2015) . Although these studies found an increase in inflammatory interleukin levels related to suicidality, most robust interleukin markers associated with this behavior were highly heterogeneous in these investigations. Furthermore, a large amount of information has been published recently. Based on the above, we reviewed the evidence of current literature on cytokine prof iles in individuals exhibiting suicidal behavior and identified gaps in the literature to inform future research.", "Primary outcome:", "•Verification of the possible association between cytokines and suicidal behavior. Secondary outcomes:", "•Determination of how c ytokines might influence suicide behavior.", "•Elucidation of the molecular basis linking interleukins and suicide. METHODS We followed Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta -Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines for this systematic review (Moher D, Liberati A, Tetzlaff J, 2009) . Studies investigating cytokines in individuals exhibiting suicidal behavior were systematically searched for in the MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and Cochrane Library databases in July 2021. The search protocol was developed based on PRISMA and 166 World Health Organization (WHO) Review Protocol Template Guidelines where applicable for this systematic review, as discussed in the Supplementary Materials. The references cited in the systematically searched articles were checked manually. In an effort to avoid publication bias, the search also included non -English language studies and gray literature (for example, conference abstracts). The search used a broadly structured strategy based on the Problem, Intervention, Comparator, Outcome, and Setting (PICOS) framework (Schardt et al., 2007) , where the problem was suicidal behavior; the intervention/exposure was the measure of cytokines in the blood, postmortem tissue, or CSF; the comparison was the presence of absence of suicidal behavior; the outcome was an assoc iation between interleukins and suicide symptoms; and any type of study design was allowed. Search terms included various combinations of terms for cytokines and suicide (Supplementary Material). Studies were selected for data extraction and analysis based on the following inclusion criteria: 1) reported measurements of cytokines in the blood, CSF, or postmortem brain; 2) included a patients who a) had active suicidal ideation, b) had a history of attempted suicide, or c) had completed suicide; and 3) evalu ated a control population of individuals who were either a) patients with psychiatric disorders without suicidality or b) healthy controls. Studies were excluded if 1) they possessed significant overlap in patient or control population samples, 2) they wer e review articles, 3) they were genetic studies that did not quantify cytokine levels or 4) they were not performed in humans.", "The following variables were extracted from all the studies: authors, year of publication, characteristics of participants in the affected and control groups, and characteristics of experiments involving cytokines. Data were extracted by two independent authors, and disagreements were settled by consensus and discussion. The methodological quality of the included studies was assesse d independently by two of the authors using the Newcastle –Ottawa scale (Stang, 2010) (Supplementary Material). Any discrepancies were resolved by consensus with a third reviewer.", "RESULTS A total of 1,291 studies were identified, and 32 articles met our search criteria (Figure 1). Twenty -four articles investigated cytokines in blood samples of suicide attempters and controls, four investigations assessed interleukins in postmortem samples of suicide completers, and four studies evaluated cytokines in CSF samples. In total, 3,054 suicide patients and controls were assessed. Findings for individual cytokines are summ arized below and in Table 1.", "Tumor necrosis factor -α (TNF - α).", "Higher TNF -α levels were linked to suicidal conduct, suicidal thoughts, and suicide in three of sixteen investigations (Janelidze et al., 2011 ; Pandey, 2017; Pandey et al., 2012) . Only one small study of depressive teenagers with strong suicidal ideation revealed lower levels of TNF -α than depressed nonideators demonstrated (Gabbay et al., 2009) . In another study, TNF -α levels were higher in patients with MDD than in controls but did not distinguish patients with suicidal MDD from nonsuicidal MDD 167 nonattempters (Li et al., 2013) . The other investigations found no group differences with respect to TNF - (Bay-Richter et al., 2015; Ganan ça et al., 2021; Huang and Lee, 2007; Karlović et al., 2012; Keaton et al., 2019; Lindqvist et al., 2009; Martinez et al., 2012; O’Donovan et al., 2013; Odebrecht Vargas et al., 2013; Su et al., 2020; Tonelli Interleukin -2 (IL-2) and interleukin -2 soluble receptor (sIL -2R). Nine studies assessed IL -2 and/or sIL -2R in patients with suicidal behavior. In all investigations that investigated these cytokines, depressed suicide attempters had lower levels of them than depressed nonattempter s and healthy controls h ad (Janelidze et al., 2011; Kim et al., 2008) . In studies investigating suicidal thoughts, no variations across groups were discovered (Mendlovic et al., 1999) . Among the two studies that measured sIL -2R, one of them (Nässberg er and Träskman -Bendz, 1993) found higher levels in suicide attempters with mood disorders or other psychiatric diagnoses than in healthy controls. However, the other study did not find any significant alteration in suicide attempters and controls (Rothenhäusler et al., 2006) . Some studies found no diff erence in IL -2 levels between patients with previous suicide attempts and healthy controls (Conejero et al., 2019; Jha et al., 2020; Keaton et al., 2019; Su et al., Interleukin -6 (IL-6).", "The cytokine most frequently associated with suicidality was IL -6, which was elevated in participants in eight (Bay-Richter et al., 2015; Janelidze et al., 2011; Karlović et al., 2012; Lindqvist et al., 2009; O’Donovan et al., 2013; Pandey, 2017; Pandey et al., 2012; Priya et al., 2016) of the twenty -two studies. Only one study (Kim et al., 2008) found lower IL -6 levels in suicide attempters. However, in this study, blood was taken from depressed suicide attempters when they arrived in the emergency room, whereas in the comparator g roups —and in all other studies in which this cytokine was measured in blood or CSF —specimens were taken in the morning after participants had fasted. This might have been a problem because IL -6 has a biphasic diurnal fluctuation, with morning and evening p eaks (Uchino et al., 2006) . The remaining studies found no differences in IL -6 CSF or blood levels in adult suicide attempters compared with controls (Cáceda et al., 2018; Coryell et al., 2018; Eidan et al., 2019; Ganança et al., 2021; Isung et al., 2012; Jha et al., 2020; Keaton et al., 2019; Martinez et al., 2012; Odebrecht Vargas et al., 2013; Su et al., 2020) , in adolescents with active suicidal ideation compared with depressed, nonsuicidal peers (Gabbay et al., 2009) , or with regard to RNA expression in prefrontal cortex (Pandey et al., 2018; Tonelli et al., 2008) of patients with previous suicide attempts compared with that of controls. Interleukin -1β (IL-1β).", "Sixteen studies assessed the role of IL -1β in suicidal behavior. Four of them found higher levels of IL -1β related to suicidal ideation and behavior in samples of postmortem tissue, CSF and/or serum (Bastos et al., 2017; Monfrim et al., 2014; Pandey, 2017; Pandey et al. , 2012) . However, two investigations found lower levels of IL-1β in suicidal patients than in controls (Coryell et al., 2018; Ganança et al., 2021) , and some studies did not find any differences between suicidal attempte rs and nonsuicidal participants (Bay-Richter et al., 2015; Conejero et al., 2019; Gabbay et al., 2009; Huang and Lee, 2007; Jha et al., 2020; Keaton e t al., 2019; Kim et al., 2008; Lindqvist et al., 2009; Su et al., 2020; Tonelli et al., 2008) .", "168 Interferon -γ (INF- γ).", "Five studies evaluated interferon -γ in suicidal patients. In one study, higher levels of IFN-γ were found in depressed patients with suicidal ideation compared to the levels in depressed nonsuicidal and healthy controls only (Mendlovic et al., 1999) . There was no difference between the levels of INF -γ in suicidal su bjects and controls in several studies (Eidan et al., 201 9; Gabbay et al., 2009; Keaton et al., 2019; Kim et al., 2008) . Transforming growth factor -β (TGF - β).", "Three studies assessed the role of TGF -β in patients who demonstrated suicidal behavior, but none found a specific association between this cytokine and individuals who exhibited suicidal behavior (Kim et al., 2008; Lee and Kim, 2010; O’Donovan et Interleukin -13 (IL -13).", "Three studies assessed IL -13 in patients who had suicidal behavior (Keaton et al., 2019; Pandey et al., 2018; Tonelli et al., 2008) , and only one of them found higher levels of IL -13 in the Brodmann area of postmortem samples from suicide completers (Tonelli et al., 2008) .", "Interleukin -4 (IL-4).", "Six studies investigated the role of IL -4 in patients who exhibited suicidal behavior. IL - 4 was higher in the Brodmann area of suicide victim s in a postmortem study (Tonelli et al., 2008) . Four studies found no differences in IL-4 in patie nts with suicidal behavior (Gabbay et al., 2009; Keaton et al., 2019; Kim et al., 2008; Mendlovic et al., 1999) compared to that in controls, and one investigation demonstrated that subjects with suicidal behavior presented lower levels of IL -4 than controls (Jha et al., 2020) . Interleukin -8 (IL-8).", "Six studies assessed IL -8 levels in suicidal attempters and controls. Low IL -8 was seen in one (Isung et al., 2012) study of suicide attempters, and low levels of IL -8 were negatively correlated with suicide risk (Keaton et al., 2019) . However, some investigations did not demonstrate any differences between suicide attempters and healthy controls (Bay-Richter et al., 2015; Jha et al., 2020; Lindqvist et al., 2009; Pandey et al., 2018) .", "Interleukin -10 (IL -10).", "The majority of studies investigating IL -10(Huang and Lee, 2007; Jha et al., 2020; Keaton et al., 2019; Li -Ching et al., 2007; Mendlovic et al., 1999; O’Donov an et al., 2013) did not find any associations among suicidal ideation, attempts, or suicide for this cytokine. However, two postmortem studies (Pandey et al., 2018; Shinko et al., 2020) found low levels of IL -10 in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of individuals who died by suicide compared to that of controls.", "DISCUSSION Our findings suggest that cytokine levels are abnormal in patients with suicidality. Specifically, IL-6, IL-1β and TNF -α were associated with suicidal behavior. However, even the most robust interleukins associated with suicidality were highly heterogeneous among the studies included in this systematic review. The following are some possible explanations for discrepancies be tween the investigations: 1) Different phenotypes of suicidal behavior may be associated with different biological 169 inflammatory patterns. For instance, there is evidence that IL -6 levels differed between suicidal and nonsuicidal patients, and this interleu kin was correlated with depression severity but only in the presence of melancholic rather than atypical features (Karlović et al., 2012) . 2) The comparability of various cytokine indices is debatable; for example, plasma and CSF IL -6 levels were found to be unrelated in one study (Isung et al., 2014) . 3) Confounders are difficult to control because a variety of factors, including age, sex, socioeconomic status, acute exercise, excessive caffeine use, BMI, smoking, sleep quality, alcohol use, psychotropic medications, and medical comorbidities, influence blood cytokine and soluble cytokine receptor levels (O’Connor et al., 2009) . 4) Individual responses to inflammatory stimuli may be influenced significantly by genetic and epigenetic factors (Kang et al., 2013) . 5) Interleukin detection methods are highly heterogeneous.", "The standardization of cytokine detection methods, which were extremely diverse in the studies included in this review, is a particular obstacle to be solved. Although most research utilized ELISAs or comparable antibody arrays, particular methodological aspects, such as assay sensitivity, usage of plasma or serum, anticoagulation, centrifugation procedure, and time of day for sample collection, varied greatly between investigations. There has been substantial debate over how to standardize these procedures for clinical practice, given that there are significant variations in published measurements, even when identical commercial kits are used. Fewer studies, however, have attempted to develop recommendations for interleukin identification in patients with mental disorders (Lutsenko et al., 2017) ; henc e, this topic deserves additional attention in future research.", "There are several cofounders for cytokine research thus far, but if all these challenges are adequately met in future research, interleukin studies might help to elucidate part of the pathophy siology of suicide. Increased circulating cytokines may have an impact on the brain and behavior via a variety of methods, including entrance through \"leaky\" areas or active transport (Pan et al., 2011) . External variables, such as stress -induced microglial activation, might also instigate intrabrain cytokine production (Frank et al., 2007) . Increased cytokine levels may increase suicidal behavior by altering particular brain regions or neurochemical processes linked to suicidality. Structural alterations in the left superior temporal gyrus, rectal gyrus, and caudate nucleus, as well as functional changes in the anterior and posterior cingulate, were linked to suicidal behavior in a meta -analysis of twelve neuro imaging studies (van Heeringen et al., 2014) . This distribution overlaps with cytokine -targeted brain regions, such as the basal ganglia and the anterior cingulate cortex (Miller et al., 2013) . Left -sided activation in the inferior frontal gyrus and dorsal anterior cingulate was seen on fMRI scans acquired in patients with hepatitis C treated with IFN compared to untreated patients during a visuospatial att ention task (Capuron et al., 2005) .", "Suicidal individuals have been found to have lower brain volumes in the prefrontal cortex (Ding et al., 2015) , perhaps due to neuroplasticity impairment. Proinflammatory cytokines are linked to a reduction in neurogenesis, as well as reduced BDNF expression (Homberg et al., 2014) . BDNF, the most relevant neuroplasticity mediator, affects neuronal survival, growth and neurogenesis (Bramham and Messaoudi, 2005) . BDNF has also been linked to suicidal behaviors. Suicides have been linked to decreased prefrontal brain BDNF mRNA and protein levels, regardless of a person’s mental illness (Dwivedi et al., 2003) . Furthermore, suicidal individuals exhibit higher DNA methylation related to the BDNF gene (Keller et al., 2011) , as well as lower peripheral BDNF levels. Increased cortisol levels are linked to reduced volumes in the 170 prefrontal cortex and other brain regi ons, suggesting that volumetric alterations might be mediated by cytokine effects on corticoid production (Goshen and Yirmiya, 2009) . Postmortem methods require a priori selection of a single or few brain areas for research and hence are unable to provide larger -scale information r egarding regional connectivity. The few studies that looked at brain inflammatory components linked to completed suicide all found evidence of increased inflammation, as measured by cytokine activity in the prefrontal cortex (Pandey et al., 2012; Tonelli et al., 2008) , microglial priming and macrophage recruitment (Torres -Platas et al., 2014) , and astrocyte hypertrophy in the dorsal anterior cingulate (Torres -Platas et al., 2014) . One investigation (Tonelli et al., 2008) found increased mRNA expression of IL -4 and IL - 13, as well as higher mRNA and protein expression of IL -1, IL -6, and TNF, in individuals who completed suicide and who had a range of diagnoses compared to the findings of normal controls who died of other causes (Pandey et al., 2012) . Increased microglial priming, macrophage recruitment, and hypertrophic astrocytes were found in the dorsal anterior cingulate of depressed suicidal indivi duals compared to the findings of psychiatrically healthy controls. However, because all individuals were depressed suicidal persons, no conclusions could be drawn regarding specificity for suicidal behavior as opposed to depression (Torres -Platas et al., 2011) . Toll -like receptors (TLRs), on the other hand, were used to compare depressed suicidal individuals, nondepressed suicidal individuals, depres sed suicidal individuals, and controls in a study (Pandey et al., 2014) . TLRs are innate immune receptors that detect pathogen - or damage -related molecular patterns and trigger microglia to produce proinflammatory cytokines (Pandey et al., 2014) . TLR3 and TLR4 mRNA expression was higher in all depressed patients than in controls, regardless of the manner of death, while TLR3 and TLR4 protein lev els were higher in individuals in both suicide groups than participants in the nonsuicide group, regardless of diagnosis, suggesting specificity for this receptor (Pandey et al., 2014) .", "Effects on mo noaminergic neurotransmission, which has been linked to both depression and suicidal conduct, are one way by which cytokines may impact suicidal behavior (Anguelova et al., 2003) . There is evidence that suggests genetic serotonin transporter (SERT) variations are more vulnerable to the effects of proinflammatory cytokines. For example, hepatitis C patie nts with the SLC6A4 (SERT) genetic variant are more likely to have a depressive episode following INF treatment (Lotrich et al., 2009) . Furthermore, cytokines might activate the enzyme indoleamine -2,3- dioxygenase (IDO), which catalyzes the synthesis of kynurenine from tryptophan. The activation of this route might decrease the production of serotonin, the other tryptophan product downstream (Maes et al., 1993) . Many of the cytokines linked to suicide (Lindqvist et al., 2011, 2009; Tonelli et al., 2008) are rec ognized IDO stimulators. High levels of kynurenine, on the other hand, have been linked to suicide attempts without evidence of tryptophan depletion, implying that kynurenine or its metabolites, quinolinic acid and kynurenic acid, may influence mood and su icide risk by directly affecting the brain (Sublette et al., 2013) . A study found that therapy with IFN increased kynurenine, quinolinic acid, and kynurenic acid levels in CSF without lowering CSF tryptophan levels in CSF (Raison et al., 2010) . Furthermore, quinolinic acid, an NMDA receptor agonist, has been associated with suicidal behavior (Bryleva and Brundin, 2017) , while ketamine, a recognized NMDA receptor antagonist, has been shown to decrease suicidality (Bay-Richter et al., 2015) .", "171 The numbe r of studies examining the link between cytokines and suicidal behavior is relatively minimal, with small sample sizes and a variety of methods. As a result, this review was nonquantitative in nature, and no inferences regarding impact sizes could be drawn . Different ways to attempt or complete suicide may indicate disparities in lethality and purpose, as well as different inflammatory patterns. Suicide techniques were not controlled in the majority of the studies in our evaluation. Interactions with other biological markers linked to suicidal behavior, such as monoamines or HPA axis mediators, might also result in possible confounds that were not considered in most of the research included.", "Interleukin research could potentially follow the path of genetic e pidemiology, where underpowered studies with limited reproducibility have gradually been replaced by much larger multicenter consortia studies that can control for the number of comparisons performed and yield more reproducible data (Scherer, 2017) . Despite the growing number of articles, our data show that this has not yet occurred in the peripheral marker field; aside from weak trends in increased sample size and decreased frequency in cross -disorder comparisons, hardly any of the literature patterns regarding cytokines appear to have changed significantly over a 20 -year period.", "There is a role for interleukins in the physiopathology of suicide and in an increased risk of suicide. However, to make firm conclusions on the link between inflammatory interleukins and suicide, larger, more methodologically rigorous research is required. Such research would lead to a better understanding of how these many cofounders relate d to immunology might interact, as well as the discovery of potentially modifiable proximal suicide risk factors.", "172FIGURE", "Figure 1 - PRISMA flow diagram.

Inflammatory interleukins can reduce relevant monoamine precursors by activating the enzyme indoleamine 2,3 - dioxygenase (IDO), which converts tryptophan, the primary precursor for serotonin, into kynurenine. Activated microglia can convert kynurenine to quinolinic acid (QUIN), which binds to the glutamate N - methyl -d aspartate receptor (NMDAR). QUIN has been associated with suicidal behavior Furthermore, cytokines can then lead to reduced brain -derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels and excitotoxicity. Inflammation -related effects on BDNF can also affect neurogenesis and long -term potentiation.

One way to better understand the pathophysiology of psychiatric disorders is to investigate challenges that mimic mental disorder symptoms. A number of reports have shown that the inhalation of carbon dioxide mixtures might cause greater anxiety responses in patients with panic disorder than in healthy controls. However, the evidence is sparse in regard to comparing the effects of the carbon dioxide challenge test across psychiatric illnesses. We performed a systematic review to evaluate (i) the evidence regarding differences in CO2 test response in patients with mental illnesses vs. controls and (ii) whether CO2 responsiveness is similar across different diagnoses. Following PRISMA guidelines, we systematically searched the PubMed, PsycInfo, and Science Direct databases. The review included original research in mental health patients that investigated CO2 challenge tests in patients versus healthy controls. Studies without a control group, studies involving patients with a comorbid psychiatric diagnosis, animal studies, and in vitro studies were excluded. Twenty -eight articles met the inclusion criteria for the systematic review. A meta -analysis demonstrated that the odds of carbon dioxide - induced panic attacks were significantly higher in patients with panic disorder and those with premenstrual dysphoric disorder than in healthy contro ls. This suggests that the CO2 challenge test might contribute to a transdiagnostic approach for psychiatric illness.", "197INTRODUCTION", "Despite the fact that identifying the biological substrate of mental illnesses is critical for the development of more ef fective therapies and, most importantly, early detection techniques, experimental attempts to discover particular markers for various disorders have been ineffective (Clark et al., 2 017). As a result, existing therapies are symptom - based rather than disease -modifying, and response rates are poor (Gottesman and Goul d, 2003) . Such unfavorable results are expected, at least in part, due to a lack of specificity of global alterations in brain biology for certain clinical disorders (Gordon, 2016) . In fact, the symptoms and clinic al presentations of many diseases are nonspecific, and mechanisms to better evaluate the pathophysiology of mental disorders should be identified.", "One way to better understand the pathophysiology of psychiatric disorders is to investigate biological challe nges that could mimic mental health symptoms. Biological challenges have become more important in modern medicine, allowing for precise diagnosis and distinction from other diseases (Kapur et al., 2012) . In the absence of reliable laboratory -based testing, diagnosis is vulnerable to both observer bias and judgment error (Kapur et al., 2012) . In the same way that traditional medicine has identified biological measures that can distinguish healthy from unhealthy people, psychiatric research has identified biological and laboratory measures that can separate patien ts from nonpatients, such as abnormal P300 in patients with schizophrenia and potentiated error -related negativity in those with anxiety disorders (Hajcak et al., 2003; Allen et al., 2009) . Despite the potential value of utilizing biological indicators to diagnose psychiatric disease, the discipline has been slow to adopt these measures. Generally, these laboratory tests have not been develo ped into diagnostic tools or have been hastily discarded before the validity of the measurements can be proven (Kapur et al., 2012) . Psychiatric evaluation and diagnosis are currently time -consuming and reliant on behavioral and self -report measures, both of which are susceptible to self -report bias and underreporting, as well as poor patient insight (Kapur et al., 2012) . In recent years, academic researchers and psychiatry practitioners have urged the integration of biological and laboratory measurements into the diagnosis of mental disorders (Kapur et al., 2012) . The inhalation of carbon dioxide (CO2) test is one of the most commonly used challenges to provoke panic attacks in the literature, and therefore, it is a laboratory challenge related to panic disorder (PD) (Amaral et al., 201 3). Of the numerous agents capable of inducing panic in patients with panic disorder, CO2 offers significant advantages. It is easily administered, well tolerated, and one of the most reliable panicogens (Amaral et al., 2013) . Although in the last 30 years, several lines of evidence have shown the importance of CO2 challen ge as a panicogenic test, at this time, CO2 inhalation cannot be used as a diagnostic measure for PD (Freire and Nardi, 2012) . Researchers must determine whether CO2 challenge tests can help diagnose PD because symptoms of PD have diagnostic overlap with other rel ated psychiatric illnesses (e.g., social anxiety, generalized anxiety disorder, and specific phobia), unrelated medical conditions (e.g., asthma and myocardial infarction), and diagnostic specifiers for other 198psychiatric illnesses (e.g., social phobia with panic attacks) (Chen and Lin, 2011) . Investigations related to the CO2 challenge test in PD and other conditions may be able to better elucidate the mechanisms that distinguish PD from other pathologies, including disorders wher e panic attacks or panic -like symptoms are present. Furthermore, if panic reactions in people with PD and associated diseases are similar, a common, transdiagnostic component might be responsible for panic attacks caused by CO2 administration across diagno ses. In either case, it is critical to understand the function that this chemical agent may play in patients with PD, related pathologies, and healthy controls. Therefore, our main outcomes are as follows: (i) summarize the evidence on differences in CO2 respo nses in patients with mental illnesses vs. controls; and (ii) investigate whether CO2 responsiveness is similar across different diagnoses. METHODS Data sources We searched PubMed, PsycInfo, and Science Direct up to June 30th, 2021. The references cited in the systematically searched articles were manually checked. In an effort to avoid publication bias, the search also included non -English language studies and the gray literature (for example, conference abstracts). The searc h used a broadly structured strategy based on the Problem, Intervention, Comparator, Outcome, Setting (PICOS) framework (Huang et al., 2006) , where the population was mental health patients, the int ervention/exposure was the CO2 challenge test, the comparison was a control group, the outcome was anxiety response to CO2 challenge test, and any type of study design was allowed. Search terms included various combinations of terms related to CO2 and ment al disorders (Supplementary material). Two reviewers working independently considered the potential eligibility of each of the abstracts generated by the search strategy. Full -text articles were obtained unless both reviewers decided that an abstract was i neligible. Each full -text report was independently assessed for final study inclusion. Disagreements about the inclusion of full -text articles were resolved by consensus.", "Study selection Studies were selected for data extraction and analysis based on the f ollowing inclusion criteria: (1) original research studies in humans diagnosed with a psychiatric condition; (2) subjects met psychiatric diagnosis criteria based on a conventional psychiatric classification system, while control subjects did not meet crit eria for any mental health disorder; and (3) participants were subjected to the CO2 challenge test. The following exclusion criteria were used in the search: (1) participants had a comorbid or additional psychiatric diagnosis; (2) studies that lacked data for a healthy control group; (3) studies that compared one mental health condition with another; (4) human studies with prepubertal participants; (5) animal and in vitro studies; and (6) reviews, chapters, and meta -analysis.", "Data extraction and quality sco re 199The following variables were extracted from all the studies: authors, year of publication, subject characteristics in the affected and control groups, and characteristics of experiments involving CO2 challenge test. The current review was conducted according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines (Supplementary Material) (Moher et al., 2009) . The risk of bias of individual studies was independently assessed by two reviewers (LAQ and UM) using the Newcastle –Ottawa Scale (Wells et al., 1993) . Disagreements were resolved by consensus. All the authors agreed with the final inclusion of studies in the systematic review, data abstraction, and quality assessment. Details of the quality assessment are reported in the Supplemental Material.", "Statistical analyses Random effects pairwise meta-analyses, using the DerSimonian and Laird random effects model (DerSimonian and Laird, 2015), were conducted using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 26.0. Log odds ratios (ORs) with their 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were calculated to evaluate the association between the CO2 challenge test and psychiatric disorders. Statistical heterogeneity between eligible studies was evaluated by using Cochran’s Q statistic and I2 test. An I2 value below 50% indicated substantial homogeneity across studies. The study intended to assess publication bias using funnel plot techniques, Begg’s rank test, and Egger’s regression test, as appropriate, given the known limitations of these methods. RESULTS The use of PRISMA guidelines and a systematic search of electronic databases yielded a total of 450 studies. No additional studies were identified through manual searching of references. After elimination of duplicates, 247 titles were reviewed, of which 197 were excluded. In all, 50 full texts were reviewed, of which 28 met the inclusion criteria for our meta-analysis (Figure 1). Of the 28 studies included in the meta-analyses, 27 investigated the CO2 challenge test in individuals with PD (Woods, 1986, 1988; Griez et al., 1987; Ven Perna, 1995; Sasaki et al., 1996; Papp et al., 1997; Antony, 1997; Bocola et al., 1998; Goetz et al., 2001; Ponto et al., 2002; Gorman et al., 2004; Berzak et al., 2004; Rassovsky et al., 2006; Alkın et al., 2007; van Duinen et al., 2007; Niccolai et al., 2008; Monkul et al., 2010; Atlı et al., 2012; Woznica et al., 2015) , and 1 assessed this experiment in those with premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD ) (Harrison et al., 1989). Therefore, 1,333 subjects were investigated in the included research. The carbon dioxide concentrations and methods varied between studies (Table 1). The majority of the studies utilized carbon dioxide concentrations of either 5% or 35%. Canopy -based and continuous inhalation studies utilized lower carbon dioxide concentrations (i.e., 5%), whereas studies utilizing higher carbon dioxide concentrations (i.e., 35%) pre ferred 1 or 2 maximal breath (“vital capacity”) inhalations.", "A meta -analysis evaluated the effects of the carbon dioxide inhalation test in people with PD and PMDD, with healthy controls serving as the control group (Figure 2). The odds of 200carbon dioxide -induced panic attacks were significantly higher in PD (OR = 5.5; p <0.0001) and PMDD (OR = 9.1; p = 0.014) patients than in HCs. The selected publications were assessed for bias using the Newcastle –Ottawa Scale. In the studies included in the meta -analysis, there was no discernible indication of bias (Supplementary Material).", "DISCUSSION Our meta -analysis showed a considerably higher number of panic attacks in subjects with PD or PMDD in response to the breathing of CO2 than healthy controls. Although PMDD is not typically regarded as an anxiety disease, some PMDD diagnostic criteria, including heart palpitations and hot flushes, are comparable to panic attack symptoms, and increases in progesterone levels have been shown to enhance carbon dioxide sensitivi ty (Dutton et al., 1989) . Furthermore, the lifetime prevalence of PD in women is more than twice that of men (Eaton, William W. Kessler, 1994) , and women with PD commonly show menstrual cycle -linked fluctuations related to the symptoms of panic attacks (Dutton et al., 1989) . Moreover, an increase in anxiety symptoms and in the frequency of panic attacks has been reported to occur during the late luteal premenstrual phase (Nillni et al., 2011) perha ps related to the rapid fall of blood progesterone (Klein 1993). Progesterone may have anxiolytic properties, acting through both potentiation of the adenosine function (Phillis, 1986) and through barbiturate -like modulatory effects on the gamma -aminobutyr ic acid receptor complex ( Majewska et al., 1986 ). In addition, allopregnanolone and pregnanolone, two major metabolites of progesterone, are positive modulators of GABAergic function that enhance GABA -mediated inhibition (Covey et al., 2001) and produce anxiolytic, anesthetic, and anticonvulsant effects. However, to date, there have been inconsistent results regarding the levels of these metabolites in ind ividuals with PMDD and PD (Brambilla et al., 2003; Hantsoo and Epperson, 2020) . Progesterone and its metabolites might be the common denominator between PD and PMDD, and there is evidence that PMDD and PD patients might have GABAergic dysfunctions (Zwanzger and Rupprecht, 2005; Bixo et al., 2018) .", "Although only one study included in our meta -analysis did not involve subjects with PD, our findings imply that the carbon dioxide provocation test resulting in panic attacks is not exclusive to PD patients. Previous studies showed that the CO2 test failed to affected patients with obsessive -compulsive disorder or generalized anxiety disorder (Griez et al., 1990) but among patients with a specific phobia, the situational phobics presented a CO2 - induced reaction tending to resemble that of PD subjects ( Verburg et al. ,1994). CO2 sensitivity in humans may be considered along a spectrum, with PD patients being hypersensitive to low CO2 levels and healthy participants only exhibiting panic -like symptoms at higher levels (Nardi et al., 2006a, 2006b) . Extracellular pH is a key signal for homeostatic arousal control, with imp lications for behavior and respiration (Okuro et al., 2020) . When pH levels drop, chemoreceptors sensitive to CO2/H+ become active (Okuro et al., 2020) . Acid -sensitive channels, such as acid sensitive ion channels (ASICs), transient receptor potential (TRP) channels, vanilloid receptor 1 (TRPV1), and T -cell death-associated gene 8 (TDAG8), are among these chemoreceptors that have been 201linked to anxiety disorders (Quagliato et al., 2018) . When acidosis is detected, it causes ventilatory reactions, including hyperventilation and tachypnea (Quagliato et al., 2018) . Lower pH levels might be viewed as an interoceptive warning that triggers a panic attack in a particular situation (Okuro et al., 2020) . CO2 inhalation might contribute to cerebral acidosis, wh ich activates acid -sensitive circuits (such as ASIC channels) in the amygdala, causing anxiety and panic attacks (Okuro et al., 2020) . In brief, acidosis de tected by acid channels can cause autonomic, behavioral, and respiratory symptoms in panic attacks. It is still unclear what specific carbon dioxide concentration threshold is required to drive brain centers or when sensitivity to carbon dioxide arises. O ur findings indicated that 5% carbon dioxide inhalation was a sufficient threshold for the experimental carbon dioxide provocation test, and this level had equal efficacy in distinguishing between diagnoses as higher levels of carbon dioxide, such as 35%. If individuals with PD are more sensitive to carbon dioxide than healthy controls, investigations with carbon dioxide concentrations less than 5%, rather than high concentrations, should be performed to identify the crucial threshold to trigger a panic epi sode (Klein, 1993) . In general, low carbon dioxide concentrations might require minutes to cause panic episodes, while high concentrations might take seconds. U tilizing high amounts of carbon dioxide may decrease the impact of some confounding factors of the experiment, such as cognition and attention of the subject (Du et al., 2020) , because of the extremely brief provocative time of the intervention. Therefore, the comparison of the effectiveness of a single deep inhalation of 35% carbo n dioxide with continuous inhalation of low concentration (e.g ., 5%) carbon dioxide should be seen as two separate techniques employing high and low quantities of carbon dioxide with the same impact in inducing a panic attack.", "The fact that we did not divide our meta -analysis into subgroups comparing high and low CO2 concentrations is a limitation of our meta -analysis. The small number of studies performing experiments with low CO2 concentrations was one of the reasons for this limitation. Furthermore, we were unable to assess the impact of several mental disorders because the CO2 challenge was assessed in only PD and PMDD psychiatric patients compared to healthy controls. In addition, some demographic and clinical factors that have previously been linke d to the risk of panic attacks, for example, age and sex, were not considered in our meta -analysis since most papers that were included lacked data on age and sex distribution in patients with and without panic attacks following the carbon dioxide test.", "The CO2 challenge test might contribute to a transdiagnostic approach for psychiatric illness, since our findings imply that the carbon dioxide provocation test is not exclusive to PD patients. However, the number of studies examining the link between CO2 challenge and mental illnesses other than PD is relatively minimal, had small sample sizes and used a variety of methods. Thus, to make firm conclusions on the link between the CO2 challenge test and panic attacks in other psychiatric conditions, larger, mor e methodologically rigorous studies are needed. This could help us better understand the neurobiology of panic attacks and the physiopathology of anxiety disorders.", "202FIGURE", "Figure 1 - PRISMA flow diagram 203Figure 2 - The inhalation of carbon dioxide mixtures might cause greater anxiety responses in patients with panic disorder than in healthy controls. We performed a systematic review and meta -analysis to evaluate the evidence regarding differences in CO2 test response in patients with mental illnesses vs. controls and whether CO2 responsiveness is similar across different diagnoses. A meta -analysis demonstrated that the odds of carbon dioxide -induced panic attacks were significantly higher in patients with panic disord er and those with premenstrual dysphoric disorder than in healthy controls. Although premenstrual dysphoric disorder is not typically regarded as an anxiety disease, some premenstrual dysphoric disorder diagnostic criteria, including heart palpitations and hot flushes, are comparable to panic attack symptoms, and increases in progesterone levels have been shown to enhance carbon dioxide sensitivity. Furthermore, there is evidence that premenstrual dysphoric disorder and panic disorder patients might have GA BAergic dysfunctions, showing that CO2 challenge test might contribute to a transdiagnostic approach for psychiatric illness.", "204Study Study", "Subgroups CO2 (%) Diagnostic criteria Sample Size Alkin, 2007 PD vs. HC 35 DSM -IV 36 Antony, 1997 5.5 DSM –III–R 30 Berzak, 2004 35 DSM –III–R 31 Bocola, 1998 7 DSM –III–R 19 Fyer, 1987 35 DSM -III 13 Goetz, 2001 5 DSM –III–R 150 Gorman, 1994 7 DSM –III–R 44 Gorman, 1988 5 DSM -III 40 Gorman, 2004 5 DSM -IV 36 Griez, 1987 35 DSM -III 23 Monkul, 2010 35 DSM -IV 66 Niccolai, 2008 35 DSM -IV 22 Papp, 1997 7 DSM –III–R 89 Perna, 1994 35 DSM –III–R 115 Perna, 1995a 35 DSM –III–R 17 Perna, 1995 35 DSM –III–R 128 Perna, 1995b 35 DSM –III–R 86 Perna, 2004 35 DSM -IV 28 Ponto, 2002 35 DSM –III–R 26", "205Rassovsky,", "Sasaki, 1996 5 DSM –III–R 28 van Duinen, Woods, 1986 5 DSM -III 20 Woods, 1988 5 DSM -III 25 Woznica, 2015 35 DSM -IV-TR 45 van den Hout, Harrison, 1989 PMDD vs.", "HC 35 DSM –III–R 26", "206REFERENCES", "Alkın, T., Tural, Ü., Onur, E., Öztürk, V., Monkul, E.

Researchers and physicians must determine whether or not CO2 challenge test can help diagnose PD because symptoms of PD have diagnostic overlap with other related psychiatric illnesses (e.g., social anxiety, generalized anxiety disorder, and specific phobia), unrelated medical conditions (e.g., asthma and myocardial infarction), and diagnostic specifiers for other psychiatric illnesses (e.g. social fobia with panic attacks). Researchers may be able to understand the mechanisms th at distinguish PD from other pathologies, including pathologies where panic attacks or panic -like symptoms are present, if this panicogenic can distinguish PD from other pathologies, including pathologies where panic attacks or panic -like symptoms are present. Furthermore, if panic reactions in people with PD and associated diseases are similar, a common, transdiagnostic component might be responsible for panic attacks caused by CO2 administration across diagnoses. 21110.

These alterations do not respect diagnostic boundaries and are quite variable between persons with the same phenotypic diagnosis. Therefore, peripheral biomarkers could help underst and trans -diagnostic constructs of these psychiatry disorders. To provide ground for this hypothesis, first we identified most frequent peripherical biomarkers associated with mental disorders. Our search demonstrated that BDNF, CRP, IL -6, and TNF -alpha ar e among the most studied peripherical biomarkers across psychiatry diagnosis. Afterwards, we conducted an umbrella review - a systematic collection and evaluation of systematic reviews and meta -analyses done on a specific research topic - aimed at: (i) summa rizing the evidence on BDNF, CRP, IL -6, and TNF -alpha peripheral biomarkers in mental illnesses vs. controls; and (ii) investigating whether variation in the biomarkers levels occurs similarly across different diagnoses. This umbrella review shows that BDN F, IL- 6, TNF -alpha, and CRP are altered in the majority of psychiatry conditions compared to healthy controls. Specifically, BDNF levels are decreased in Bipolar Disorder, Major Depressive Disorder, and schizophrenia, and are increased in autism spectrum disorders. Inflammatory cytokines IL -6 and TNF -alpha, and CRP are increased in Post - Traumatic Stress Disorder, Bipolar, schizophrenia, and Major Depressive Disorder. The fact that variation patterns were consistent among illnesses indicates that mental disorders have biological commonalities in terms of peripheral characteristics that deserves further investigations.", "218 INTRODUCTION", "Although the search for the biological substrate of mental disorders is necessary for the development of more effective therapies and, above all, preventive strategies through early diagnosis, experimental attempts to identify specific markers for different disorders remain unsuccessful. Thus, current treatments are symptom -based, not disease m odifiers and have low response rates (Bosker et al., 2011) . Such negative results, at least in part, are related from a likely lack of specificity of global changes in brain biology for certain clinical conditions (Bosker et al., 2011) .In fact, the symptoms and clinical manifestations themselves are non -specific for the different disorders (Taporoski et al., 2015) . There is a lack of phenotypic specificity observed in the clinic. Hence, it is assumed that a common genetic basis may be linked to common abnormalities of brain structure and function in these disorders (Smoller et al., 2009) . These data compel the adoption of experimental strategies that consider both the differences and the biological similarities between the different diagnoses. The rationale for this strategy is that a genetic basis confers a common vulnerability to disturbances in brain maturation, plasticity and function (Smoller et al., 2009) . The interaction of this genetic base with non -genetic factors will determine pathoplasty and the varie ty of clinical manifestations (Smoller et al., 2009) . Currently, the detection and treatment of mental problems is restricted by historically established procedures that are based mostly on the subjective observation of the individual suffering from a mental condition (Hsin et al., 2018) . As a result, the psychiatric field has various criticisms regarding current mental diagnosis categories and the complete lack of a reliable biological signature modification to guide diagnosis (Hsin et al., 2018) . Indeed, one of the fundamental shortcomings of conventional, phenotypic -based psychiatry is its emphasis on a descriptive set of behaviors rather than objective markers to verify diagnosis (Hsin et al., 2018) . Peripheral biomarkers are now commonly acknowledged to be changed in a wide range of mental health problems (Yuan et al., 2019) . These alterations, from a phenomenological viewpoint, do not respect diagnostic boundaries and are quite variable between persons with the same phenotypic diagnosis (Yuan et al., 2019) . As a result, none of the peripheral biomarkers have been shown to be reliable in aiding in the differential diagnosis of mental disease s thus far (García -Gutiérrez et al., 2020; Yuan et al., 2019) .", "One critical piece of study that must be accomplished for the discipline of psychiatry to develop is the analysis of how markers in periphe ral blood behave at an individual level across diverse nosological categories (Angst and Merikangas, 1997) . Given the complexities of mental disorders, a single biomarker, or even numerous biomarkers related to the same unit of analysis within a biological system, i.e., a sing le domain, is unlikely to give adequate diagnostic criteria to guide real -world therapeutic decisions (García -Gutiérrez et al., 2020) . The investigation of many potential biomarkers in a wide range of illnesses, on the other hand, may contribute in the understanding o f microalterations in the neurocircuitry of psychiatric disorders (García - Gutiérrez et al., 2020) .", "219Based on aforementioned considerations, we hypothesize that peripheral biomarkers might underlie symptoms of mental illness and could help understand trans -diagnostic constructs of these disorders. To provide ground for this hypothesis, we conducted an umbrella review - a systematic collection and evaluation of systematic reviews and meta -analyses done on a specific research topic - aimed at: (i) understanding what are the most frequent peripherical biomarkers associated with mental disorders; (ii) summarizing the evidence on differences of these most frequent peripheral biomarkers in mental illnesses vs. controls; and (iii) investigating whether variation in the peripheral biomarkers levels occurs similarly across different diagnoses. METHODS Biomarker selection Primarily we aimed to identify the most frequent peripherical biomarkers associated with psychiatry disorders. Thus, we initially searched the PubMed database on June 5th, 2021 for articles containing the terms “biomarker” AND “serum” OR “blood” OR “plasma” AND several terms for psychiatric disorders (Supplementary Material). Although our search was not comprehensive, our goal was to deliberately choose papers on this issue for an automated keyword search, minimizing the amount of literature not related to the theme. Based on search results, we then ranked words in order of frequency to build a list of the molecules most frequently included as keywords for psychiatry disorders (Supplementary Material). We chose four most frequent molecules appearing among the top keywords for all psychiatry disorders − brain - derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF -alpha), interleukin -6 (IL-6), and C -reactive protein (CRP) for further study. Umbrella review: Search strategy and selection criteria We then conducted an umbrella review, in which, we systematically searched PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane databases from inception to October 02, 20 21. Full details of the search strategy, including search terms used, are included in the supplementary material . This search strategy was augmented through (1) handsearching the reference lists of included articles and (2) tracking citations of included a rticles through the Google Scholar database. Screening, data extraction, and methodological appraisal of included studies were done by at least two independent investigators (LAQ, UM, MLV) . Disagreements were resolved through consensus. We included meta -analyses published in peer -reviewed journals that assessed and synthesized studies on CRP, TNF -alpha, IL -6, and BDNF peripheral biomarkers for patients with a mental disorder. We included studies in which biomarkers were assayed in participants with a spec ific mental disorder compared to controls (i.e., between -group meta -analyses). We included studies in which diagnoses of mental disorders were conducted by means of a validated structured interview based on standard diagnostic criteria such as the Internat ional Classification of Disease (ICD) or the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) (Andrews et al., 1999; Dilling and Dittmann, 1990) We excluded the following types of studies: (1) within -group meta -analysis (2) systematic reviews without a meta -analytic synthesis of the evidence; (3) animal studies; (4) studies of other types of biomarkers (for example, 220 geneti c biomarkers); (5) studies that included participants with two or more diagnoses; (6) studies that investigated biomarkers for other purposes (for example, biomarkers of risk, stage or prognosis); (7) studies with older individuals; (8) less than 3 studies for each biomarker and (9) if there was more than one meta -analysis for the same biomarker in the same population, we considered only the largest meta -analysis (i.e., the one with the largest number of included individual studies). Data extraction and qu ality assessment For each eligible article, two investigators (LAQ and UM or MLV) independently extracted name of the first author; publication year; peripheral biomarker of interest; number of study population , as well as the number of included studies. We also extracted the summary effect size (ES) measure of each meta -analysis considering the ES used in each study.", "The methodological quality of included systematic reviews and meta -analyses was also appraised independently by two investigators using th e Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR) instrument (Shea et a l., 2007) . Scores range from 0 to 11 with higher scores indicating greater quality. The AMSTAR tool involves dichotomous scoring (i.e. 0 or 1) of 11 items related to assess methodological rigor of systematic reviews and meta -analyses (e.g., comprehensiv e search strategy, publication bias assessment). AMSTAR scores are graded as high (8 –11), medium (4 – 7) and low quality (0 –3)(Shea et al., 2007) .", "RESULTS 6.358 potentially eligible articles were identified by our initial search, 19 of which were eligible for inclusion (Figure 1). Statistically signi ﬁcant variations in the levels of BDNF, IL-6, TNF -alpha, CRP were found to occur in different psychiatry disorders. Interestingly, excluding neurodevelopmental disorders, the direction of variation was invariably the same across disorders for all markers (i.e. reductions in BDNF, and increases in inﬂammatory markers).", "BDNF level was assessed in 43.992 subjects. These investigations evaluated individuals with a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorders, Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), schizophrenia, and Bipolar Disorder (BD) (Bora, 2019; B S Fernandes et al., 2015; Brisa S. Fernandes et al., 2015; Molendijk et al., 2014; Munkholm et al., 2016; Polyakova et al., 2015; Qin et al., 2016; Rowland et al., 2018; Saghazadeh and Rezaei, 2017; Zheng et al., 2016) . BDNF levels were significantly decreased in BD(mania and depressive phases, but not euthymia), in MDD, and schizophrenia. However, individuals diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders, demonstrated a significantly higher BDNF levels compared to controls.", "Interleukin -6 was investigated in MDD, BD, schizophrenia, and post -traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (Goldsm ith et al., 2016; Haapakoski et al., 2015; Köhler et al., 2017; Modabbernia et al., 2013; Rowland et al., 2018; Valkanova et al., 2013) . This cytokine was evaluated in 19.180 individuals. In MDD, PTSD, and schizophrenia (first episode, acute psychotic d isorder or chronic psychotic disorder) IL -6 levels were increased. In 221 BD, IL -6 levels were increased in mania and euthymia, while they were not significant different than healthy controls in depressive bipolar episode. TNF-alpha was studied in 13.919 sub jects, and mental disorders such as MDD, BD, schizophrenia and PTSD were correlated with this interleukin (Goldsmith et al., 2016; Haapakoski et al., 2015; Köhler et al., 2017; Modabbernia et al., 2013; Munkholm et al., 2016; Passos et al., 2015; Rowland et al., 2018) . Individuals with a diagnosis of PTSD and schizophrenia presented elevated levels of TNF -alpha. MDD patients showed increased levels of TNF -alpha in acute episodes, while BD subjects demonstrated elevated levels of this interleukin in mania, and similar levels of this cytokines in euthymic individuals compared to healthy controls. CRP levels were assessed in 270.944 individuals (Bora, 2019; Dargél et al., 2015; B S Fernandes et al., 2016; Brisa S Fernandes et al., 2016; Haapakoski et al., 2015; Passos et al., 2015; Rowland et al., 2018; Valkanova et al., 2013) . This inflammatory marker was increased in schizophrenia, BD, and M DD, while in PTSD it was not different compared to controls.", "Although effect sizes were usually comparable across illnesses, evidence was stronger in some circumstances. Meta -analyses of BDNF and CRP for mood disorders produced more reliable differences than those of IL -6 and TNF -alpha, although differences in schizophrenia were strong for all molecules. Heterogeneity between studies was nearly always high, and evidence of publication bias was found in a considerable proportion of cases, despite the fact that adjusted effect estimates were rarely supplied.", "Qualitative methodological appraisal of eligible meta -analyses through the AMSTAR tool revealed that 15 references were classified as high, and 4 as medium methodological quality, respectively (Supplementary Material). The overall methodological quality of included references was high according to the AMSTAR [(median: 8; IQR = 2 (7 –9)] (Supplementary Material). DISCUSSION Our umbrella review found that the most commonly investigated peripheral biomarkers are generally the same across psychiatric disorde rs. This review shows that BDNF, IL - 6, TNF -alpha, and CRP are altered in the majority of psychiatry conditions compared to healthy controls. Specifically, BDNF levels are decreased in BD, MDD, and schizophrenia, and are increased in autism spectrum disorde rs. Inflammatory cytokines IL -6 and TNF -alpha, and CRP are increased in PTSD, BD, schizophrenia, and MDD. This is not surprising, given that similar compounds should elicit attention across disorders based on publishing trends. The fact that variation patt erns were consistent among illnesses, on the other hand, indicates that mental disorders have biological commonalities in terms of peripheral characteristics. Our review shows that peripheral inflammatory cytokines and CRP are elevated in schizophrenia, B D, and MDD comparing to controls. However, in PTSD individuals’ interleukins IL -6 and TNF -alpha are increase, but CRP levels were not different from controls. Considering that CRP, IL -6 and TNF -alpha are inflammatory mediators, our 222finding regarding PTSD p atients represent a paradox, since peripheral blood CRP is an acute phase reactant produced by the liver in response to innate immune cytokines notably IL -6 and TNF -alpha, and is also involved in the inflammatory response (Sproston and Ashworth, 2018) . This controversial result might be ex plained by the absence of standardize measurement of CRP in the current literature (Kimberly CRP and cytokines are large molecules that cannot readily cross the blood –brain barrier, but can enter the central nervous system and activate local inflammatory pathways via multiple routes: 1) passive transport into the brain at circumventricular regions where there is no blood -brain barrier; 2) binding to cerebral vascular endothelium, causing the production of secondary messengers such as prostaglandins and nitric oxide; and 3) carrier -mediated trafficking through the blood -brain barrier into the brain (Haroon et al., 2012; Hsuchou et al., 2012) . These mechanisms do not have to be mutually exclusive (Haroon et al., 2012) . They are influenced by the area of the inflammatory stimuli as well as the organism's illness condition (Haroon et al., 2012) . It is important to note, however, that most cytokines can be synthesized and released within the central nervous system by astrocytes and microglia, while CRP might be produced by neurons (Pawluk et al., 2020; Yasojima et al., 2000) . Once in the brain, these biomarkers of inflammation have been associated with various b rain activities, as neurogenesis, neurotransmission, long -term potentiation, and reduction of growth factors such as BDNF for instance (Becher et al., 2017) . One of the most studied neurotrophic factors in mental disorders is BDNF (Autry and Monteggia, 2012) . This work shows that peripherical BDNF levels were reduced in BD, MDD, and schizophrenia when compared to healthy controls. However, in autism evidence points towards an increase in BDNF levels. Given that BDNF crosses the blood –brain barrier, it is reasonable to assume that blood BDNF levels resemble those in the brain (Suliman et al., 2013) . This neurotrophin mediates survival and differentiation of neurons by binding and activating the tropomycin recep tor kinase B (TrkB) (Figure 2)(Zhang et al., 2016) . The binding of BDNF to TrkB leads to the subsequent activat ion of cytoplasmic signaling pathways including mitogen -activated protein kinase, phosphatidylinositol -3 kinase, and phospholipase C -γ(Zhang et al., 2016) . In addition to neurotrophic effects, BDNF –TrkB signaling has been implicated in several forms of neuroplasticity in different brain areas (Zhang et al., 2016) . In autism spectrum disorders the pathophysiological role of elevated BDNF is not well understood, but might represent an impaired function of this molecule in this condition (Bryn et al., 2015; Kasarpalkar et al., 2014) . Higher peripheral BDNF in autism is concordant with several neurological and psychological theories on the causes and symptoms of this disorder, and it contrasts notably with the lower levels of BDNF found in schizophrenia, BD, and MDD (Bryn et al., 2015) . However, altered BDNF expression and this neurotrophic factor impaired function may represent a s hared risk factor for the vulnerability of BD, MDD, schizophrenia , and autism by acting on biological mechanisms such as neuroplasticity, neurogenesis, and neurotransmission that are altered in all these psychiatric conditions (Bath et al., 2012; Grande et al., 2010; Jovanovic et al., 2000) .", "Our review provides evidence that the most frequent biomarkers associated with psychiatry disorders are related to inflammation and neurogenesis. Furthermore, variation in these peripheral biomarkers levels occurs similarly across different diagnoses. Nevertheless, this umbrella review has limitations. First, the use of peripheral 223 biomarkers has the constraint that some mediators, despite being exte nsively utilized in the scientific literature on the matter, may be affected by complicated and difficult to account for confounding variables (García -Gutiérrez et al., 2020) . Second, only MDD, BP, schizophrenia, autism, and PTSD data could be pooled for each listed d iagnostic category. As a result, future research should investigate trans -diagnostic issues that apply to various types of mental disease. Third, because research studying each diagnostic category utilized a separate severity scale, this review was unable to associate peripheral biomarkers with stages of mental illnesses. It is evident, however, how symptom categories overlap across multiple scales and classifications. Despite these limitations, our overall conclusion, that the most often researched periphe ral indicators in psychiatry are nonspecific markers of psychopathology across many illnesses, is likely valid. In this regard, it is essential to analyze how the literature might evolve in order to better assess its clinical value. It should also be highl ighted that the majority of the included meta -analytic estimations showed significant statistical heterogeneity. Although this is seen as a relevant evidence of bias in the research, it may also represent actual variability that can exist both within and b etween main diagnostic categories. Furthermore, methodological discrepancies between individual studies included in the evaluated meta -analyses may lead to heterogeneity. These include, for example, the timing of sample selection as well as assay measureme nt features (e.g. intra -assay and inter -assay coefficients of variation). Recently, guidelines for standardizing the collection and assessment of peripheral biomarkers in psychiatry were proposed (Gnanapavan et al., 2014) . Additionally, changes in sample selection between different studies might have contributed to the observed variability in certain meta -analytic estimations. For example, sickness stage and illnesses with heterogeneous presentations (e.g., PTSD or BD) may have led to heterogeneity in certain includ ed meta -analyses. Furthermore, initiatives to subtyping major mental diseases using frameworks such as the NIMH Research Domain Criteria may assist to reduce the heterogeneity of this literature in the future by studying physiologically valid and more homo geneous phenotypes (Cuthbert an d Insel, 2013) . Future research should define the term \"biomarker\" on a case -by-case basis, as there are several ways in which a molecule might act as a marker (García -Gutiérrez et al., 2020) . Although our study found a substantial number of exploratory cross -sectional studies that suggested potential biomarker uses, further prospective studies to test those ideas were uncommon (Kivimäki et al., 2013) . Such confirmatory studies, on the other hand, will almost certainly necessitate a more rigid design and greater statis tical power. In this regard, the development of reporting guidelines for biomarker studies, pre-registration of study protocols, and the formation of multicenter consortia are foreseeable ways to improve reproducibility (Gnanapavan et al., 2014; Kivimäki et al., A more specific constraint in the biomarker field that must be solved in order for multicenter consortia to thrive is the standardization of biomarker detection technologies, which were very variable in the sample included in this review. Although most res earch utilized ELISAs or comparable antibody arrays, specific methodological parameters such as assay sensitivity, usage of plasma or serum, anticoagulation, centrifugation process, and time of day for sample collection varied greatly between investigation s. Control levels in this umbrella review differed by many orders of magnitude among studies, most notably for BDNF, TNF -alpha, and IL -6, suggesting an 224urgent need for more homogenous processes to produce adequate reference values. There has been extensive discussion about how to standardize these procedures for clinical practice, as significant differences can be observed in published measurements, even with equivalent commercial kits (del Campo et al., 2015) . However, fewer research has attempted to define recommendations for biomarker identification in mental diseases, and this topic deserves further attention in the future. Despite the fact that the area of biomarker research will benefit from greater rigor and robustness, existing biomarker research can still be valuable. Changes in IL -6, TNF - alpha, CRP, and BDNF appear to be broadly repeatable across psychiatric diseases, implying that these biomarkers may reflect a common route in mental illness. Thus, research in the peripherical biomarker field may shed light on the links between psychiatric diseases, and give insights into pathophysiology, and disease development.", "225 REFERENCES", "Andrews, G., Slade, T., Peters, L., 1999.

Dessa forma, observar esse transtorno por meio de uma abordagem desenvolvimental é relevante e pode ajudar a identificar fatores modificáveis, objetivando , no futuro, a prevenção do transtorno. Essa ab ordagem desenvolvimental assume que há continuidade de alterações que ocorrem no processo de desenvolvimento do indivíduo que podem culminar no TP, ou seja, o efeito de experiências prévias é levado adiante ao longo do desenvolvimento , contribuindo para a abertura do quadro clínico .", "Esta tese demonstrou por meio de uma meta -análise da literatura pré -clínica que a ativação imune materna em roedoras gestantes promoveu ansiedade na prole. Evidências mostram que a ativação imune materna origina uma sensibilização das células microgliais, tor nando -as mais suscetíveis a novos fatores estress ores. Essa primeira sensibilização das células microgliais aumentaria a concentração do complexo inflamassoma NLRP3 e, ao acontecer um a segund a exposição a estímulos danosos do ambiente, a microglia faria a sua transição para uma morfologia ativada de maneira mais rápida e provocaria respostas inflamatórias exageradas, com uma produção exacerbada de citocinas inflamatórias e de marcadores de estresse oxidativo (CHEN et al., 2018) . Nos trabalhos apresentados nesta tese , verificamos que os pacientes com TP virgens de tratamento apresentam maiores níveis de citocinas inflamatórias e redução dos níveis de marcadores anti -inflamatórios. Ademais, esses pacientes demonstraram maiores níveis de thiobarbituric acid rea ctive substances (TBARS ), um marcador de estresse oxidativo, quando comparados com controles saudáveis. Pode -se supor que tanto a maior produção das citocinas inflamatórias quanto a de moléculas de estresse oxidativo podem advir de uma ativação microglial nesses pacientes.", "Além disso, es ta tese mostrou que subtipos específicos de maus -tratos durante a inf ância estão relacionados a diferentes vias de ativação de marcadores inflamatórios. Verificou -se que o abuso físico é um preditor para altas concentrações de IL -2R, enquanto que o abuso sexual prediz um aumento dos níveis de IL -1B em pacientes com TP. Os ma us-tratos durante a infância podem ativar as células 242 microgliais e contribuir para o desenvolvimento de psicopatologia. Essa ativação microglial causada pelo trauma infantil pode ser primária , ou seja , acontecer sem nenhuma ativação microglial inicial , ou secundária, quando houve uma sensibilização prévia da microglia, por exemplo, pela ativação imune materna durante a gestação. A capacidade de prever a trajetória das condições psiquiátricas é uma área crucial da pesquisa clínica. Há uma ênfase crescente em como a intervenção precoce para transtornos mentais pode reduzir a gravidade e a carga subsequente do s mesmos e, em alguns casos, pode retardar o desenvolvimento de transtorn os do limiar completo (CASPI et al. , 1996) . Dessa forma, avaliar os pródromos dos transtornos de ansiedade é útil para auxiliar no desenvolvimento de etapas de prevenção e elucidar os fatores de risco e proteção para esses transtornos. Considerando a íntima relação entre o sistema imune e o neurodenvolvimento, supomos que os filhos de pacientes com diagnóstico de TP (estágio 0) poderiam apresentar alterações nos seus níveis de citocinas inflama tórias periféricas, o que não foi confirmado por nosso estudo. Ademais, objetivando estudar os pr ódromos dos transtornos de ansiedade foi realizada uma revisão sistemática da literatura que evidenciou que a ansiedade materna durante o pré -natal está relaci onada a alterações na prole , tais como: comprometimento do desenvolvimento psicomotor e cognitivo na infância, além d os descendentes apresentarem maior tendência a expressar em emoções negativas, como medo ou tristeza, do que positivas e focarem a sua atenção majoritariamente em estímulos de medo . Já a ansiedade materna durante o período pós -natal está associada a maior tendência da prole expressar emoções negativas, bem como sintomas de internalização na infânci a e adolescência. Esse último estudo corrobora a ideia de que os mecanismos pelos quais a ansiedade no pré e pós -natal atuam na prole, apresenta m resultados diferentes conforme a idade da criança, o momento em que o indiv íduo está vivendo e o contexto familiar ou social em que ele(a) está inserido. Dessa forma, existiriam diversos desfechos possíveis diante de um mesmo processo do desenvolvimento dependendo dos fatores genéticos, estímulos ambientais e processos de resiliê ncia de cada individuo.", "A ideia de que existem diferentes desfechos para o mesmo processo de desenvolvimento é amparada pela teoria de que os transtornos mentais não seriam necessariamente categorias distintas, mas sim trajetórias desenvolvimentais 243 dimensionais (CUTHBERT; INSEL, 2013) . Como uma complexa malha rodoviária, em que diferentes rodovias podem levar ao mesmo local, diferentes trajetórias desenvolvimentais podem levar ao mesmo processo psicopatológico. Por outro lado, da mesma forma que as mesmas rodovias podem levar a os diferentes locais, as mesmas trajetórias psicopatológicas podem resultar em diferentes desfechos. Indivíduos que seguem uma determinada trajetória desenvo lvimental podem passar para outra, e quanto mais cedo o desvio é feito, maior será a dificuldade para retornar ao caminho original. Ou seja, uma abordagem que não respeita os limites das atuais classificações diagnósticas, poderia fornecer mais pistas acer ca do desenvolvimento dos transtornos mentais.", "Nesta tese há três manuscritos que tratam sobre os transtornos mentais de uma perspectiva transdiagnóstica. Em um desses trabalhos é evidenciado que alterações do sistema imune acontecem não apenas no TP , mas também no suicídio. Em outro , foi verificado que o teste de inalação de CO2, comumente associado ao TP, deve ser percebid o de um ponto de vista transdiagnóstico. Além disso, em uma revisão sis temática da literatura foi observado que os principais biomarcadores periféricos presentes nos transtornos psiquiátricos apresentavam padrões de variações semelhantes entre os mais diversos transtornos mentais . Isso indica que essas condições possuem semel hanças biológicas que se refletem por meio de biomarcadores periféricos que devem ser mais bem investigadas. Observar o TP por meio de uma perspectiva desenvolvimental pode ter implicações translacionais significativas especialmente se integrada ao modelo transdiagnóstico de transtornos mentais. Isso poderia catalisar uma compreensão orientada para o desenvolvimento das trajetórias do TP , que é essencial tanto para a previsão de risco personalizada quanto para a inovação d e tratamentos. E m particular, essa integração apoiaria uma melhor sistematização dos fatores de risco e manifestações endofenotípicas que caracterizam os estágios pré -mórbidos e prodrômicos iniciais (co incidindo com a infância e pré -adolescência) d as trajetórias de neurodesenvolvimento alteradas que poderiam levar ao TP . A fim de se confirmar essa perspectiva , estudos longitudinais, particularmente as investigações que acompanham os indivíduos desde os momentos iniciais do seu desenvolvimento até a vida adulta , serão um caminho promisso r para a melhor compreensão do TP de um ponto de vista desenvolvimental.", "244Para que seja possível traduzir o conhecimento gerado por meio das pesquisas em benefícios para a população, precisamos entender os mecanismos através dos quais fatores associados levam ao desenvolvimento do TP. Embora isso possa representar um desafio, estamos confiantes de que tal esforço valerá a pena em todos os aspectos a fim de que, futuramente, possamos promover intervenções precoces visando a redução d a cronificação do transtorno, além de permitir terapêuticas personalizadas que irão melhorar a vida de muitos pacientes."]}

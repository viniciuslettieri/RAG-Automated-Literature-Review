Using crystal violet staining and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), it was observed that EVs were able to inhibit biofilm formation in vitro. By means of SEM and brightfield microsco py, we demonstrated that the addition of EVs in a yeast culture of C. albicans in a filamentation -inducing medium, these were capable of interrupting the filamentation process of the fungus. The ability of EVs from C. albicans to regulate the morphological transition in the fungus was compared using EVs isolated from different strains of C. albicans , with EVs from Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Histoplasma capsulatum . EVs from C. albicans from different ATCC strains (10231 and SC5314) also showed an ability t o inhibit filamentation, while EVs from S. cerevisiae and H. capsulatum showed a drastically reduced ability to inhibit morphogenesis. EVs from C. albicans yeasts were also able to reverse filamentation in C. albicans hyphae in an inducing medium when they were incubated for 8 hours at 37 °C. Our data suggest that the inhibitory activity of C. albicans EVs in the phase transition must be largely promoted by a combination of lipid compounds, which were identified by GC/MS as being a heterogeneous group of se squiterpenes, diterpenes and fatty acids. We also observed that C. albicans yeasts pre -treated with EVs for 24 hours lose their ability to penetrate the agar, suggesting a reduction in their invasive capacity. Furthermore, the pre -treated yeasts were shown to be avirulent when injected into Galleria mellonella larvae. This set of results allows us to infer that EVs from C. albicans can regulate yeast to hyphal differentiation, thus inhibiting biofilm formation and attenuating the virulence of the tested str ains under these experimental conditions.", "Keywords: Candida albicans , extracellular vesicles, fatty acids, morphogenesis inhibition, biofilm, farnesol", "x LISTA DE FIGURAS", "xi LISTA DE TABELAS", "xii LISTA DE SIGLAS E ABREVIATURAS", "ALS do inglês agglutinin -like sequence APC do inglês Antigen Presenting Cells ATCC do inglês American Type Culture Colection Brg1 do inglês biofilm regulator 1 CLRs Receptores de Lectina de tipo C DAPI 4′,6-diamidino -2-phenylindole – marcador nuclear DMSO Dimetilsulfóxido DC Célula Dendrítica Ece1 do inglês Extent of cell elongation protein 1 Efg1 do inglês enhanced filamentous growth protein 1 ESCRT Complexos de Classificação Endossômica Necessários para a Maquinaria de Transporte FOH Farnesol GUT do inglês gastrointestinally induced transition GPI glicosilfosfatidilinositol HIV Vírus da Imunodeficiência Humana Hwp1 do inglês hyphal wall protein 1 Ig# Imunoglobulina # IL-# Interleucina # IP3 Inositol -trifosfato MAPK Proteína Quinase Ativada por Mitógeno MHC Complexo de Histocompatibilidade Princip al MQS Moléculas de Quorum Sense MVB Corpos Multivesiculares PAMPs Padrões moleculares associados a patógenos PBS Salina Tamponada com Fosfato PKA Proteína Quinase A PIP2 Fosfatidilinositol -bifosfato xiii RNA Ácido ribonucleico RPMI Meio do Instituto Ro swell Park Memorial Sap do inglês secreted aspartyl proteinases Th# Células T Auxiliares do Tipo # TLR# Receptores Semelhantes à Toll # TNF Fator de Necrose Tumoral VEs Vesículas Extracelulares", "xiv SUMÁRIO", "1 INTRODUÇÃO", "1.1 Candida albicans", "Com estimativas que vão em média de 3 milhões a 12 milhões de espécies (HAWKSWORTH; LÜCKING, 2017) , os fungos contam com mais de 120.000 espécies identificadas (WU et al., 2019). Presentes em todos os habitat s do planeta, os fungo s têm como característica principal a sua parede celular constituída principalmente por polissacarídeos (BROWN; DENNING; LEVITZ, 2012). Com grande impacto nos ecossistemas, os fungos mantêm relações simbiontes e mutualísticas com outras espécies podendo a dquirir nutrientes com estruturas especializadas, também podem captar nutrientes através de tecidos mortos, necrófilos , ou pelo dano de tecidos do hospedeiro, saprófitos (KÖHLER et al., 2017). Embora haja um número grande de fungos na biosfera, apenas uma diminuta parte destes pode acometer aos humanos (BROWN et al., 2012), sendo capazes de ge rar danos que vão desde infecções superficiais, reações alérgicas, micoses invasivas, geralmente letais (BONGOMIN et al., 2017). Dentre os fungos capazes de promover doença sistêmica, destacam -se os gêneros Aspergillus, Histoplasma, Candida e Cryptococcus , responsáveis por invasão tecidual, disseminação por órgãos como: pulmões , rins, fígado e sistema nervoso central (LOCKHART; GUARNER, 2019).", "O gênero Candida conta com cerca de 200 espécies descritas, contudo apenas 15 espécies são causadoras de infecções em humanos, com destaque para as espécies: Candida albicans, Candida parapsilosis, Candida tropicalis , Candida glabrata e Candida krusei , que respondem pela maior parte das infecções (MCCARTY; WH ITE; PAPPAS, 2021). Alguns do s membros do gênero Candida são conhecidos por serem comensais humanos, e sendo assim conseguem adaptar -se ao hospedeiros, o que explica o desenvolvimento de estratégia s de escape das defes as do hospedeiro e seu oportunismo em situações de desequilíbrio homeostático (MCCARTY; PAPPAS, 2016). De todas as espécies presentes no gênero, C. albicans é considerad a a mais proeminente, sendo o agente etiológico com maior prevalência em casos de candi díases, tendo grande impacto na saúde pública (MCCARTY; WHITE; PAPPAS, 2021; NOBLE; GIANETTI; WITCHLEY, 2017).", "C. albicans trata-se de um micro -organismo constituinte normal da microbiota anfibiôntica humana de um amplo número de indivíduos da população, podendo ser encontrado no trato gastrointestinal, na cavidade oral, pele e microbiota vaginal (D’ENFERT et al., 2021; NEVILLE; D’ENFERT; BOUGNOUX, 2015). A ext ensão da relação desenvolvida entre C. albicans e o hospedeiro humano é evidenciad a por estudos epidemiológicos, onde C. albicans tem grande número de incidência e prevalência e uma vasta distribuição global (PFALLER et al., 2019).", "Estima -se que ocorram cerca de 250 mil casos de candidíase no mundo, com mais de 50 mil mortes por ano, s endo estimado que de 45 a 70% dos casos o agente etiológico é C. albicans (PFALLER et al., 2019), (Tabela 1).", "Distribuição de Isolados de Candida de 1997 -2016 Anos Números de Isolados Porcentagem por espécie C. albicans C. glabrata C. parapsilosis C. tropicalis C. krusei Adaptado de Pfaller et al., 2019", "Além de C. albicans estar presente na microbiota de muitos indivíduos, algumas características apresentadas por essa espécie favorecem o desenvolvimento de infecções. Podendo ser citado, principalmente, sua capacidade de adaptar -se as mais diversas condições ambientais e nic hos d o hospedeiro, em decorrência de sua plasticidade genética, que reflete em plasticidade metabólica e morfológica (NOBLE; GIANETTI; WITCHLEY, 2017). Em sua biologia, C. albicans é um fungo polimórfico que pode assumir diversas formas morfológicas , sendo as formas de levedura e a forma filamentosa, também chamada de hifa as mais estudadas (KADOSH; MUNDODI, 2020). Além destas duas formas, destaca -se a forma conhecida como pseudo -hifa (CHEN et al., 2020). Outras formas assumidas por C. albicans são a forma opaca, clamidósporo e GUT, do inglês, gastrointestinally induced transition (Figura 1) (DADAR et al., 2018). Além de sua plasticidade, outros fatores de virulência têm grande relevância no desenvolvimento da infecção.", "(d) Hifas, (e) Clamidospóro e (f) Células GUT (Pande et al. , 2013).", "1.2 Fatores de Virulência", "A capacidade de C. albicans de modificar sua forma celular e/ou liberar compostos para o meio extracelular em resposta às mudanças nas condições ambientais como: pH, temperatura, condições osmóticas e a resposta imune do hospedeiro são pré -requisitos para coloniza ção com sucesso no sítio anatômico (STANISZEWSKA, 2020). Durante essa adaptação C. albicans conta com uma ampla variedade de fatores de virulência que tornam este fungo apto a passar de um estado comensal para um estado invasivo patogênico , características de micro -organismo s oportunistas . Um fator de virulência essencial e que está associado a alterações significativas na ultraestrutura, no fenótipo e na composição da parede celular desse fungo é a capacidade deste micro -organismo de alterar reversivelmente sua morfologia de levedura para a forma filamentosa, denominado de dimorfismo (STANISZEWSKA, 2020; TALAPKO et al., 2021). Além do dimorfismo, outros fatores de virulência já foram descritos e serão discutidos abaixo, como a expressão de adesinas e invasinas na superfície c elular que permitem que C. albicans possa se associar e danificar células hospedeiras; a formação de biofilmes; e a elevada capacidade de secretar moléculas e enzimas hidrolíticas (DE BARROS et al., 2020; MCCARTY; PAPPAS, 2016).", "1.2.1 Morfogênese", "A transição morfológica é considerada um dos principais fatores de virulência em C. albicans (GOW et al., 2012). Tal importância foi inicialmente demonstrada em mutantes que não fazem a transição levedura -hifa, essas cepas apresenta vam uma letalidade atenu ada em um modelo murino (LO et al., 1997). Contudo, ambas as formas, levedura e hifa, têm grande importância na patogenicidade, uma vez que as hifas são responsávei s pela invasão e dano inicial ao hospedeiro, enquanto as leveduras tem sido associadas a dis seminação (JACOBSEN et al., 2012). Diversos estímulos ambientais podem ser os responsáveis por induzir a morfogênese em C. albicans (NOBLE; GIANETTI; WITCHLEY, 2017). Um exemplo que ilustra a relação dessa espécie com o ser humano é a incubação em soro e a uma temperatura de 37 °C, es ses são estímulos potentes para a transição levedura -hifa (WITCHLEY et al., 2019). Outros estímulos descritos como promo tores de diferenciação morfog ênica são também : pH 7 ou alcalino, privação de uma fonte de carbono ou nitrog ênio, moléculas de quorum sense , a concentração de CO 2, e a presença de N -Acetilglucosamina (GlcNAc) (SUDBERY, 2011). Esses estímulos , que podem s er oriundos do hospedeiro ou de membros da microbiota ou em decorrência da interação com eles , induzem resposta s por vias de sinalização distintas e estas controlam a morfogênese a nível molecular em C. albicans (KIM; SUDBERY, 2011). Através de estudos in vitro e com o uso de cepas de C. albicans onde genes específicos foram deletados , numerosos sinais foram descritos , bem como as vias que controlam a transição da levedura (a/α), forma mais comumente encontrada, para hifa, bem como os controladores da transição da levedura de forma branca (a ou α) para a form a opaca (a ou α), esta transição é fundam ental para evento de reprodução sexuada (NOBLE; GIANETTI; WITCHLEY, 2017) (Figura 2) .", "do hospedeiro levam a regulação da morfogênese em C. albicans . A via da proteína quinase A (PKA) é ativada, dependente ou não de sinais oriundos da proteína GTPase Ras 1, culmina na síntese de AMP cíclico a partir de ATP pela adenilil ciclase (Cyr1). Este cAMP medeia a ativação das duas subunidades catalíticas (Tpk1 e Tpk2) do complexo PKA (CHEN et al., 2002; SI et al., 2013). Uma vez ativado, o complexo PKA fosforila o fator de transcrição conhecido como proteína de crescimento filamentoso 1, do inglês enhanced filamentous growth protein 1 (Efg1), provocando a filam entação e na troca da forma branca (a ou α) para opaca (a ou α) (STOLDT et al., 1997). A sinalização da via da PKA é inibida por moléculas quorum sensing como, o sesquiterpeno farnesol. A via da MAPK, proteína quinase ativada por mitógeno (Cek1) inicia uma cascata de sinalização em resposta ao crescimento a danos na parede celular, estresse osmótico e a privação de nitrogênio, levando a fosforilação do fator de transcrição (Cph1) para também induzir a filamentação (LU; SU; LIU, 2012; MAGEE et al., 2002).Em células de C. albicans opacas (a ou α), o feromônio sinaliza também através da cascata da MAPK, mas leva à fosforilação adicional da MAPK (Cek2) e a ativação de genes de acasalamento. A via da MAPK (Hog1) é acionada por estresses osmóticos e oxidativos atr avés da proteína (Sln1) ou da proteína adaptadora (Sho1) o que leva à fosforilação da Hog1. Quando Hog1 é ativada, esta inibe a filamentação impedindo a ação da Cek1, assim como do regulador do biofilme Brg1, do inglês, biofilm regulator 1 (BRAUN; KADOSH; JOHNSON, 2001; BROWN JR et al., 1999; HUANG et al., 2006; LU et al., 2013).A via da proteína Rim101 é desencadeada pela detecção de pH alcalino através de dois receptores (Dfg16 e Rim21) que iniciam a cascata de sinalização proteolítica que resulta na cliv agem carboxi -terminal do fator de transcrição Rim101 pela protease Rim13 e a ativação de genes específicos através de Efg1 levando a filamentação (DAVIS; WILSON; MITCHELL, 2000). Já a via Ofd1 e a via Tor1 respondem a baixos níveis oxigênio e a privação de nutrientes, respectivamente, regulando a filamentação através dos fatores de transcrição Brg1 e Ume6 (BANERJEE et al., 2008; LU; SU; LIU, 2012). Adaptado por (Noble et al. , 2017).", "1.2.2 Adesão e Invasão", "A capacidade de adesão às células hospedeiras é considerada essencial para o início do processo infeccioso. D iversos fungos possuem uma gam a de glicoproteínas presentes na superfície da parede celular que são responsáveis por essa interação, essas estrutur as são conhecidas como adesinas ( COTA; HOYER, Entre as adesinas expressas por C. albicans descritas na literatura , as proteínas da família de sequências do tipo aglutinina (ALS, agglutinin -like sequence ) são as mais estudadas (HILLER et al., 2011; KARKOWSKA -KULETA; RAPALA - KOZIK; KOZIK, 2009). A família ALS conta com oitos membros (ALS1 a ALS7 e ALS9). As ALS possuem três regiões distintas em sua sequência, (i) a porção N - terminal, a qual se liga ao substrato e está relacionada a função adesiva (WILLAERT, 2018), (ii) a porção central que consiste em repetições de aminoácidos ricos em serina e treonina, e (iii) a porção C -terminal, também rica em serina e treonina. Essa última é altamente glicosilada, contendo um remanescente de âncora de glicosilfosfatidilinositol (GPI) que promove sua ligação covalente com a parede celular (LIU; FILLER, 2011; ZHU; FILLER, 2010). A adesina Als3 participa no processo de adesão e invasão celular ativamente, a Als3 se liga a E -caderinas de células endoteliais e células epiteliais orais, com esta interação ocorre a indução da endocitose do fungo por parte da célula do hospedeiro (PHAN et al., 2007) (Figura 3).", "incluem a adesão ao epitélio do hospedeiro; penetração e invasão por hifas; disseminação vascular, que envolve a penetração de hifas ao vaso sanguíneo, com destaque para principais adesinas, Hwp1, Als3 e Ssa1 envolvidas na invasão tecidual, e o peptídeo C andidalisina, responsável pela formação de poros na membrana celular. (G OW et al. , 2011; M ITCHELL , 2016) A adesina Als3 também está envolvida na aquisição de ferro do hospedeiro . Esta adesina pode se ligar a ferritina no interior de células epiteliais. Mut antes em Als3 falharam na associação com a ferritina, essa incapacidade de conexão leva a uma redução do crescimento , isto quando a ferritina foi utilizada como fonte de ferro , e estas cepas se mostraram incapazes de danificar as células do hospedeiro (ALM EIDA et al., 2008). Outra adesina descrita é codificada pelo gene INT1 . A deleção desse gene inibe o mecanismo de diferenciação levedura -hifa e reduz a habilidade do fungo de aderir ao epitélio (HOSTETTER, 2008).", "Adicionalmente, a proteína Hwp1 ( hyphal w all protein 1 ), presente no tubo germinativo e hifas de C. albicans , parece participar diretamente na adesão e invasão de células epiteliais (NOBILE et al., 2006; PONNIAH et al., 2007). Além disso, a proteína Hwp1 pode se ligar às adesinas Als 1 e Als 3, esta junção é responsável pela adesão hifa -hifa, associação considerada vital para a formação do biofilme (NOBILE et al., 2008). Além da Hwp1, a proteína Eap1 também estar ancorada à parede celular através de um remanescente de GPI, estudos indicam ser es sencial para o processo de adesão (NOBILE; MITCHELL, 2006). Entretanto, o mecanismo exato que envolve a participação de Eap1 ainda não foi elucidado (FILLER, 2006; LIU; FILLER, 2011). Estudos comparativos sugerem que os domínios N -terminais que interagem c om o substrato no processo de adesão são similares entre essas proteínas. Da mesma forma, a parte da âncora GPI que é necessária para incorporação destas proteínas na parede celular, também apresentam homologia quando comparados com outras adesinas (MODRZE WSKA; KURNATOWSKI, 2015).", "1.2.3 Biofilme", "A formação de aglomerados de micro -organismos em comunidades aderidos a uma superfície, denominado biofilme, também se destaca como um atributo associado à virulência em C. albicans . Os biofilmes podem estar aderi dos a uma superfície ou encontradas na interface entre ar -líquido, cercados por uma matriz extracelular polimérica . Esses biofilmes podem ser formados exclusivamente por C. albicans ou misto, associado com outros fungos ou bactérias (ALIM; SIRCAIK; PANWAR, 2018; GULATI; NOBILE, 2016).", "Uma característica notável dos biofilmes é sua resistência a danos químicos e físicos, assim como sua instalação em ambientes distintos, incluindo ambientes bióticos (tecidos vegetais e animais) como t ambém em abióticos (cateteres, dispositivos prostéticos e outros materiais) (ÍÑIGO; DEL POZO, 2018; RODRÍGUEZ - CERDEIRA et al., 2019). Estudos recentes apontam biofilmes formados por micro - organismos patogênicos como responsáveis, direta ou indiretamente, p or 80% das infecções (NOBILE; JOHNSON, 2015). C. albicans forma biofilmes altamente estruturados que contam com os três tipos celulares mais bem estudados: leveduras, pseudo -hifas e hifas (GULATI; NOBILE, 2016), conforme observado na (Figura 4 ). Os biofilmes acarretam inúmeros benefícios para as células ou comunidade ali presente, como: uma maior facilidade na captação de nutrientes; maior proteção contra raios UV e estresses oxidativos; resistência a fagocitose; resistência a antimicrobianos e desidrataçã o (CHANDRA et al., 2001; MUKHERJEE et al., 2005 ; BLANKENSHIP et", "e in vivo (b), proveniente de cateteres introduzidos em camundongos na região do tórax, pescoço e espaço interescapular por microscopia eletrônica de varredura (MEV) (F INKEL e MITCHELL , 2011)", "O processo de formação do biofilme geralmente é dividido em quatro estágios distintos (Figura 5), que são: (i) a adesão de células de levedura mediada pela parede celular do fungo ao substrato; (ii) a proliferação dessas células em uma camada fina, compost a principalmente por carboidratos, incluindo β−1,3-glucanas, e glicoproteínas, (iii) maturação do biofilme, onde mecanismos de sinalização celular levam a uma alteração da expressão gênica associada a uma transição morfológica das células leveduriformes para pseudo -hifas e hifas com a secreção / acúmulo de matriz extracelular, e finalmente (iv), na última etapa, ocorre à dispersão do biofilme. Nessa etapa as células não aderidas são liberadas para o ambiente, podendo iniciar um novo ciclo de formação do biofilme, possivelmente com a finalidade de ocupar nichos diferentes dentro do hospedeiro (FINKEL; MITCHELL, 2011; GULATI; NOBILE, 2016; LOHSE et al., 2018).", "estágios principais: adesão das leveduras a uma superfície; iniciação da formação de biofilme, durante esse processo, as células se aderem à superfície e formam uma camada basal composta por leveduras, pseudohif as e hifas (também conhecida como estágio de proliferação); maturação em um complexo biofilme estruturado, onde as células são envoltas por uma matriz extracelular; e a dispersão de leveduras para que colonizem outro espaço. (b) Microscopia Eletrônica de V arredura de um estágio de maturação do biofilme de C. albicans , com hifas bem visíveis. O marcador utilizado concanavalina A - Alexa Fluor 594 não penetra nas camadas mais internas do biofilme, consequentemente, as leveduras aderidas à superfície não pudera m ser visualizadas. A matriz extracelular também não é visualizada, pois não adere ao marcador (adaptado de (Lohse et al. , 2018).", "O processo de geração do biofilme é de grande impacto para sobrevivência e manutenção da infecção no hospedeiro (BUJDÁKOVÁ, 2 016). Tanto a resistência, quanto a tolerância e a capacidade do micro -organismo de manter -se viável na presença do fármaco em concentrações de inibição de crescimento são fenômenos multifatoriais que geralmente estão associados à formação de biofilme (MAT HÉ; VAN DIJCK, 2013; NOBILE; MITCHELL, 2006). O mecanismo de resistência pode estar associado à densidade e arquitetura do biofilme, sua morfologia, moléculas de quorum sensing , resposta ao estresse, e formação de matriz extracelular persistente, trazendo limitação na penetração de substâncias através da matriz (MATHÉ; VAN DIJCK, 2013; NOBILE; MITCHELL, 2006). Um dos fatores chave que atuam na aderência das células e, resultando no sucesso na formação do biofilme é a natureza e característica do substrato (WALL et al., 2019).", "As superfícies mais hidrofóbicas suportam uma colonização mais rápida quando comparadas às superfícies hidrofílicas (LOHSE et al., 2018). A hidrodinâmica do local onde o biofilme está em desenvolvimento também pode interferir no processo de adesão celular, na disponibilidade de nutriente e na dispersão do micro -organismo (LIU; TAY, 2002). Ademais, a composição do meio também afeta a formação de biofilme, leva ndo a transição da morfologia de C. albicans . Fatores como temperatura e pH atuam diretamente sobre as enzimas, permitindo condições para sua atuação catalítica máxima. Além disso, íons livres presentes no biofilme podem afetar a interação das células com o substrato favorecendo ou não sua ligação. Essas interações são de grande relevância no processo de formação e desenvolvimento do biofilme (DE BARROS et al., 2020). O biofilme também conta com modificações nas células presentes na comunidade microbiana, o nde várias proteases secretadas são super expressas nas células do biofilme quando comparadas com células planctônicas, promovendo perfis de clivagens proteolíticas distintos para cada tipo celular (WINTER et al., 2016). A expressão gênica das células prese ntes no biofilme é diferenciada em cada estágio e forma de crescimento nessa comunidade. Por exemplo, as leveduras dispersas do biofilme são mais virulentas, apresentando uma maior capacidade de adesão do que leveduras planctônicas (WALL et al., 2019). Com o mencionado acima, as modificações induzidas no fungo alteram tanto a quantidade, quanto presença ou ausência de moléculas secretadas, como moléculas de quorum sensing, importantes para a diferenciação celular, e secreção de estruturas que auxiliam tanto na aderência.", "1.2.4 Secreção", "Alguma s moléculas secretadas por C. albicans também se destacam como fatores de virulência durante o desenvolvimento da infecção, destacando -se a produção e secreção de enzimas hidrolíticas, como proteases, lipases e fosfolipases (RĄPAŁA -KOZIK et al., 2018). Apesar de terem papel na nutrição do fungo , estas também participam do dano tecidual, aquisição de ferro, escape imune e disseminação. Um grupo de enzimas hidrolíticas secretada pela C. albicans que tem sua atividade bem documentada e merecem destaque durante a adesão e no processo infeccioso, são as aspartil proteases secretadas (SAPs – do inglês secreted aspartyl proteinases ), que, em C. albicans , conta com ao menos 10 diferentes genes (SAP1~SAP10) (DE BERNARDIS; SULLIVAN; CASSONE, 2001). Esses genes codificam enzimas com funções e características similares, mas com propriedades moleculares diferentes, como por exemplo, sua massa e pH para atividade ótima (SILVA; NERY; DIAS, 2014).", "As SAPs possuem regulação e expressão dependente da fase morfológica em que a célula fúngica é encontrada (NAGLIK et al., 2004). A expressão das SAPs tem relação direta e está associada a diversos atributos da virulência, que incluem a transição morfológica levedura -hifa e a adesão. Nas leveduras de C. albicans as principais SAPs expressas são as SAPs 1, 2 e 3, estas enzimas encontram -se transitoriamente na superfície e são secretadas, estas estão ligadas ao dano tecidual ao hospedeiro (NAGLIK; CHALLACOMBE; HUBE, 2003). Na forma filamentosa são encontradas, principalmente, as SAPs 4, 5 e 6, relac ionadas com infecções sistêmicas (NAGLIK et al., 2004). As SAPs 9 e 10 são encontradas em ambas as formas, e estão conectadas à parede celular através de remanescentes de âncoras GPI (HUBE; NAGLIK, 2001). As SAPs 7 e 8 carecem de mais estudos, mas com indicativos que a SAP 7 é encontrada em algumas amostras clínicas de infecções orais em humanos e a SAP 8 aparece em níveis mais altos durante infecções vaginais Outro fato que aponta para a importância das SAPs é que células derivadas de biofilme secretam mais SAPs do que leveduras planctônicas, sugerindo que desempenham um papel importante na formação e manutenção do biofilme de C. albicans (SATALA et al., 2021). A atividade hidrolíticas das SAPs tem um papel relevante no desenvolvimento da candidíase . Em u m estudo com o reposicionamento do Lopinavir, um inibidor de protease de HIV, SANTOS e colaboradores (2021) demostraram que este composto era capaz de inibir a S AP de C. albicans, o uso do Lopinavir teve a capacidade de controlar a infecção disseminada em modelo murino, tanto de imunocompetência quanto de imunocompromet imento (SANTOS et al ., 2021). Estes dados mostram como as SAPs tem relevância no processo infeccioso. Existem também indicativos que esta e nzima é capaz de degradar hemoglobina, albumina, queratina e a imunoglobulina A (IgA), sendo assim facilitadora no processo de destruição das barreiras anatômicas e facilitando a penetração no tecido ou na corrente sanguínea (HUBE, 1998; SCHALLER et al., 2 005a).", "Além das SAPs e das fosfolipases, C. albicans também secretam serin a- proteases e nove lipases. As peptidases degradam proteínas do soro humano e componentes da matriz extracelular (DOS SANTOS et al., 2006). Já as lipases, hidrolisam ligações éster d e mono -, di- e triacilglicerol (SCHALLER et al., 2005b). Em C. albicans são encontradas também as fosfolipases, que constituem 4 famílias: fosfolipases A, B, C e D (PLA, PLB, PLC e PLD), lis ofosfolipases e transacilases, são enzimas responsáveis por metabolizar os fosfolipídios presentes no hospedeiro durante o processo infeccioso (NIEWERTH; KORTING, 2001). A atividade dessas enzimas está associada a múltiplos efeitos. Por exemplo, a fosfolipase A catalisa a reação do fosfolip ídio a lisolecitina, um componente tóxico de muitos venenos de cobra e abelha. Por outro lado, essa enzima tem a capacidade de destruir membranas das hemácias. A fosfolipase A é representada pelas duas isoenzimas fosfolipase A1 e fosfolipase A2, que difere m em quais ácidos graxos elas retiram. A fosfolipase A1 remove o ácido graxo externo da molécula de glicerol no fosfolipídio , enquanto a fosfolipase A2 remove o ácido graxo intermediário (NIEWERTH; KORTING, 2001). A fosfolipase B consegue remover ambos os ácidos graxos. Os produtos da reação são a glicerilfosforilcolina e dois ácidos graxos livres (DOS SANTOS et al., 2006). A fosfolipase C cliva a ligação carbono -fosfato da fosfatidilcolina, promovendo a liberação da fosforilcolina e o diacilglicerídeo. Alé m disso, a fosfolipase C desempenha um papel importante na transdução de sinal. As catecolaminas (adrenalina, noradrenalina), assim como outros hormônios e neurotransmissores, como a vasopressina, angiotensina, serotonina e acetilcolina, são capazes de ati var a fosfolipase C. A fosfolipase C ativada cliva o fosfatidilinositol - bifosfato (PIP2) em moléculas de inositol -trifosfato (IP3) e diacilglicerídeo (NIEWERTH; KORTING, 2001). A fosfolipase D remove a colina da fosfatidilcolina para produzir ácido fosfatí dico. Em testes com isolados clínicos de candidíase cutânea com cepas de C. albicans e não -albicans , Souza Ramos e colaboradores 2015, conduziu uma comparação entre esses grupos , onde foi mostrado que em 58 isolados clínicos (15,5% versus 82,5%), que a pro dução proteases, em especial SAPs foi de (100% versus 53,1%) e de fosfolipase (100% versus 4,1%) mostrando que a fosfolipase é relevante para C. albicans durante o processo infeccioso ( de SOUZA RAMOS et al, 2015).", "A lisofosfolipase metaboliza a lisolecitin a tóxica produzida pela ação da fosfolipase A1 e A2. Remove o segundo ácido graxo para produzir a glicerilfosforilcolina e a lisofosfolipasetransacilase catalisa a transacilação entre duas moléculas de lisolecitina. Fazendo uma lipólise e uma etapa de tran sacilação, em que duas moléculas de lisolecitina são transformadas em glicerilfosforilcolina e fosfatidilcolina (NIEWERTH; KORTING, 2001).", "1.2.5 Peptídeos", "As toxinas peptídicas são fatores de virulência bem caracterizados em vários patógenos bacterianos , estes peptídeos podem romper barreira epitelial , danificar as células e ativar ou modulam as respostas imunes do hospedeiro (NAGLIK; GAFFEN; Recentemente, um fator de virulência descrito em C. albicans foi caracterizado . Tal toxina não havia sido identificadas anteriormente em fungos patogênicos humanos (MOYES et al., 2016). Esse fator de virulência é codificado pelo gene ECE1 , a proteína traduzida é processada para dar origem a um peptídeo bioativo. Tal peptídeo, denominado de candidalisina, é capaz de intercalar -se na membrana de células epiteliais, desestabilizando a membrana e leva r a um influxo de cálcio e extravasamento celular. Embora presente nas duas principais formas, a candidalisina é secretada em maiores concentrações pela hifa de C. albicans , principalmente durante o processo de invasão tecidual (MOYES et al., 2016). Candidalisina é crítica para infecções sistêmicas e mucosas de C. albicans (MOYES et al., 2010), este peptídeo também é capaz de ativa a resposta imune do hospedeiro e promover o recrutamento de neutrófilos e direcionar o perfil Th17 (VERMA et al., 2017).", "1.2.6 Moléculas de quo rum sensing (MQS)", "A comunicação é um processo essencial para a manutenção da vida , ela também tem uma grande participação no ordenamento de comportamentos de uma população. Mesmo em populações de micro -organismos unicelulares, a comunicação celular via pequenas moléculas secretadas facilitam um comportamento determinado – um efeito denominado dete cção de quorum (FALÀ et al., 2022). Estas moléculas também pode m controlar o dimorfismo em C. albicans , um mecanismo de comunicação microbiana compartilhado com outras espécies (MALLICK; BENNETT, 2013; PADDER; PRASAD; SHAH, 2018). O Farnesol (FOH), ácido f arnesóico e tirosol são as principais MQS relacionadas à morfogênese produzidas por C. albicans (RODRIGUES; ČERNÁKOVÁ, 2020), embora outros derivados de aminoácidos também tenham sido caracterizados com atividade similar (KRUPPA, 2009). O FOH e o ácido far nesóico impedem a diferenciação de levedura para hifa sem afetar as taxas de crescimento (RIEKHOF; NICKERSON, 2017). O tirosol estimula o tubo germinativo e a formação de hifas, essas MQSs também são capazes de regular a formação de biofilme (RODRIGUES; ČE RNÁKOVÁ, 2020).", "O FOH foi a primeira MQS identificada em eucariotos, este é produzido como um produto secundário da via sintética do esterol pela desfosforilação do farnesol pirofosfato (FPP) em C. albicans (NICKERSON; ATKIN; HORNBY, 2006). Estima -se que cerca de 1,6% de todo o FPP da via de síntese de esteróis seja direcionado para a produção de FOH (NICKERSON; ATKIN; HORNBY, 2006). Quando comparada com outras espécies do gênero Candida , C. albicans produz quantidades elevada de FOH, podendo atingir conce ntrações de até 50 μM em culturas (WEBER et al., 2008; WEBER; SCHULZ; RUHNKE, 2010). Todavia, a produção de FOH pode variar substancialmente entre cepas (JUNG et al., 2016). Em bora os efeitos inibitórios de FOH na filamentação de C. albicans sugiram que ele poderia funcionar na redu ção da virulência, os dados de Navarathna e colaboradores (2007 ) indicam que, pelo menos durante infecções sistêmicas, o FOH promove a progressão da doença quando adicionado de forma exó gena. Quando as células de C. albic ans são injetadas junto com o FOH ocorre um aumento da mortalidade e da carga fúngica nos rins em um modelo murino de candidíase sistêmica, indicando a participação FOH no processo infeccioso (NAVARATHNA et al., 2007). Outro dado que sugere a partic ipação do FOH em mecanismos de resistência do fungo é o tratamento de C. albicans com concen trações subinibitórias de azóis. O contato prévio com os compostos leva a um aumento considerável na produção de FO H, e este aumento acarreta em uma maior virulência destas células fúngicas em um modelo murino de candidíase sistêmica (NAVARATHNA et al., 2005). Embora o FOH seja uma molécula de relevância na fisiologia de C. albicans , nem todas as cepas são capazes de produzir esse sequiterpeno. A cepa selva gem de C. albicans ATCC10231 , por exemplo, não sintetiza FOH , mas apenas ácido farnesóico, que é cerca de dez vezes menos ativo na sua ativida de inibitória da filamentação (JUNG et al., 2016 ).", "Outro grupo de moléculas com atividade na diferenciação de C. albicans são os ácidos graxos. Essa s biomolécula s são caracterizada s pela presença de um grupo carboxila ( -COOH) em uma extremidade e um grupo metila ( -CH3) na outra extremidade podem conter entre 4 a 36 átomos de carbono. Os ácidos graxos pertencem a uma classe fisiologicamente importante de moléculas envolvidas no armaze namento de energia celular, bicamada fosfolipídica da estrutura da membrana e em várias vias de sinalização (LIU et al., 2008). Os ácidos graxos variam em comprimento e grau de saturação, com ácidos graxos de ocorrência natural tendo um comprimento de cade ia de 4 a 28 carbonos, podendo ser saturados ou insaturados (SADO -KAMDEM; VANNINI; GUERZONI, 2009). A composição química dos ácidos graxos, bem como o pH do meio, desempenham um papel importante na capacidade desses compostos de interagir com o fungo, com destaque para o ácido decanóico, dodecanóico e tetradodecanóico (BERGSSON et al., 2001; KABARA et al., 1972) . A capacidade dos ácidos graxos livres de inibir a filamentação de C. albicans e a formação de biofilme também foi relatada (LEE et al., 2021; NOVE RR; HUFFNAGLE, Muitos destes fatores de virulências são exportados para o ambiente extracelular, onde os processos secretórios são críticos para o escape das defesas do hospedeiro, como também para a patogênese de C. albicans .", "1.3 Vesículas extracelulares", "As v esículas extracelulares (VEs) são compartimentos formados por uma bicamada lipídica e a sua produção já foi relacionada com todos os tipos celulares investigados até momento (JOFFE et al., 2016). O isolamento e caracterização das VEs fúngicas ocorreu primeiramente no ano de 2007 no fungo C. neoformans (RODRIGUES et al., 2007). A secreção de VEs foi descrita em muitas espécies fúngicas como: Histoplasma capsulatum, Saccharomy ces cerevisiae, Sporotrix shenckii e S. brasiliensis, C. albicans, C. glabrata, C. parapsilosis, C. tropicalis, C. auris, Paracoccidioides brasiliensis, Malasezzia sympodialis, Aspergillus fumigatus (ALBUQUERQUE et al., 2008; VALLEJO et al., 2012; VARGAS e t al., 2015; IKEDA et al., 2018; SOUZA et al., 2019; ZAMITH -MIRANDA et al., 2022 ; KULIG et al., 2022 ). Existem diferentes propostas sobre os mecanismos de biogên ese relacionados com as vesículas extracelulares fúngicas. C ontudo tanto os mecan ismo que regul am a saída, e a seleção do cargo dessas estruturas ainda não está completamente esclarecida (DE OLIVEIRA et al., 2020). Três principais processos já foram relacionados com a produção de VEs por fungos: (i) derivação a partir de corpos multivesiculares, dando origem aos exos somos, (ii) através do brotamento a partir da membrana plasmática e denominados genericamente de microvesículas e (iii) originando -se a partir de subtração citoplasmática (DEATHERAGE; COOKSON, 2012; RODRIGUES et al., 2013; WOLF et al., 20 14) (Figura 6). Devido à diversidade observada nesses compartimentos, há uma forte sugestão que a origem e saída das VEs provavelmente ocorram de maneira s distinta s (RODRIGUES et al., 2008). As VEs normalmente são divididas de acordo com seu tamanho . A nomenclatura destes compartimentos, apesar de estar em desuso, normalmente é: exossomos, com um tamanho indo de 2 0 a 130 nm de diâmetro e são liberados a partir da fusão dos corpos multivesiculares (MVBs); e em microvesículas , com um tamanho entre 200 a 1000 nm. A formação dos MVBs ocorre a partir de invaginações nos compartimentos endossomais em um mecanismo dependente do complexo de proteínas ESCRT (endosomal sorting complex required for transport ) (KALLURI; LEBLEU, 2020; VAN NIEL; D’ANGELO; RAPOSO, 201 8). Atualmente, seguindo os critérios definidos pela Sociedade Internacional de Vesículas Extracelulares as VEs são classificadas principalmente de acordo com seu tamanho em: VEs pequenas ( até 200 nm ), médias e grandes ( de 200 a 1000 nm) (THÉRY et al., 201 8).", "aprese ntam três diferentes origens: (a) exossomos originados a partir de corpos multivesiculares (MVBs) que se fundem com a membrana plasmática, (b) brotamento de VEs partir de invagin ações da membrana plasmática, (c) micropinocitose invertida. Adaptado de (N IMRICHTER et al., 2018).", "A importância da liberação desses compartimentos na biologia fúngica foi investigada com o uso de mutantes em diferentes proteínas que participam de processos de secreção. Em C. neoformans e C. gattii foi demonstrada a importância de Snf7 para sua virulênc ia, uma vez que a deleção deste gene resultou em alterações na produção de fatores de virulência do fungo, tais como: na formação da cápsula e na pigmentação (GODINHO et al., 2014). Em C. albicans os dados obtidos com cepas com deleção de componentes da ma quinaria ESCRT levou a redução de VEs de biofilme (ZARNOWSKI et al., 2018). A redução dos níveis de polissacarídeos e a maior sensibilidade ao fluconazol vistas nessas cepas mutantes foram revertidos com a adição de VEs da cepa selvagem, apontando para a f unção das VEs no biofilme (ZARNOWSKI et al., 2018).", "Um dos pontos ainda pouco esclarecidos sobre a liberação das vesículas fúngicas para o meio extracelular é o mecanismo utilizado pelas VEs para atravessar a parede celular. Até o momento, três hipóteses foram sugeridas: (i) através de canais na parede celular; (ii) induzindo um remodelamento da parede por enzimas presentes nas vesículas, facilitando a passagem destas e (iii) através da pressão mecânica, força ndo a passagem das VEs pelos poros presentes na parede celular (RODRIGUES et al., 2015).", "Conforme sugerido pela variabilidade de mecanismos de biogênese, as VEs possuem uma composição complexa e heterogênea. Em conjunto, os estudos quem vem caracterizando a composição desses compartimentos revelam a presença de lipídeos, proteínas, polissacarídeos, pigmentos , metabólitos secundários e material nuclear ( RODRIGUES et al., 2008; VALLEJO et al., 2012; GIL -BONA et al., 2015; VARGAS et al., 2015; JOFFE et al., 2 016; GIL -BONA et al., 2018 ; REIS et al., 2021 ). Vale ressaltar que embora muitas das estruturas descritas sejam encontradas de forma conservada entre as espécies fúngicas, outras são espécies específicas (JOFFE et al., 2016; VALLEJO et al., 2012).", "O primeiro estudo demonstrando uma atividade biológica de VEs fúngicas foi publicado pelo nosso grupo em 2010. Neste trabalho foi visto que macrófagos murino estimulados com VEs de C. neoformans acarretava na produção de óxido nítrico (NO) e das citocinas TNF-α, IL-10 e TGF -β além de promover um aumento da atividade antifún gica dessas células (OLIVEIRA et al., 2010). Observou -se que VEs produzidas pela cepa mutante CAP67 (acapsular) de C. neoformans , livres de glucuronoxilomanana (GXM), estimulam uma ativid ade inflamatória maior em macrófagos quando comparadas com as VEs da cepa selvagem, que carreia GXM. A GXM é considerada o principal fator de virulência deste fungo e está relacionada com uma potente modulação negativa das células do sistema imunitário (UR AI et al., 2015). Esses dados sugerem, portanto, que a composição das VEs fúngicas pode ser crucial na regulação da atividade de células hospedeiras (OLIVEIRA et al., 2010). Resultados semelhantes também foram observados quanto a atividade biológica de VE s produzidas por C. albicans em células fagocíticas murina . As VEs produzidas por C. albicans estimularam a geração de NO e a produção das citocinas IL-12p40, TNF -α IL-10 e TGF -β por macrófagos. As VEs de C. albicans também promoveram o aumento da expressão de moléculas MHC de classe II e da molécula co-estimulatória CD86 em células dendríticas, i ndicando a possível indução desses compartimentos na resposta imune adaptativa (VARGAS et al., 2015). Além disso, trabalhos apontam para a capacidade de polarização e re -polarização de macrófagos murino para o padrão M1, perfil inflamatório, após incubação com VEs de Paracoccidioides brasiliensis (DA SILVA et al., 2016).", "Resultados adicionais sugerem que não há fusão desses c ompartimentos com a membrana plasmática de fagócitos (OLIVEIRA et al., 2010; VARGAS et al., 2015). Além disso, as VEs de C. albicans e C. neoformans são internalizadas com potencial participação de domínios lipídicos, sugerido pela co -localização com o gangliosídeo GM1 (OLIVEIRA et al., 2010; VARGAS et al., 2015). Este conjunto de dados apontam para a possibilidade de uma internalização e ativação celu lar mediados por receptores na superfície da célula hospedeira.", "Outro ponto relevante é que a lguns fatores de virulência estão entre os componentes carreados pelas VEs, e sua presença levantou questionamentos sobre o papel das VEs no processo de patogênese , com a possibilidade de que esses compartimentos sejam capazes de interferir no desenvolvimento da doença. Ikeda e colaboradores (2018) demonstraram que VEs de S. brasiliensis são também capazes de promover a ativação de DCs (IKEDA et al., 2018). Contudo, a administração das VEs previamente e durante o curso da infecção em um modelo murino de esporotricose acarretaram no aumento das lesões, uma maior carga fúngica no tecido cutâneo e em cortes histológicos. Foi também observado o incremento de citocinas pr ó-inflamatória nos tecidos infectados (IKEDA et al., 2018). Esses resultados sugerem que as VEs podem impactar em todo processo infeccioso de formas distintas, dependendo do momento em que elas entram em contato com o hospedeiro. Resultados similares foram observados por Huang e colaboradores (HUANG et al., 2012) explorando um modelo murino de criptococose. Nesses experimentos a administração de VEs fúngicas em conjunto com o fungo promoveu um aumento na permeabilidade em células endoteliais permitindo um a umento significativo na chegada de leveduras no cérebro (HUANG et al., 2012). Uma combinação de estudos desenvolvidos pelo grupo do Dr. Robin May confirma o envolvimento de VEs fúngicas na comunicação celular e vem sugerindo uma atividade de maior complexi dade desempenhada pelas VEs de C. gattii . Voelz e colaboradores (VOELZ et al., 2014) descreveram um fenômeno denominado de “divisão de trabalho” dur ante a interação de macrófagos com leveduras de C. gattii . A hipótese sugere que uma população de C. gattii se manteria quiescente no interior do macrófago, porém resistente ao ambiente oxidativo intracelular, enquanto outra população menos resistente se proliferaria de forma mais intensa favorecendo o desenvolvimento da infecção. A participação das VEs durante esse processo foi sugerida posteriormente por Bielska e colaboradores. De acordo com esses autores, a internalização de VEs produzidas por uma cepa virulenta de C. gattii foi capaz de promover um aumento da sobrevivência de leveduras avirulentas dessa mes ma espécie fúngica presentes no interior desses macrófagos. Dessa forma, esses autores sugerem que as VEs fúngicas podem ser responsáveis pelo envio de sinais associados com a virulência (BIELSKA et al., 2018).", "Além de impactar na virulência e no sistema imune do hospedeiro, a composição das VEs participa na comunicação entre organismos fúngicos (BITENCOURT et al., 2022), participa no aumento do crescimento de C. albicans (WEI et al., 2023) e com a sugestão de tr ansferência de resistência entre cepas (CHAN et al., 2022 ). As VEs também têm um papel crítico durante a produção da matriz polissacarí dica do biofilme e resistência do mesmo a drogas em C. albicans", "2 JUSTIFICATIVA", "A importância das VEs no processo patogênico dos fungos podem acarretar no aumento conhecimento sobre a biol ogia celular d estes, e levar a descoberta de possíveis novos alvos para o desenvolvimento de novas terapias alternativas. Com os avanços na compreensão da resposta imunológica das infecções fúngicas obtido nos últimos 15 anos o uso de vacinas para controlar essas infecções vem sendo estimulada.", "Dura nte o desenvolvimento da minha dissertação de m estrado investigamos o efeito das VEs de C. albicans como formulações vacinais . Demonstramos que após a interação das células murinas diferenciadas com GM -CSF (TLR4 -/-, TLR2 -/-, CLEC7a -/-) com VEs de C. albicans levavam a uma redução acentuada na resposta de citocinas, em especial na IL -6 nas células deficientes de TLR4. Além disso, vimos com o uso de VEs de cepas de C. albicans mutantes em N -manana e N - e O-manana a redução da secreção d e IL-6 no mutante de N -manana e aumentada no mutante N - e O-manana no animal TLR4 -/-. Este dado nos indicou que alterações no padrão de manosilação na superfície das VEs influenciam na resposta do hospedeiro. E por fim, vimos em um modelo de vacinação com animais TLR4 -/- que estes animais não sobreviviam a um desafio letal com o fungo, d iferentemente dos animais selvagens. Mostrando que esse receptor tem um papel central na resposta as VEs de C. albicans em nosso modelo (manuscrito em preparação).", "Nossos resultados nos levaram a uma busca bibliográfica aprofundada sobre as estratégias e alternativas vacinais para o controle de infecções fúngicas. Conforme sugerido por (OLIVEIRA et al., 2021). Nesse contexto, a VEs apresentam diferentes proteínas, polissacarídeos e lipídeos em sua constituição fisiológica o que seria uma forma mais efetiva na geração de uma resposta imunológica e mais eficiente, uma vez que estas poderiam funcionar como seus próprios adjuvantes (PIFFER et al., 2021) . Além disso, um dos maiores fatores limitantes no desenvolvimento de vacinas terapêuticas para infecções fúngicas se encontra na baixa imunogenicidade de antígenos purificados, quando administrados isoladamente e os gastos referentes às etapas de purificação desses componentes. Diante disso, os compartimentos vesiculares secretados por fungos poderiam não apenas apresentar uma comb inação de moléculas antigênicas e estimuladoras do sistema imune, mas também reduzir os custos de maneira substancial nessas etapas. Outro ponto positivo é que a confirmação desse efeito abre um novo caminho para o uso de ferramentas moleculares podendo as sim inserir ou remover componentes dessas VEs para a geração de vacinas sem organismos vivos. Por essa razão consideramos relevante a preparação de uma revisão que discutisse os achados relacionados a atividade imunobiológica de VEs produzidas por fungos.", "Desde a primeira descrição de vesículas extracelulares (VEs) fúngicas p or Rodrigues et al. em 2007 (RODRIGUES et al., 2007) , uma sér ie de estudos vem mostrando que os fungos são capazes de utilizar esses compartimentos como um mecanismo de exportação de um vasto número de moléculas (PIFFER et al., 2021) . Os fungos podem produzir populações heterogêneas de VEs que contem lipídios, proteínas, polissacarídeos, pigmentos , metabólitos secundários e ácidos nucléicos , e estas podem atravessam a parede celular, atingindo o meio extracelular e liberando essas moléculas (RODRIGUES et al., 2007; EISENMAN et al., 2009; VALLEJO et al., 2012; VARGAS et al., 2015; RAYNER et al., 2017) . O conteúdo v esicular pode variar bastante dependendo da espécie estudada, bem como as condições de cultivo do fungo (PIFFER et al., 2021 ). Enzimas, toxinas, moléculas de sinalização e antígenos reconhecidos pelo sistema imune inato e adaptativo foram descritos como mo léculas presentes em vesículas extracelulares de micro -organismos, sendo portanto capazes de influenciar diretamente na fisiologia microbiana e na patogênese (DEATHERAGE; COOKSON, 2012) . Sua implicação durante a resposta imunológica e durante os processos patológicos vem sendo investigada por vários grupos (HUANG et al., 2012; BIELSK A et al., 2018; IKEDA et al., 2018; COSTA et al., 2021) .", "Por outro lado, pouco ainda se sabe sobre os efeitos das VEs nas próprias células fúngicas. As VEs apresentam uma composição bastante complexa. Estes compartimentos carreiam uma diversidade de biomoléculas. Dentro dessa diversidade de compostos, várias moléculas participam de processo de comunicação .", "Recentemente, Bi elska e colaboradores mostraram que VEs isolada s de uma cepa virulenta de Cryptococcus gattii são internalizadas por macrófagos pre viamente infectados com uma cepa não virulenta da mesma espécie fúngica levando a um aumento da virulência desta cepa, aumentando seu crescimento intracelular (BIELSKA et al., 2018) . A presença de RNA e proteínas estáveis nas VEs era necessária para esse evento (BIELSKA et al., 2018) . As V Es também têm um pap el crítico durante a produção da matriz polissacarídica do biofilme e resistência do mesmo a drogas em C. albicans (ZARNOWSKI et al., 2018, 2021, 2022) . Entretanto apesar do crescente número de estudos com VEs fúngicas, há poucos estudo mostrando o papel das VEs na biologia do próprio fungo.", "3 OBJETIVOS", "3.1 Objetivos Gerais", "Investigar o papel das vesículas extracelulares produzidas por leveduras de C. albicans e seus co mponentes durante o processo d e morfogênese , na formação do biofilme fúngico , e na letalidade da candidíase.", "3.2 Objetivos Específicos", "1 – Investigar a participa ção das VEs de C. albicans durante a formação de biofilme e na filamentação de C. albicans .

Em organismos fúngicos, as VEs atravessam a parede celular e atingem o ambiente extracelular, onde podem interagir com as células hospedeiras e potencialmente impactar a atividade de células hospedeiras e no desfecho da doença. Análises de composição demonstraram que VEs de fungos carregam lipídios, proteínas, polissacarídeos, ácidos nucléicos , pigmentos e uma diversidade de pequenos metabólitos. Dentre essa diversidade de compostos, várias moléculas com propriedades imunogênicas foram caracterizadas. Corroborando a capacidade das VEs fúngicas em estimular células do sistema imune inat o, com o estímulo da produção de anticorpos e com a proteção de insetos e camundongos contra infecções fúngicas , discutimos as vantagens do uso dess es compartimentos como uma nova plataforma para o desenvolvimento de vacinas antifúngicas.", "Neste capítulo é abordado um panorama geral sobre o enfretamento das infecções fúngicas, e o quão negligenciado é o problema; uma descrição breve de como o sistema i mune do hospedeiro mamífero e em modelos de invertebrados reage a colonização de fungos; o desenvolvimento de vacinas antifúngicas e suas limitações em alguns grupos de pacientes; as propriedades e aspectos gerais descritos na literatura das VEs fúngicas; e como as VEs fúngicas são uma plataforma promissora para novas formulações de vacinas.", "Com base nos avanços sobre a compreensão da resposta imune durante o desenvolvimento das infecções fúngicas , evidências crescentes indicam que a imunizaç ão é uma estratégia promissora para prevenir essas enfermidades .

A plasticidade, adaptabilidade e grande diversidade dos fungo s, junto ao fato d e que a principal população acometidos por esses patógenos são os pacientes imuno comprometidos são os principais desafios a serem enfrentados. Uma vacina ideal requer uma ativação das respostas imunes inata e adaptativa , onde os efeitos colaterais sejam baixos e a resposta robusta . Com base em estudos que abordam a composição e a atividade biológica, o uso das VEs fúngicas aparece como uma estratégia em potencial. As VEs carregam antígenos distintos em sua estrutura nativ a, e muito desses antígenos são aqueles que tem sido frequentemente testados em formulaç ões para vacinas antifúngicas. Além disso, VEs possuem tamanhos nanométricos e carreiam, tanto na superfície quanto no cargo, polissacarídeos que podem contribuir diretamente para o reconhecimento da célula hospedeira e no processamento de antígenos. Poucos e studos testaram sua eficácia , mas os resultados tem sido promissores. A utilização das VEs em formulações antifúngicas se mostra uma alternativa promissora, mas ainda há um longo caminho a ser percorrido para o uso real desta alternativa .", "Fungal Extracellular Vesicles as a Potential Strategy for Vaccine Development Leandro Honorato, Jhon Jhamilton Artunduaga Bonilla, Alicia C. Piffer, and Leonardo Nimrichter Contents Abstract Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are released by virtually all live cells. In fungal organisms, the EVs traverse the cell wall and reach the extracellular environ- ment, where they can interact with host cells and potentially impact the disease outcome. Compositional analyses have demonstrated that fungal EVs carry lipids, proteins, polysaccharides, glycans, nucleic acids, and a diversity of small metabo- lites. Among this variety of compounds, several molecules with immunogenic properties were characterized. It corroborates with their ability to stimulate innate immune cells, induce antibody production and protect insects and mice against fungal infections. In this chapter, we discuss the advantages of using fungal EVs as a new platform for the development of antifungal vaccines.", "L. Honorato · J. J. A. Bonilla · A. C. Piffer · L.

Rodrigues, G. Janbon (eds.), Fungal Extracellular Vesicles , Current Topics in", "1 Introduction: Fungal Infections: A Worldwide Neglected", "Problem Although clearly overlooked by the public health authorities, fungal infections have a substantial impact on human health (Havlickova et al. 2008 ; Rodrigues and Nosanchuk 2020 ; Bongomin et al. 2017 ). The metabolic diversity, sometimes associated with the ability to interconvert between different morphological stages,makes fungal organisms easily adaptable to different environments (Cole 1996 ). Since some species also express virulence factors and have the capacity to grow atthe human body temperature, they can cause a plethora of infections that vary fromathlete ’s foot to invasive disseminated and highly lethal diseases (Köhler et al. 2017 ; Hogan et al. 1996 ). Classic primary fungal pathogens, such as Histoplasma capsulatum ,Paracoccidioides sp,Blastomyces dermatitidis ,Cryptococcus gattii , Coccidioidis sp, and Sporothrix sp, among others, can cause infection by evading or subverting the immune system (Köhler et al. 2017 ; Hogan et al. 1996 ). However, the disease establishment is facilitated in immunosuppressed patients (Köhler et al.2017 ; Antachopoulos et al. 2007 ; Walsh and Groll 1999 ). Immunosuppression can be congenital, caused by infections (such as HIV/AIDS) or comorbidities, and hasbeen closely associated with medical advances, including modern immunosuppres- sive and invasive interventions. Once the immune system is compromised, oppor- tunistic fungal species can also adapt to humans and cause disease, especiallyCandida sp,C. neoformans ,Aspergillus sp, and Pneumocystis jirovecii. Together, this group of organisms is responsible for about 90% of the deaths caused byinvasive fungal infections (Brown et al. 2012 ). Notably, the risk of developing a fungal infection is not restricted to speci ﬁc areas where some pathogens are endemic. For instance, C. albicans can be a commensal colonizer in nearly 50% of individuals (Kullberg and Arendrup 2015 ). However, under episodes of dysbiosis or immuno- suppression, this species can overgrow and cause diseases, mostly infecting the mucosa of the oral and genital tracts. Cases of disseminated candidiasis are fre-quently reported in immunosuppressed patients, with mortality levels estimated to beup to 40% (Kullberg and Arendrup 2015 ). The global situation can aggravate with the emergence of new and less common, but medically important fungal species.Recent studies reported patients diagnosed with mucormycosis in association withCOVID-19 (John et al. 2021 ; Revannavar et al. 2021 ). In addition, outbreaks of candidiasis caused by C. auris have been reported in hospitals from all continents.", "C. auris was described for the ﬁrst time in Japan about 10 years ago and is intrinsically resistant to most of the existing antifungal drugs (Du et al. 2020 ).", "Sporothrix brasiliensis is another emerging species currently responsible for an outbreak of feline and human sporothricosis in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil (Gremiãoet al. 2017 ). There are four major classes of drugs typically used to combat human fungal infections, which include azoles, polyenes, echinocandins, and pyrimidines (Walland Lopez-Ribot 2020 ). However, despite the availability of ef ﬁcient antifungal drugs, it is estimated that fungal diseases affect more than a billion people, killing122 L. Honorato et al.43 more than 1.5 million every year (Bongomin et al. 2017 ). These numbers can signiﬁcantly enhance in a near future, with the evolution of drug resistance (Fisher et al. 2018 ). In addition, these drugs have side effects and interactions that frequently cause treatment interruption. Antifungal regimens can take months, are expensive and some drugs are not available worldwide (Bongomin et al. 2017 ). Thus, new strategies to combat fungal infections are urging. Innovative drugs, exploiting noveltargets at fungal cells, have been proposed and are under investigation in preclinicalassays (Mota Fernandes et al. 2021 ). Although vaccination has been considered one of the most effective public health armaments against numerous diseases, its potential use to prevent fungal infectionswas left behind for years. However, this scenario has changed considerably when these infections became protagonists (Nanjappa and Klein 2014 ). Substantial pro- gress in the knowledge of the host-fungus relation has been made in the last years,with an emphasis on the fungal immune response, fueling the immunotherapeuticarea. New antifungal vaccine formulations are under investigation exploiting diver-sity of immunogens, including proteins, carbohydrates, and lipids (Nimrichter et al.2019 ; Nami et al. 2019 ). In this chapter, we discuss the use of fungal extracellular vesicles as a multi-antigenic vaccine formulation to prevent infections.", "2 Immune Response to Fungal Infections: A Brief", "Introduction Theﬁrst line of defense against invading organisms, including fungal pathogens, is the innate immune system. It includes the physical barriers, particularly the skin andmucosal membranes, such as the mouth, upper airways, and the gastrointestinal andgenitourinary tracts, where fungal pathogens will also compete with other organismsto colonize the host (Borghi et al. 2014 ; Chen et al. 2018 ). Under homeostasis conditions, the host cells will perform the surveillance and distinguish betweencommensal and pathogens (Chen et al. 2018 ). Epithelial barrier damage is followed by the release of in ﬂammatory mediators, including cytokines and antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) (Netea et al. 2015 ). Lactoferricin-B and the defensins HNP-1 are examples of AMPs derived from the innate immune response. Lactoferricin-B isproduced by mucosal epithelial cells and displays anti- Candida activities, while HNP-1 and HNP-3 are released by neutrophils and are active against C. albicans and C. neoformans , respectively (Reddy et al. 2004 ).", "Speci ﬁcally for fungal organisms the cell wall usually de ﬁnes the virulence signature and the magnitude of the immune response (Erwig and Gow 2016 ).", "Cryptococcus species are considered exceptions due to the presence of an additional capsular layer composed mostly of polysaccharides (Fonseca et al. 2019 ). The fungal cell surface contains a number of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs)including chitin, glucans, mannans, complex oligosaccharides, and mannoproteins(Erwig and Gow 2016 ). Although some structures are conserved among differentFungal Extracellular Vesicles as a Potential Strategy for Vaccine Development 12344 fungal species, others are species-speci ﬁc. The cell wall can be remodeled according to fungal growth and environmental conditions (Erwig and Gow 2016 ; Nimrichter et al. 2005 ; Ene et al. 2015 ). In dimorphic pathogenic species, cell wall remodeling can be accompanied by a signi ﬁcant morphological change, where antigens can be hidden, preventing immune surveillance (Hopke et al. 2018 ).", "Fungal PAMPs will trigger the immune response when recognized by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) mostly expressed by host cells from the innate immunesystem (Iwasaki and Medzhitov 2015 ; Romani 2011 ). A large repertoire of receptors carried by innate immune cells is directly involved with the immediate antifungalresponse, such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs), type C lectin receptors (CLRs),NOD-like receptors (NLRs), and RIG-like receptors (RLRs) (Patin et al. 2019 ). Phagocytic cells, including dendritic cells, macrophages, and neutrophils, recognize fungi through PRRs culminating in phagocytosis, cytokine production, and/orreleasing of antimicrobial and oxidative compounds (Iwasaki and Medzhitov2015 ). Macrophages and dendritic cells are considered professional antigen- presenting cells (APCs) and dendritic cells seem to be the major bridge betweenthe innate and the adaptive response, a subject that will be brie ﬂy discussed below. Macrophages are one of the main effector cells and play crucial roles according tothe in ﬂammatory response phase. Their function is de ﬁned by macrophage polarization (Yunna et al. 2020 ). Using a simplistic view, M1 macrophages (classi- cal activation) release IL-1 β, IL-6, IL-12, IL-23, and TNF- αand have an increased ability to produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nitric oxide, showing a fungalkilling pro ﬁle. Macrophages with M2 polarization (alternative activation) can have at least three different subsets and are related to immunomodulation, tissue repair,and remodeling. The main cytokines released by M2 macrophages are IL-10 andTGF- β(Yunna et al. 2020 ). Another parallel arm of the innate immune system involves part of the humoral immunity, with emphasis on the complement system, mannose-binding lectins (MBLs), and antifungal peptides, already mentioned above. In combination, theyprovide an important defense mechanism to combat fungal infections (Romani 2011 ; Hajishengallis et al. 2017 ). The deposition of complement particles to the fungal surface allows the recognition by the complement receptor 3 (CR3; a heterodimer ofCD11b and CD18) an integrin expressed by different immune cells, such as neutro-phils, natural killer cells (NK), and macrophages, inducing phagocytosis of thefungus in a process called opsonophagocytosis (Romani 2011 ). The adaptative immune response is a more speci ﬁc mechanism that starts when antigens derived from the internalized fungal organisms are processed and presentedby APCs to T cells. This step is also modulated by the cytokines initially releasedafter fungal recognition by the connection between PAMPs and PRRs. The correctengagement between APCs and T cells triggers the differentiation of CD4 +T cells into speci ﬁc subtypes of Th cells through the activation of different signaling pathways (Snarr et al. 2017 ). The most prominent pro ﬁles in combating fungal infections are Th1 and Th17 (Romani 2011 ). The immune response will then be guided by the pattern of secreted mediators. For instance, interferon gamma (IFN- γ) release induces cell-mediated immunity by activating and stimulating phagocytic124 L. Honorato et al.45 cells (Li et al. 2019 ). The Th17 pro ﬁle, where the cytokine IL-17 and IL-22 are produced, induces protective and pro-in ﬂammatory responses. These cytokines are responsible for recruiting neutrophils and promoting the release of antimicrobial peptides at the site of infection (Li et al. 2019 ). Intensifying the interplay between AMPs and the Th17 response, recent ﬁndings have demonstrated that cathelicidin, a peptide released by neutrophils, seems to be required for maximal Th17 differenti-ation (Minns et al. 2021 ). Another group with essential participation during fungal protection is the CD8 +T cells, which usually eliminate virus-infected and tumor cells. These cells produce and release cytotoxic granules, such as perforin,granzymes, and granulysins (Cutler et al. 2007 ). Activation of CD8 +T cells can provide protection even in the absence of CD4+T cells, which is considered an important response since systemic fungal infections usually occur in patients with reduced counts of this last T cell subset (Limper et al. 2017 ). Given this scenario, understanding the participation of CD8+T cells against fungal infections can contribute signi ﬁcantly to the development of new immunotherapeutic interventions.", "Activation of antifungal CD8+T cells usually results from cross-presentation, where the agent recognized by the APC is phagocytosed and peptides are presented viaMHC class I (Lindell et al. 2005 ; Kolls et al. 1999 ; Joffre et al. 2012 ).", "3 Antifungal Vaccines", "Vaccination is one of the most effective public health instruments. When properly used, vaccines protect a high percentage of the population against infectious dis-eases, reducing substantially mortality rates and treatment costs (Nanjappa and Klein2014 ; Hajj Hussein et al. 2015 ). In the last decades, vaccines have eliminated or controlled numerous diseases such as measles, polio, and ﬂu (Hajj Hussein et al.", "2015 ; Rappuoli et al. 2014 ). However, despite the high mortality rate of invasive fungal infections, there are no licensed vaccine formulations against these in ﬁrmi- ties. Remarkably, at least half of the studies investigating the use of antifungal vaccines in murine models were published in the last decade, con ﬁrming the recent boost interest in the ﬁeld (Nami et al. 2019 ). Nonetheless, only two vaccines are currently under clinical trials, and both prevent recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis(RVVC), PEV7 and NDV-3/NDV-3A (De Bernardis et al. 2012 ; Schmidt et al. 2012 ; Edwards et al. 2018 ). PEV7 is a virosomal particle carrying a truncated, recombinant secreted aspartyl protease 2 (Sap2) (De Bernardis et al. 2012 ).", "NDV-3 consists of the N-terminus of agglutinin-like sequence 3 fused to a 6-Histag (Als3-6-His), using aluminum hydroxide as adjuvant (Schmidt et al. 2012 ). NDV-3A uses the same formulation but the Als3 lacks the extraneous sequence (Edwards et al. 2018 ). Considering that about 138 million women are affected by RVVC annually, a vaccine to prevent vulvovaginal candidiasis will be a signi ﬁcant advance to their quality of life (Denning et al. 2018 ). In addition, it should substan- tially decrease the use of azoles and echinocandins, reducing the development ofresistant strains. However, these vaccines are not effective against disseminatedFungal Extracellular Vesicles as a Potential Strategy for Vaccine Development 12546 candidiasis. It seems that the major limitation of several vaccines to systemic candidiasis is the use of univalent formulations, a strategy shared by most modernvaccines (Cassone and Rappuoli 2010 ; Cassone 2015 ).C. albicans could escape from a speci ﬁc immune response expressing other virulence traits. In fact, it might also be a drawback for the development of vaccines against other invasive fungalinfections. Since live-attenuated strains would be a risk for immunosuppressedpatients, inactivated (killed) fungi and crude extracts have been extensivelyexploited. For instance, formalin-killed spherules (FKS) of C. immitis showed strong protection in mice models of coccidioidomycosis (Cox and Magee 2004 ). This formulation was investigated in human clinical trials but did not show an effectiveprotection. Autoimmunity and reactogenicity are eventual side effects from these multivalent vaccines, and unambiguous experiments are required to con ﬁrm their safety and tolerability. Furthermore, the inactivation and extraction protocols couldmodify antigenic epitopes and consequently, the immune response (Li et al. 2021 ; Bogahawaththa et al. 2018 ). In this context, the aspects desired in a good vaccine formulation comprises: (1) a cell-free system, harmless to immunosuppressedpatients; (2) the presence of several PAMPs in its native structural composition, soit can induce a strong and speci ﬁc adaptive immune response, (3) the potential to promote cross-reactive protection; (4) low or no reactogenicity with long-lasting immune responses; and (5) the capacity to induce antigen cross-presentation, a stimulus closely linked to particles with nanometric sizes (Silva et al. 2016 ; Bachmann and Jennings 2010 ). As discussed previously, cross presentation is used by APCs to activate CD8 +T cells and could potentially work as an alternative for patients with low CD4+T cells counting. Fungal extracellular vesicles (EVs) seem to gather most of these aspects, if not all.", "4 General Properties of Fungal Extracellular Vesicles (EVs)", "Fungal EVs consist of lipid bilayer membrane compartments that carry a variety of structures, including lipids, proteins, nucleic acid, pigments, glycans, polysaccha- rides, and small metabolites (Da Silva et al. 2015 ; Peres da Silva et al. 2015 ; Rodrigues et al. 2007 ; Vargas et al. 2015 ; Reis et al. 2021 ; Zamith-Miranda et al. 2021 ). Their release is considered a mechanism of transport used virtually by all fungal species to convey a diversity of components to the extracellular environment(Rodrigues et al. 2007 ; Vargas et al. 2015 ; Zamith-Miranda et al. 2021 ; Rizzo et al. 2020a ; Albuquerque 2004 ; Rayner et al. 2017 ; Ikeda et al. 2018 ; Piffer et al. 2021 ; Oliveira et al. 2010a ). In vitro and in vivo studies have con ﬁrmed that fungal EVs are potentially linked to several physiological and pathophysiological processes. They are associated with fungal communication, bio ﬁlm matrix formation and resistance to antifungal drugs, morphology control, disease progress, host cell activation, andantifungal protection in insect and murine models (Vargas et al. 2015 ; Bielska et al. 2018 ; Mitchell et al. 2018 ; Vargas et al. 2020 ; Oliveira et al. 2010b ; Brauer et al. 2020 ; Rizzo et al. 2020b ; Honorato et al. 2021 ). Recent studies also suggest that126 L. Honorato et al.47 fungal EVs can be a source and a new target for antifungal drugs. Peptides carried by EVs from C. gattii showed the ability to control infection in Galleria mellonella larvae (Reis et al. 2021 ). In addition, treatment with turbinmicin, a polyketide isolated from the sea squirt microbiome, signi ﬁcantly reduced the EVs released by C. albicans and impacted the bio ﬁlm formation (Zhao et al. 2021 ). Turbinmicin targets Sec14p, a protein required for the correct trans-Golgi network dynamicsduring the vesicle traf ﬁcking pathway (Zhang et al. 2020 ). Fungal EVs can also be inﬂuenced by the host immune response. In vitro studies demonstrate that galectin-3 has a direct lytic effect in EVs released by C. neoformans , which could be a mechanism used by the immune system to combat cryptococcosis (Almeida et al.2017 ). In addition, antibodies against HSP60, a protein-enriched at the cell wall, were able to regulate the EVs cargo released by H. capsulatum EVs (Matos Baltazar et al. 2016 ; Baltazar et al. 2018 ). The advances in fungal EVs knowledge are exponentially growing in the last years, as well as their potential applications.Here, we will debate why these compartments should be exploited as a new strategyto develop antifungal vaccines.", "5 Fungal Extracellular Vesicles: A Promising Platform", "for New Vaccine Formulations Theﬁrst property displayed by fungal EVs that supports their use in vaccine formulations is that they are non-replicative compartments. Although fungal EVs carry nucleic acids and a diversity of enzymes, their ability to divide was never reported and seems improbable. Thus, they could be safely used in immunocom-promised patients. The capacity of fungal EVs to stimulate a strong immuneresponse is based on the fact these compartments carry several structures withrecognized antigenic properties in their native conformation. For instance, EVsfrom C. albicans yeasts carry Sap2 and Als3p, proteins used as antigens in the vaccines PEV7 and NDV-3 (Vargas et al. 2015 ; Gil-Bona et al. 2015 ). In fact, most of the antigens used in antifungal vaccine preclinical studies were also found in fungal EVs (Table 1).", "As discussed previously in this chapter, the innate immune system is responsible for the ﬁrst antifungal combat. A validation that fungal EVs are modulators of the innate immune response comes from studies showing their effects when incubatedwith phagocytes. Fungal EVs displayed a clear ability to activate these cells,promoting cytokine release, increasing their phagocytic and antimicrobial activities,and speci ﬁcally regulating M1 phenotypes in macrophages (Vargas et al. 2015 ; Ikeda et al. 2018 ; Oliveira et al. 2010b ; Brauer et al. 2020 ; Baltazar et al. 2018 ;d a Silva et al. 2016 ; Zamith-Miranda et al. 2020 ; Peres da Silva et al. 2019 ; Marina et al. 2020 ; Souza et al. 2019 ; Bitencourt et al. 2018 ).

Honorato et al.", "(Baltazar et al. 2018 ). The major reported regulatory effects of fungal EVs in phagocytes are summarized in Fig. 1.", "The impact of fungal EVs in the innate immune system was con ﬁrmed using the insect G. mellonella , a model extensively applied to test fungal virulence and antifungal toxicity and ef ﬁcacy (Arvanitis et al. 2013 ; Jemel et al. 2020 ). The immunological response of G. mellonella involves a group of hemocytes with the ability to recognize and internalize pathogenic organisms. When activated, thesehemocytes use antifungal strategies similar to that used by mammalian phagocytes,including the production of oxidative radicals, antimicrobial peptides, lytic enzymes,and opsonins (Trevijano-Contador and Zaragoza 2018 ). Pre-treatment of G. mellonella larvae with EVs from C. albicans, A. ﬂavus and C. neoformans induced a protective antifungal response. In these experiments, EV-treated anduntreated larvae were subsequently challenged with their correspondent fungalspecies and the pretreatment improved survival rates and reduced fungal burden;excepting for cryptococcosis, where only a delay in the acute lethality was observed(Vargas et al. 2015 ; Vargas et al. 2020 ; Brauer et al. 2020 ; Colombo et al. 2019 ). Although it has been reported that EVs released by C. albicans and C. auris stimulate the expression of MHC class II and co-stimulatory molecules, such as CD86 and CD80, by DCs, the adaptive response induced by fungal EVs is poorly known (Vargas et al. 2015 ; Zamith-Miranda et al. 2020 ). Another advantage of using fungal EVs in vaccine formulations is the presence of several conserved proteinswith antigenic potential, which could induce cross-protection, an issue that remainsto be tested (Piffer et al. 2021 ; Nimrichter et al. 2016 ; Vallejo et al. 2012 ). Vaccine formulations with this property are considered pan-vaccines or universal vaccines(Cassone and Rappuoli 2010 ). The last topic to be discussed here is the effect of the EVs ’size and surface decoration on their uptake and processing by APCs. As reported in other studies, the EVs size of fungal cells ranges between 20 –1000 nm, although most of the particles are usually in the range of 50 –300 nm (reviewed by (Piffer et al. 2021 )).

Treatement of phagocytes with fungal EVs regulate the production o f cytokines, nitric oxide synthesis, stimulate expression of MHC class II and co-stimulatory receptors, induce M1 polarization in macrophages, prom ote transcriptional changes in dendritic cells, and impact fungal phagocytosis and killing by these cells130 L. Honorato et al.51 studies revealed that recognition of fungal EVs from C. albicans andC. neoformans by APCs occurs rapidly. The kinetics of internalization con ﬁrms their presence at the APCs surface 5 min after incubation (Vargas et al. 2015 ). Co-localization with the ganglioside GM1 was demonstrated, suggesting the direct participation of lipids rafts during EVs recognition and internalization. Remarkably, after 15 min, a largeamount of EVs seems to be internalized. Thus, at least for these two species, EVsrecognition and internalization by APCs are very ef ﬁcient. Although there are no reports indicating that antigens from fungal EVs are presented by MHC I complex,cross-presentation seems to be favored when particulate antigens are internalized byAPCs (Silva et al. 2016 ; Lattanzi and Federico 2012 ). In addition, particles within the 10 –200 nm range can be directly drained into the lymph node, which signi ﬁ- cantly improves their uptake by resident DCs, a group of cells with ef ﬁcient cross- presentation capacity (Bachmann and Jennings 2010 ; Swartz 2001 ). Despite the requirement of TLR2 for the activation of macrophages by EVs from Trichophyton interdigitale, no other receptors for fungal EVs have been characterized (Bitencourt et al. 2018 ). However, the presence of mannose decorating the surface of EVs from C. albicans and C. neoformans suggests that their recognition can occur through mannose receptors, TLR4, and dectin-2 (Patin et al. 2019 ; Rizzo et al. 2020b ).", "Previous studies indicate that functionalization of nanoparticles with mannose has been used to enhanced internalization by APCs and to potentiate the CD4 +and CD8+ T cell responses (Zhu et al. 2019 ; Silva et al. 2014 ; Al-Barwani et al. 2014 ).", "Two preclinical studies have used fungal EVs in vaccine formulations. Immuni- zation of BALB/c mice with EVs from C. albicans followed by three boosts induced total and fungal antigen-speci ﬁc serum IgG antibodies after 21 days. Remarkably, full protection was obtained when immunized mice were immunosuppressed withcyclophosphamide and subsequently infected with lethal doses of C. albicans (Vargas et al. 2020 ). These results were supported by a signi ﬁcant decrease of fungal burden in the spleen, kidney, and liver of vaccinated mice .Protection was observed with or without adjuvants, suggesting that the EVs could promote a strong andprotective response in both formulations. However, the cytokine pro ﬁle indicated distinct immunological pro ﬁles. When Freund ’s adjuvant was added to the EVs formulation higher levels of IL-12p70, TNF- αand IFN- γwere found, while IL-12p70, TGF- β, IL-4, and IL-10 were the cytokines increased when EVs were administered alone. These data suggest that the addition of an adjuvant promotes ahigher in ﬂammatory response. It is important to mention that C. albicans EVs kept their ability to protect G. mellonella larvae and activate DCs even after storage at low temperatures, showing a certain degree of stability. More recently, the protectiveeffect of EVs from encapsulated and nonencapsulated strains of C. neoformans was also investigated. Both EVs induced antibody production, and a signi ﬁcative delay in mice death was observed when the animals were immunized with EVs released bythe nonencapsulated strain (Rizzo et al. 2020b ). Protection was associated with the immunogenic proteins Mp88, and the members of Gox and Cda families (Rizzo et al.2020b ; Huang et al. 2002 ; Monari et al. 2005 ; Hayes et al. 2016 ). Although most of the results discussed here support the use of fungal EVs in vaccines, some drawbacks were also reported. When C. neoformans and its EVsFungal Extracellular Vesicles as a Potential Strategy for Vaccine Development 13152 were concomitantly administered in mice, an increased fungal burden was detected in the brain in comparison with control conditions (Huang et al. 2012 ). In addition, immunization of mice with EVs from S. brasiliensis followed by subcutaneous infection with this pathogen resulted in a higher fungal load and an increase in the lesions ’size (Ikeda et al. 2018 ). These negative results are most probably associated with changes in EVs cargo, as supported by previous studies. For instance, EVs froma nonencapsulated strain of C. neoformans induced a higher in ﬂammatory response in macrophages when compared to EVs produced by the encapsulated strain(Oliveira et al. 2010b ). It could be at least partially explained by the absence of glucuronoxylomannan (GXM) in the mutant strains. GXM is a potent anti-inﬂammatory polysaccharide produced by C. neoformans and transported to the extracellular environment through EVs (Snarr et al. 2017 ; Rodrigues et al. 2007 ).", "These results corroborate with the vaccination model discussed above, where onlythe EVs from the nonencapsulated strain delayed the mice ’s death (Rizzo et al.", "2020b ). Furthermore, signi ﬁcant changes in size and cargo have been reported for", "EVs produced by the same fungal strains when cultivated in distinct nutritionalconditions (Piffer et al. 2021; Cleare et al. 2020; Marina et al. 2020). InC. neoformans , these changes were also associated with a distinct immunoregulatory effect for EVs in vitro and in vivo (Marina et al. 2020 ). Together, these results suggest that adequate EVs must be identi ﬁed and exploited in vaccine formulations and some candidates are already standing out. EVs tailoring through genetic engi-neering is a potential alternative to improve their immunogenic properties and deletecompounds that could be involved with disease progression. This strategy has beensuccessfully used for bacterial outer membrane vesicles (Irene et al. 2019 ).", "6 Conclusions", "Growing evidence indicates that immunization is an encouraging strategy to prevent fungal infections. Several formulations have been tested with remarkable advances.", "The plasticity and adaptability of fungal organisms and the fact that the main target population for these pathogens are immunosuppressed patients are the major chal-lenges to be addressed", " Ideal vaccine formulation requires full activation of theinnate and adaptive immune responses with controlled side effects", " Based oncompositional and functional studies, the use of fungal EVs has emerged as apotential strategy", " Fungal EVs carry distinct antigens in their native structure, havenanometric sizes, and are decorated with sugars that could contribute directly to hostcell recognition and antigen processing", " Few studies have tested their ef ﬁcacy in insect and mice models, but the results are promising", " Further experiments are necessary to evaluate the effect of different routes of administration, their cross-protection activity as well as the adaptive mechanism involved", " EVs from differentfungal species must be also compared in in vivo assays", " The use of EVs in antifungalformulations seems to be a promising alternative, but still, there is a long way to bepaved", "132 L", "

Por meio de coloração com cristal violeta e microscopia eletrônica de varredura (MEV), foi visto que as VEs de C. albicans foram capazes de inibir a formação de biofilme in vitro . Por meio de filmagem com microscópio de campo claro e MEV, dem onstramos qu e o tratamento com VEs de C. albicans interrompia a filamentação do fungo e promovia a formação de pseudo -hifas com grandes números de brotamento. A capacidade das VEs de C. albicans em regular a transição morfológica no fungo foi comparada utilizando -se V Es isoladas de diferentes cepas de C. albicans , com uma cepa de Saccharomyces cerevisiae e outra cepa de Histoplasma capsulatum .", "As VEs de C. albicans de diferentes cepas ATCC (10231 e SC5314) também se mostraram capazes de inibir a transição de levedura para hifa em um meio indutor de filamentação, tanto no fungo da cepa ATCC90028 quanto da cepa ATCC10231, com mudanças morfológicas significativas em cerca de 4 horas. As VEs de S. cerevisiae e H. capsulatum também apresen taram efeito inibitório, porém a potência do efeito foi consideravelmente menor , sendo observado apenas 24 horas após adição das VEs . Nossos resultados sugerem que a atividade inibitória das VEs de C. albicans na transição de fase foi promovida em grande p arte por uma combinação de compostos lipídicos, que foram identificados por cromatografia gasosa associada a espectrometria de massa . As principais estruturas caracterizadas e associadas ao processo inibitório foram sesquiterpenos, diterpenos e ácidos grax os de cadeia média .

By time-lapse microscopy and SEM, we showed that C. albicans EV treatment stopped ﬁlamentation and promoted pseudohyphae forma- tion with multiple budding sites. The ability of C. albicans EVs to regulate dimorphism was further compared to EVs isolated from different C. albicans strains, Saccharomyces cerevisiae ,a n d Histoplasma capsulatum .C. albicans EVs from distinct strains inhibited yeast-to-hyphae differentiation with morphological changes occurring in less than 4 h. EVs from S. cerevisiae and H. capsulatum modestly reduced morphogenesis, and the effect was evident after 24 h of incubation. The inhibitory activity of C. albicans EVs on phase transition was promoted by a combination of lipid compounds, which were identi ﬁed by gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis as sesquiterpenes, diterpenes,and fatty acids.

Apart from external inducers, C. albicans also produces autoregulatory substances. Farnesol and tyrosol are examples of quorum-sensing molecules (QSM) released by C. albicans to regulate yeast-to-hypha conversion. Here, we demonstrate that fungal EVs are messengers impacting bio ﬁlm formation, morphogenesis, and virulence in C. albicans . The major players exported in C. albicans EVs included sesquiterpenes, diterpenes, and fatty acids. The understanding of how C. albicans cells communicate to regulate physiol- ogy and pathogenesis can lead to novel therapeutic tools to combat candidiasis.", "KEYWORDS bioﬁlm,Candida albicans , extracellular vesicles, lipids, yeast-to-hypha inhibition Candida albicans is a common colonizer of the human skin and mucosa (1 –3).", "However, in circumstances where the epithelial barrier, the immune system, and/ or the microbiome are compromised, this species can overgrow and cause diseases that range from super ﬁcial to disseminated, life-threatening infections (4 –6). The ability ofC. albicans to colonize host tissues is associated with a combination of virulence fac- tors and ﬁtness attributes (4). Among them, a major strategic feature that facilitates C. albicans ’s ability to persist in different environments is the capacity to switch mor- phological stages, which is a tightly regulated process called dimorphism, developed by fungal organisms (7).", "Different environmental stimuli can induce dimorphism in C. albicans . For instance, yeast-to-hypha differentiation is stimulated by N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc), neutral pH, serum supplementation at 37°C, 5% CO2, low nitrogen and amino acids, and diverse other factors (8 –12). Dimorphism in C. albicans can also be controlled by quo- rum sensing (QS), a mechanism of microbial communication (13, 14). Farnesol (FOH), farnesoic acid, and tyrosol are major morphogenesis-related QS molecules (QSMs) pro- duced by C. albicans (15–17), although other alcohols derived from amino acids have been also characterized (18). FOH and farnesoic acid prevent yeast-to-hypha differen-tiation with no effects on growth rates (17 –19). Tyrosol stimulates germ tube and hypha formation (15). These QSMs are also able to regulate bio ﬁlm formation (20, 21). The ability of free fatty acids to inhibit C. albicans ﬁlamentation and bio ﬁlm formation has also been reported (22 –24).", "Since the ﬁrst description of fungal extracellular vesicles (EVs) by Rodrigues et al. in 2007 (25), studies have shown that fungal organisms use these compartments as a mechanism of molecular exportation (26 –39). Heterogeneous populations of EVs con- taining lipids, proteins, polysaccharides, pigments, and nucleic acids cross the cell wall outward, reaching the extracellular environment (25, 28, 31, 33, 38, 40). Their implication during pathological and physiological processes is under investigation by a number ofgroups (29, 37, 41 –43). Recently, Bielska and colleagues have shown that EVs isolated from a virulent strain of Cryptococcus gattii are ef ﬁciently taken up by macrophages pre- viously infected with a nonvirulent strain of the same species (29). Inside phagocytes, the EVs derived from the virulent strain promoted rapid intracellular fungal growth andtransferred virulence characteristics to the nonvirulent strain through a mechanismdependent on intact vesicles. The presence of stable RNA and proteins in the EVs was required (29). EVs also have a critical role during bio ﬁlm matrix production and drug resistance in C. albicans (44, 45).", "In this work, we demonstrate that EVs produced by C. albicans cells ( C. albicans EVs) impacted bio ﬁlm formation, yeast-to-hypha differentiation, and virulence. Our results reveal previously unknown roles of fungal EVs that impact the physiology and patho-genesis of C. albicans . RESULTS EVs produced by C. albicans inhibit bio ﬁlm formation. We began our studies using two distinct approaches to investigate the in ﬂuence of fungal EVs during bio ﬁlm formation.

Our results showed that the presence of yeast-derived C. albicans EVs negatively impacted bio ﬁlm formation in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1A). The highest density of EVs (sterol concentration corresponding to 5 mg/mL) reduced optical density (OD) measurements by approximately 80 to 85% compared to controls with no C. albicans EV stimulation. In a second test, to avoid any in ﬂuence of EVs during the adhesion step, yeasts were added to the wells and incubated for 90 min. Then, the nonadherent cells were removed, and the EVs were added. Similar results wereobserved, suggesting that the activity of the EVs was independent of the adhesion step (Fig. 1B). SEM images obtained after 24 h of growth (experimental conditions of Fig. 1A) showed that the bio ﬁlm formed in the absence of C. albicans EVs (control condition) exhibited a standard architecture, with the presence of hyphae, pseudohyphae, and yeast cells attached to the coverslip (Fig. 1C). In contrast with control conditions where the three morphological stages were found, few yeast cells were visualized attached to the coverslip under the condition with EVs present (Fig. 1D). Thus, under the conditions used in our experiments, EVs signi ﬁcantly reduced yeast cell attachment and impaired bio ﬁlm formation in C. albicans . EV concentrations used in these experiments were initially based on previous studies performed by Bielska and colleagues (29).", "FIG 1 EVs from C. albicans inhibit bio ﬁlm formation and yeast-to-hyphae differentiation. Both protocols described in Materials and Methods for EV isolation were used with identical results. The results presented here were obtained from C. albicans 90028 EVs (yeast cells) isolated from liquid culture medium. (A) C. albicans (90028) (105yeasts) were inoculated into RPMI-MOPS in the presence or absence of C. albicans 90028 EVs. Different concentrations of EVs (0.5, 1, and 5 mg/mL, based on sterol content) were added to wells containing C. albicans (90028) yeasts, and cells were incubated to develop bioﬁlm for 24 and 48 h in 96-well microplates. (B) C. albicans (90028) (105yeasts) were inoculated into RPMI-MOPS and incubated for 90 min. The nonadherent cells were washed out, and fresh medium containing C. albicans 90028 EVs (0.5, 1, and 5 mg/mL, based on sterol content) was added. PBS was used as control. Bio ﬁlm formation was quanti ﬁed by crystal violet method.

EVs from C. albicans inhibit yeast-to-hypha differentiation. The ability of C. albi- cans 90028 EVs to inhibit bio ﬁlm formation suggested that EVs could control morpho- genesis in C. albicans strain 90028. We then monitored microscopically the impact of C. albicans EVs on yeast-to-hypha differentiation induced by M199 medium at 37°C. In the absence of C. albicans EVs (control condition), the yeast cells adhered to the solid substrate (Fig. 1E, left) and formed germ tubes after 1 to 2 h of incubation. This step was followed by true hypha formation. Few branching hyphae and yeast cells werevisualized after 8 h, but hyphae represented the predominant morphological stage. The time-lapse microscopy of 18 h of incubation is presented as Movie S1 at 10.6084/", ". In contrast, the addition of EVs drastically changed the pheno-", "type observed (Fig. 1E , right, and Movie S2 at 10.6084/m9. ﬁgshare.19403894 ).", "Although the yeast cells were attached to the plate and started to form germ tubes, the development of true hypha after elongation was not observed (Fig. 1E , right, and Movie S2 at 10.6084/m9. ﬁgshare.19403894 ). Instead, the appearance of constrictions on elongated cells suggested the development of pseudohyphae after 4 to 7 h. In addition, the cells exposed to C. albicans 90028 EVs lost their ability to adhere to the well after 6 h of incubation (Movie S2). Multiple budding points, potentially related to faster growth, were observed along the pseudohyphae, and after 24 h, only yeast cells were detected (Fig. 1E , right, and Fig. 1F). Long pseudohyphae ﬁlaments with yeast cells clusters were observed, including a large number of yeast cells derived from pseu- dohyphae (Fig. 1E, right). Furthermore, there was no indication of cytotoxicity under these conditions since all the yeast cells were able to grow (Movie S2 at 10.6084/m9 .ﬁgshare.19403894 ). SEM images show the ultrastructural details of pseudohyphae.", "Multiple budding yeasts and several bud scars were observed in the experiments with C. albicans 90028 EVs added (Fig. 1F ). This phenomenon of yeast induction occurred in a dose-dependent manner. A minimum density of C. albicans EVs, equivalent to 0.3 to 0.6mg sterol/mL, was required to inhibit morphogenesis at least partially (Fig. 2A).", "However, the inhibitory activity was not dependent on the number of yeast cells sincedifferent cell suspensions (1.5 /C210", "3to 3.5 /C2104yeast cells/well) were similarly", "affected using the same density (5 mg sterol/mL) of EVs (data not shown).", "Remarkably, a single treatment with EVs was suf ﬁcient to impact the yeast-to-hypha differentiation for at least 72 h (Fig. 2B). Aliquots of pretreated yeast cells (2.5 /C2103 yeast cells/well) were washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and plated onto fresh and EV-free M199 medium. The culture was monitored microscopically for 24 h and then transferred again to fresh medium without additional EVs. This process wasrepeated three times, and aliquots from 48 and 72 h were added to fresh M199 me- dium for continued microscopic monitoring. Regular hypha formation was observed only after 96 h, 4 days after the initial addition of EVs.", "To certify that the inhibitory effect of C. albicans 90028 EVs was not due to coisolated contaminants, we fractioned our bioactive samples using size exclusion chromatography (SEC) in a Sepharose CL-4B column. A single peak (fractions 8 to 10) containing proteinsand lipids was observed (Fig. S1A and B at 10.6084/m9. ﬁgshare.19403894 ). Dynamic light scattering (DLS) analysis con ﬁrmed the presence of EVs in fraction 8 (Fig. S1C at 10.6084/ m9.ﬁgshare.19403894 ), corresponding to the most concentrated sample with larger amounts of lipids and proteins, but not in the adjacent ones. Two populations were char- acterized with average sizes previously reported in our studies (31 ), ranging from 50 to 120 and 240 to 350 nm, and possibly corresponding to exosomes and ectosomes/micro-particles, respectively. The inhibitory activity of the lipids from each fraction was then evaluated. The addition of fraction 8 to yeast cultures inhibited the yeast-to-hypha differ- entiation of C. albicans after 6 h of incubation (Fig. S1D at 10.6084/m9. ﬁgshare ). In contrast, fraction 10, where the protein and lipid concentrations were sig- niﬁcantly reduced compared to fraction 8, did not modify morphogenesis as ef ﬁcient hyphae formation occurred. The other fractions in which lipids and proteins were notdetected did not inhibit phase transitions (data not shown).Populational Functions of Fungal EVs mBio Month YYYY Volume XX Issue XX 10.1128/mbio.00301-22 4 Downloaded from https://journals.asm.org/journal/mbio on 14 April 2022 by 146.164.21.7. General properties of EVs produced by different C. albicans strains. EVs pro- duced by different strains of C. albicans were isolated from culture supernatants and compared using nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) (46). The size distribution of the EVs produced by C. albicans strains used in this work ranged from 100 to 500 nm (Fig. 3A to C), similar to measurements published for EVs released by C. albicans and other fungal species (31, 46). EVs released by strains SC5314 and 10231 were compara-ble to each other, ranging from 100 to 400 nm (Fig. 3A and C). EVs produced by strain", "90028 were mainly composed of smaller particles, ranging between 100 to 250 nm,", "but also contained minor populations between 300 and 350 nm and 420 to 480 nm(Fig. 3B). Considering that the C. albicans strains released EVs with distinct average size, we normalized our experiments using the total content of sterol in each vesicle prepa- ration, as used in previous studies from our group (31, 34). Of note, this method is highly reproducible and requires small amounts of samples.", "The ability of EVs to inhibit yeast-to-hypha differentiation is reproducible in other strains of C. albicans .We investigated whether the ability to inhibit yeast-to-hypha differentiation was reproducible in EVs obtained from other strains of C. albicans .T h u s ,E V s were isolated from strains with distinct abilities to cause infection. For instance, strain 10231 is less virulent and does not produce FOH (47). Instead, it produces farnesoic acid, an FOH derivative at least 10-fold less active in its ability to inhibit yeast-to-hypha conversion (19).Strains 90028 and SC5314, on the other hand, are regular producers of FOH (17). The resultspresented in Fig. 3D showed that C. albicans EVs from 10231 and SC5314 inhibited hypha formation of strain 90028. However, EVs from these other strains exhibited a reduced effect FIG 2 The inhibitory effect of EVs from C. albicans (strain 90028) on yeast-to-hypha conditions is dose dependent and has a long-term effect. (A) C. albicans (90028) yeasts were inoculated into M199 (pH 7) in the presence or absence of C. albicans 90028 EVs in different concentrations (equivalent to 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.6, 1, 1.2, 2.5, and 5 mg sterol/mL). Bar, 30 mm. (B) The inhibitory effect of a single C. albicans EV treatment was tested after 24, 48, 72, and 96 h. Brie ﬂy, overnight-treated yeasts were washed with sterile PBS, and aliquots of (2.5 /C2103cells/well) cells were transferred to fresh M199 medium. Yeasts were incubated under the same conditions without addition of EVs for 24 h, and the differentiation was accompanied microscopically. This step was repeated until the reestablishment of C. albicans ﬁlamentation. Bar, 30 mm.

To con ﬁrm that the effect was not strain speci ﬁc, we evaluated the effect of the EVs produced by strains 10231 and 90028 on the morphogenesis of strain 10231 (Fig. 3E). The EV-mediated inhibition of ﬁlamentation of strain 10231 was con ﬁrmed. The recovery of EVs was similar using solid or liquid medium (average of 0.16 and 0.18 mg of sterol/109cells, respectively). Further experiments were performed using EVs produced by the 90028 strain cultivated in liquid medium since this condition resulted in better yields of EVs.", "EV molecules with yeast-to-hypha inhibitory activity are thermoresistant and enriched in preparations containing nonpolar lipids. The ability to prevent yeast-to- hypha differentiation was preserved by C. albicans 90028 EVs after heating them at 90°C for 15 min (Fig. 4A), suggesting that thermoresistant molecules could be mediating theinhibitory effect. Since lipids participate in C. albicans morphogenesis (16, 21), we extracted and fractioned the lipid components contained in C. albicans 90028 EVs and tested their inhibitory activity. The crude lipid extract was partitioned using standardized protocols to enrich lipids according to their polarity (48), and the organic (lower and upper) phases were added to yeast suspensions in M199 medium for microscopic moni-toring of morphogenesis. The lower phase (LP) activity was very similar to C. albicans 90028 EVs in its ability to inhibit differentiation (Fig. 4B). Although the upper phase (UP) was also active, its effect was observed only after 24 h of incubation. The precipitate FIG 3 EVs from different C. albicans strains inhibit yeast-to-hyphae transition of strains 90028 and 10231. NTA pro ﬁle of EVs produced by C. albicans strains SC5314 (A), 90028 (B), and 10231 (C) showed similar properties of EVs. C. albicans yeast cells of strains 90028 (D) or 10231 (E) were inoculated into M199 (pH 7) in the presence or absence of C. albicans EVs (equivalent to 5 mg sterol/mL) from distinct strains of C. albicans (90028, 10231, and SC5314). The effects were visualized after 4, 8, and 24 h. PBS was added alone as a control. Bar, 30 mm.

(protein-rich fraction [PF]) obtained from C. albicans 90028 EV lipid extraction, likely rich in proteins, had no apparent in ﬂuence on morphogenesis (Fig. 4B). The LP of lipids extracted from the whole cells were also able to inhibit C. albicans differentiation (data not shown). LP obtained from liquid Sabouraud (no yeast cells, control medium) usingthe same extraction and partition protocol showed no activity (data not shown). EVs produced by other fungal species affect yeast-to-hypha differentiation in C. albicans .Based on the lipid nature of the bioactive molecules studied in our work and the fact that FOH and farnesoic acid are QSM lipids that control yeast-to-hypha dif-ferentiation in C. albicans (16, 21, 23), we hypothesized that the presence of FOH and farnesoic acid in EVs from C. albicans could result in ﬁlamentation inhibition. To con- ﬁrm this possibility, we asked whether EVs from S. cerevisiae , which synthesizes and exports FOH in very small amounts (49), would regulate morphogenesis in C. albicans . We also included EVs from H. capsulatum in these analyses since FOH or FOH deriva- tives have not been characterized as lipid components in this fungus. We ﬁrst investi- gated whether the strains used in our study produced detectable amounts of FOH intothe LP by reverse-phase thin-layer chromatography (TLC). Whole cells were used inorder to obtain larger amounts of lipids. The TLC showed a sharp band in the LP ofC. albicans (strain 90028) with identical color and retention factor ( R f) obtained for an FIG 4 Thermoresistant molecules carried by C. albicans EVs are associated with yeast-to-hyphae inhibitory effect.

FOH standard, strongly indicating the presence of this molecule in the C. albicans extract (Fig. S2A at 10.6084/m9. ﬁgshare.19403894 ). A band with a similar Rfwas observed in the LP of H. capsulatum ; however, a distinct yellowish color was visualized (Fig. S2A). Thus, a more detailed structural analysis was necessary to con ﬁrm the chem- ical nature of that band, as further described in this section. No molecules migrating asFOH were detected in the LP from S. cerevisiae . Nevertheless, EVs from these three spe- cies were able to impair C. albicans hypha formation (Fig. S2B at .19403894 ). Clearly, the kinetics of inhibition (comparing 8 h versus 24 h of incubation time) observed for EVs released by H. capsulatum and S. cerevisiae , as well as for C. albi- cans 10231 EVs, were considerably slower than C. albicans 90028 EVs. With H. capsula- tum EVs, the inhibitory effect was observed only after an overnight incubation. The ﬁrst signals of inhibitory effect from S. cerevisiae EVs were detected after 8 h of incubation, an effect comparable with EVs from C. albicans strain 10231 (Fig. 3D ). To con ﬁrm that the inhibitory effect was not pleiotropic, caused by EVs produced by any of the organ-isms studied, we also tested the activity of EVs from murine macrophages-like (MOs).Contrasting with the activity of fungal EVs, MO EVs did not interfere with yeast-to-hypha differentiation in vitro (Fig. S2B at 10.6084/m9. ﬁgshare.19403894 ). The fact that EVs lacking or expressing reduced levels of FOH inhibit C. albicans differentiation, even at a lower ef ﬁcacy, suggests that other EV molecules, in addition to FOH, also partici- pate in the inhibitory mechanisms. We next investigated whether other lipids could be potentially involved in the inhibitory effect of EVs.", "Terpenes and fatty acids are the major compounds potentially involved with C.", "albicans yeast-to-hypha inhibition. To investigate whether other lipids produced by C. albicans 90028 could mediate the inhibitory activity of C. albicans EVs, we tested the dis- tinct TLC bands from the C. albicans LP extract. Using a preparative TLC plate and staining the lipids with mild iodine vapor, to avoid lipid degradation, we obtained ﬁve major frac- tions (A to E) corresponding to separate bands (Fig. S3 at 10.6084/m9. ﬁgshare.19403894 ). The ability of each fraction to inhibit yeast-to-hypha differentiation was investigated, andonly one (band A), with an R fsimilar to an authentic FOH standard, showed an active effect (Fig. S3).", "We then concentrated our efforts on the analysis of FOH in fungal EVs and lipid extracts. To that end, we followed a protocol previously used for FOH extraction andemployed a highly sensitive gas chromatography-mass spectrometry with selectedreaction monitoring (GC-MS/SRM) method, using an external bona ﬁde standard of FOH (50, 51). As observed in Fig. 5A and B (black line), the FOH standard (at 4.5 pmol/ mL, 1mL injection) is comprised of a mixture of four isomers (2- cis,6-cis-farnesol [Z,Z- FOH], 2- cis,6-trans -farnesol [Z,E-FOH], 2- trans ,6-cis-farnesol [E,Z-FOH], and 2- trans ,6- trans -farnesol [E,E-FOH]), which clearly separated from each other using the GC gradi- ent conditions employed. The isomer pro ﬁle was comparable to that previously reported (51). Under the experimental conditions used for the standard mixture, wedetected peaks (at 9.65 and 9.81 min) with SRM transitions (not shown) and full-scanchromatogram elution times similar to Z,E-FOH and E,E-FOH isomers (peaks 3 and 5,respectively) in the C. albicans 90028 yeast EV sample (Fig. 5A and B). Table 1 shows the relative peak intensity of these FOH isomers and other identi ﬁed compounds found in fungal EVs and other lipid fractions. Besides the two FOH isomers, the GC-MSanalysis revealed that C. albicans 90028 EVs contained large amounts of other terpe- noids or isoprenoids such as geranylgeraniol isomers and, to a much lesser extent,squalene (Table 1). Using the standard calibration curve from the d6-E,E-FOH isomer, we quanti ﬁed the amounts of each isoprenoid/terpenoid found in the fungal EVs (Table 2), con ﬁrming the results above and showing a signi ﬁcant enrichment of isoprenoids in EVs carried by C. albicans strain 90028. The FOH derivative 2,3-dihydro-6- trans -farnesol (6, 10-dodecadie- nol-1-ol, 3,7,11 trimethyl) (peak 1) and related isoprenoid, 2,3-dihydro-6- trans -geraniol (6,10,14-hexadecatrien-1-ol, 3,7,11,15 tetramethyl) (peak 9), corresponding to FOH andgeranylgeraniol units lacking a double bond at C-2, respectively, were also characterizedas major peaks (Fig. 5; Tables 1 and 2).

In the experimental condi- tions used, we could not detect any FOH or DHFOH isomers in the C. albicans 10231 LP and EVs, suggesting that the ability to produce FOH in this strain is completely abro- gated (Fig. S4; Fig. 5 ; Tables 1 and 2). The peak observed at 9.58 min by GC-MS analysis, with similar retention time as Z,E-FOH, was identi ﬁed as a contaminant in the NIST mass spectral library (Fig. S4 and Table S1 at 10.6084/m9. ﬁgshare.19403894 ). Of those isopre- noids, only 2,3-dihydro-6- trans -geraniol was also found in H. capsulatum and S. cerevisiae EVs. None of the FOH isomers or its derivative (2,3-dihydro-6- trans -farnesol [dihydrofarnesol or DHFOH]) were detected in the EVs from H. capsulatum and S. cerevisiae ,c o nﬁrming that these molecules are only enriched in C. albicans 90028 EVs (Fig. 5 ;T a b l e s1a n d2 ) .T o g e t h e r ,t h e s e data con ﬁrm that although the terpenes considerably increased the inhibitory activity of C. albicans 9 0 0 2 8E V s ,t h e ya r en o tt h eo n l yl i p i d sa b l et oc o n t r o l C. albicans ﬁlamentation. The other class of lipids recognized to inhibit hyphal growth and bio ﬁlm formation inC. albicans is the fatty acids (22, 23, 52). In our analysis, ﬁve fatty acids were identi- ﬁed as major C. albicans 90028 EV components, including octadecanoic (stearic acid, C18:0) and octadecenoic (oleic acid, C18:1) acids, and, to a much lesser extent, (9Z)-hexa- dec-9-enoic (palmitoleic acid, C16:1), dodecanoic (lauric acid, C12:0), and tetradecanoic (myristic acid, C14:0) acids (Fig. 5 and Table 1). Remarkably, larger amounts of myristic and stearic acid were found enriched in C. albicans 10231 EVs, along with small amounts of pentadecyclic acid, C16:1and C18:1(Fig. S4). Fatty acids were also found in EVs from H. capsulatum (C12:0,C14:0, and C18:0) and S. cerevisiae (C12:0,C14:0,C16:1,C18:0, and C18:1) (Fig. 5 and Table 1). Large amounts of ascorbic acid 2,6-dihexadecanoate were FIG 5 GC-MS analysis of fungal lipids and EVs. Lipids were extracted from the C. albicans 90028 LP fraction and EVs and from the RP-TLC band comigrating with farnesol in the two samples. Lipidswere also extracted from H. capsulatum and S. cerevisiae EVs. The resulting samples were analyzed by GC-MS/MS. (A) GC-MS full-scan chromatogram.

Equivalent amounts of DHFOH and E,E-FOH were detected in C. albicans 90028 LP (Table 1). The derivative 2,3-dihydro-6- trans -geraniol was also identi ﬁed in C. albicans 90028 LP (Tables 1 and 2). Moreover, the free fatty acids C12:0,C14:0,C18:0, and C18:1were also characterized in this fraction. Finally, we resolved the lipids from C. albicans 90028 EVs by RP-TLC, and the band corresponding to the FOH Rfwas also analyzed. We found a high similarity between the total EV lipids and this band, with a clear enrichment of FOH isomers and FOH-like structures andother isoprenoids/terpenoids (Tables 1 and 2). In addition, we observed an enrichment of the fatty acids C 12:0and C14:0, and dodecanoic acid undecyl ester (C23:0-O2) (Fig. 5A and Table 1).", "DHFOH and FOH similarly reproduce the effects of C. albicans EVs on ﬁlamentation. As mentioned previously, FOH is a major QSM produced by C. albicans with the ability to block ﬁlamentation (17, 53). Given that the major terpenes carried by EVs from C. albicans strain 90028 are DHFOH and 2,3-dihydro-6- trans -geraniol (Table 1), we investigated the ef ﬁcacy of a commercially available, synthetic DHFOH to inhibit C. albicans ﬁlamentation.

The bona ﬁde standard exhibited an activity similar to FOH (Fig. 6A and B). Of note, the biological activities of commercial FOH and DHFOH were considerably reduced within a few weeks in stock solution at 220°C (data not shown). On the other hand, synthetic geranylgeraniol and ascorbic acid 2,6-dihexadecanoate were not able to interfere with yeast-to-hypha differentiation (datanot shown). Unfortunately, 2,3-dihydro-6- trans -geraniol, observed in C. albicans 90028 LP and EVs (Fig. 5 and Table 1), was not commercially available as synthetic or puri ﬁed compound, and therefore, its biological activity could not be con ﬁrmed.", "EVs from C. albicans yeast cells reverse the yeast-to-hypha differentiation. We next investigated whether C. albicans EVs were able to reverse the yeast-to-hypha dif- ferentiation induced by M199 medium. Yeast cells were plated onto M199, and hyphaformation was observed after 4 h of induction (Fig. 6B), at which time C. albicans EVs, FOH, or DHFOH were added to the wells. Yeast cells were visualized 4 h after the addi-tion of C. albicans EVs to the ﬁlamentous cultures, indicating that fungal EVs and the terpenes were able to ef ﬁciently reverse the yeast-to-hypha morphogenesis, even after the highly regulated process had been initiated.", "Inhibitory activity caused by C. albicans EVs is reversed by db-cAMP addition.", "FOH stops C. albicans ﬁlamentation by inhibiting adenylate cyclase (Cyr1) (54). This effect is rescued in vitro by the addition of exogenous db-cAMP (55). To investigate whether the EVs ’inhibitory effect is mediated by Cyr1 repression, we performed two experiments. First, we incubated db-cAMP and C. albicans 90028 EVs for 1 h and then added the mixture to C. albicans yeasts. Under these experimental conditions, the db- cAMP had no effect, and the inhibitory activity was similar to C. albicans EVs alone (Fig. 7). These results indicated that the EVs are not inhibiting Cyr1 and suggested thatother signaling mechanisms could be involved. However, we cannot rule out that theEVs sequestered or hydrolyzed the db-cAMP. To address these possibilities, we ﬁrst treated C. albicans yeasts with EVs for 1 h, and then db-cAMP was added to the system. Under these conditions, the ﬁlamentation was observed after 8 h, con ﬁrming that Cyr1 FIG 6 C. albicans EVs, FOH, and DHFOH reversed the yeast-to-hypha differentiation.

However, after 24 h, we observed that the control conditions (PBS) exhibited a higher proportion of hyphae than the conditionswhere db-cAMP was added to yeasts pretreated with EVs. These results suggested thatalthough Cyr1 seems to be a major target for C. albicans EVs, other mechanisms might also be involved.", "Treatment with EVs reduces the ability of C. albicans to penetrate solid medium and decreases fungal virulence in a Galleria mellonella model of candidiasis. Due to the well-established connections between pathogenesis and morphological transitions inC. albicans (12), we investigated whether treatment with C. albicans EVs could abro- gate the ability of the fungus to penetrate solid medium, a consequence of ﬁlamen- tous growth regularly correlated with virulence (56). Colonies of C. albicans cultivated in M199 agar medium produced normal hypha at the edges after 5 to 6 days of inva-sive growth (Fig. 8A, top left panel). In contrast, after 5 to 6 days, no hyphae werevisualized when yeast cells were pretreated with C. albicans EVs (Fig. 8A, top right panel). In fact, under C. albicans EV treatment conditions, hypha formation was only observed after 10 to 11 days of incubation (data not shown). These results were con-ﬁrmed using the plate-washing method (56). After 10 days of growth, the colonies (control and EV treated) were washed using the same ﬂow rate, water temperature, and duration of time (Fig. 8A, bottom panels), producing results that were similar to those obtained under standard conditions.", "The capacity to reduce the adhesive and invasive abilities of C. albicans indicated that preincubation of yeast cells with C. albicans EVs could decrease the virulence of C. albicans . To investigate whether the treatment of yeast cells with EVs would impact pathogenesis, we used G. mellonella as a model. Infection of G. mellonella larvae with a lethal inoculum of yeast cells of C. albicans cultivated in standard medium without C. albicans EVs caused melanization and death in 80% of the animals in less than 1 week (Fig. 8B). Remarkably, when the pretreated yeast cells were used to infect the larvae,only 5 to 10% of the animals died (Fig. 8B, experiments 1 and 2). We then evaluatedthe ability of EVs to impair C. albicans differentiation in the presence of serum, a major hyphae-inducing factor in mammalian hosts (57). Our results demonstrated that C. albi- cans EVs were able to inhibit yeast-to-hypha differentiation in the presence of serum and CO 2(Fig. 8C). Together, these data suggested that C. albicans EVs could directly affect the pathogenesis of C. albicans during the infection.", "DISCUSSION Our results demonstrated that the addition of C. albicans 90028 EVs strongly inhib- ited bio ﬁlm development of C. albicans . In addition, their ﬁlamenting-suppressing ac- tivity was similar to the effect of FOH. The effect was notably prolonged, indicatingthat yeast-to-hyphae morphogenesis was temporarily turned off.

In addition to epi-genetic modi ﬁcations, other changes triggered by C. albicans 90028 EVs could also be expected and should also be further investigated. For instance, C. albicans EV-treated cells lost their ability to adhere to the plates ’wells after 7 h of incubation, suggesting that treatment with C. albicans EVs caused alterations on the fungal surface composi- tion. Although the activity of C. albicans 90028 EVs was dose dependent, the inhibitory effect was apparently not linked to yeast density in fungal cultures.", "These data suggest that the C. albicans 90028 EV components involved with morpho- genesis must reach a threshold concentration to inhibit differentiation, a circumstancethat is well-known for the QSM FOH and tyrosol (15, 17). This hypothesis agrees withthe ordinary physiological transition between yeast and hyphal forms, which would not occur regularly if EVs or other extracellular regulators were inhibitory at minimum concentrations. Altogether, these results indicate that C. albicans EVs carry a group of terpenes and fatty acids able to regulate growth and morphogenesis in C. albicans .A recent work published by Bitencourt and colleagues (59) also suggested that fungalEVs could be involved in fungal intraspecies communication and could regulate C. albi- cans dimorphism. However, in contrast with our results, those authors demonstrated that C. albicans EVs produced by yeasts induced ﬁlamentation, although EVs from hyphae exhibited a more prominent effect. In addition, their experiments also sug-gested that EVs stimulated C. albicans growth, a result not exploited but consistently FIG 8 C. albicans EVs decrease the capacity of C. albicans to penetrate agar and attenuate virulence in Galleria mellonella .

These differences might have resulted from the use by Bitencourt et al. (59) of a distinct C. albicans strain (ATCC 64548) and a different culture condition (YPD medium), which could modify the EV composition, as previously reported (60). Moreover, their experimental conditions were limited to 4 h of ﬁlamenta- tion, when the morphological impact of EVs was just initiating in our experiments.", "These contrasting effects reinforce the relevance of further investigating EVs in fungalphysiology. To con ﬁrm that C. albicans uses EV export as a general mechanism to control yeast growth and morphogenesis in vitro , we isolated C. albicans EVs from two other C. albi- cans strains with distinct ﬁlamentation abilities and virulence pro ﬁles and tested their capacity to inhibit yeast-to-hyphae differentiation. Our data revealed that these three different strains of C. albicans produced EVs with similar properties, which were also comparable to other fungal EVs, as recently characterized by Reis and colleagues using similar detection approaches with C. gattii (46). In addition, small differences in EVs size were observed when the distinct strains were compared, con ﬁrming previous data published by our group showing that C. albicans strains produced EVs with distinct dimensions (31). Morphological differences of EVs are usually attributed to changes in composition and/or biogenesis pathways. EVs released by the strain 90028 were able to inhibit ﬁlamentation of all tested C. albicans strains. Furthermore, C. albicans EVs from different strains also exhibited the ability to block ﬁlamentation of C. albicans strain 10231. Thus, the C. albicans EVs ’capacity of inhibiting yeast-to-hypha differentia- tion appears to be a conserved mechanism.", "A number of compounds carried by fungal EVs could be involved with growth and morphogenesis control, including lipids, proteins, and RNA. The participation of ther-molabile molecules was discarded since the ﬁlamentation inhibition is observed even when the C. albicans EVs are heated. Since lipids are thermostable, these results sug- gest that a lipid compound could be responsible by the C. albicans EV-mediated inhibi- tory activity. Given that FOH is a lipid that regulates morphogenesis in C. albicans ,w e speculate that this molecule could be the component mediating the yeast-to-hypha in-hibitory effect. Nevertheless, FOH is not produced by the C. albicans strain 10231 and has never been characterized in H. capsulatum . Our TLC results con ﬁrm the presence of an FOH band with inhibitory activity in C. albicans strain 90028, but not in H. capsula- tum orS. cerevisiae lipid extracts. However, it is possible that the colorimetric method used in our experiments was not suf ﬁciently sensitive to detect small amounts of FOH. In addition, it was still necessary to con ﬁrm that FOH is addressed to C. albicans EVs at appropriate concentrations to inhibit ﬁlamentation.", "Our GC-MS analysis strongly indicates the presence of lipids in C. albicans EVs that could interfere with morphogenesis, including a family of terpenes and medium-chain fatty acids (17, 22). Besides FOH, other sesquiterpenes and diterpenes are major com-pounds characterized in the C. albicans 90028 EVs. Of note, the proportion of terpene species in C. albicans EVs is distinct from the LP and displays the largest amounts of FOH isomers. In addition, no FOH has been found in EVs released by the C. albicans strain 10231, S. cerevisiae , and H. capsulatum , which may explain why they have a dis- tinct kinetic to inhibit differentiation compared to EVs released by C. albicans strain In previous studies, the inhibitory concentration of FOH affecting C. albicans differ- entiation in vitro was shown to be in the range of 1 to 150 According to our quantitative analysis, the sterol/protein weight ratio was 1:20 (data not shown). Most of our experiments were developed using a sterol concentration of 5mg/mL of EV suspension, corresponding to a protein concentration of 100 mg/mL.", "Considering the lowest concentration of FOH used in previous studies (1 mM), the amount of puri ﬁed FOH required for yeast-to-hyphae inhibition was 222.3 ng/mL. As demonstrated in Table 2, an EV suspension able to inhibit ﬁlamentation contained approximately 11.3 ng/mL of FOH, corresponding to the sum of both Z,E-FOH and E,E- FOH isomers. Thus, it was expected that FOH alone was not fully responsible for thePopulational Functions of Fungal EVs mBio Month YYYY Volume XX Issue XX 10.1128/mbio.00301-22 14 Downloaded from https://journals.asm.org/journal/mbio on 14 April 2022 by 146.164.21.7. effect exhibited by C. albicans EVs. Supporting this hypothesis, C. albicans 10231 EVs retained the ability to inhibit ﬁlamentation despite the absence of FOH. These results also suggest that other lipids besides FOH might mediate the ﬁlamentation inhibition inC. albicans , a premise also supported by the fact that FOH has not been found in EVs from H. capsulatum and S. cerevisiae . DHFOH, geranylgeraniol, and dihydrogeranylgera- niol were the additional terpenes detected in high concentrations in C. albicans 90228 EVs. The fact that DHFOH was the only terpene exhibiting a similar activity to FOH indi- cates that this molecule may contribute signi ﬁcantly to the inhibitory effect mediated by EVs released from C. albicans strain 90028. The biological activity of DHFOH has been previously reported in in vitro studies that demonstrated that volatile compounds produced by C. albicans , including DHFOH, inhibited the growth of dermatophytes (62). Taken together, our and previous functional and analytical data suggest that acombination of lipid species could mediate the inhibitory activity in C. albicans . As mentioned above, our GC-MS data also revealed the presence of different fatty acids species in fungal EVs, including C have demonstrated that long-chain fatty acids have no effect on C. albicans differentia- tion, including octadecanoic and octadecenoic acids (24), major components in C. albi- cans EVs. Nevertheless, butyric acid, a short-chain fatty acid generated by lactic acid- producing bacteria, inhibits C. albicans germination by 40 and 98% when used at 25 and 100 mM, respectively. Recent studies suggest that the biological activity of fatty acids in C. albicans could be related to their chain length. Murzyn and colleagues (63) have shown that puri ﬁed C10:0inhibited C. albicans ﬁlamentation and reduced its capacity to adhere and form bio ﬁlm. Willems and colleagues (64) have con ﬁrmed the inhibitory activities of C10:0incorporated in lipid emulsions. Notably, in both studies, C10:0did not suppress yeast growth. The effect of C14:0onC. albicans ﬁlamentation, bio- ﬁlm formation, and virulence has recently been investigated by Prasath and colleagues (23). According to these authors, C14:0blocked yeast-to-hypha differentiation and bio- ﬁlm formation without compromising fungal viability. In addition, treatment with this fatty acid impacted ergosterol synthesis, sphingolipid metabolism, multidrug resist- ance, and oxidative stress. The effect of medium-chain fatty acids over C. albicans was investigated by Lee and colleagues (22), and they showed that C7:0,C8:0,C9:0,C10:0,C11:0, and C12:0negatively affected bio ﬁlm formation and ﬁlamentation in C. albicans .", "Remarkably, C14:0was enriched in fungal EVs released by strain 10231, and C12:0was found in high concentrations in EVs from S. cerevisiae and H. capsulatum , suggesting that the inhibitory effect mediated by these EVs was at least in part due to these lipids. Moreover, treatment with C7:0and C9:0modi ﬁed the expression of bio ﬁlm and hyphal growth-regulating genes in a similar fashion to FOH, suggesting that they share the same regulatory mechanism. However, in the same study, the authors stated that cAMP did not reverse the inhibitory effect of fatty acids, which indicated that other sig- naling pathways related to hyphal development could be impacted. Our experiments showed that if C. albicans yeasts were treated with C. albicans 90028 EVs and then db- cAMP was added to the wells, a signi ﬁcant reversion of effect was observed. However, the ability of db-cAMP to reverse the EVs effect was reduced when db-cAMP and EVswere preincubated before addition to the culture. These results strongly indicate that EVs are able to inactivate the db-cAMP. Although this last condition is not expected to occur in vivo , it shows that fungal EVs have different ways to impact the extracellular environment.", "It has been speculated that the reduced size and round shape of yeast cells make them the putative forms used by C. albicans to disseminate in the host. However, this possibility is questionable due to the presence of serum in the blood, which would promptly induce germ tube and hypha formation (57). Our experiments showed that C. albicans EVs inhibited yeast-to-hypha transition even in the presence of fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 5% CO", "2atmosphere, indicating that morphogenesis could be con-", "trolled by EVs during various phases of infection.

This possibility is reinforced by the fact that there was a delay dur- ingﬁlamentation in the edge of colonies formed by C. albicans EV-treated yeast cells during agar-penetrating growth tests. To correlate the inhibitory effect of C. albicans EVs with the decrease in fungal invasion and virulence, we have investigated the abilityof pretreated yeast cells to kill G. mellonella larvae. Indeed, C. albicans EV treatment sig- niﬁcantly attenuated the ability of C. albicans to cause larvae death. Melanization was only observed in larvae infected with untreated yeasts, con ﬁrming stress due to inva- sive candidiasis. This result indicated that by inhibiting yeast-to-hypha differentiation,C. albicans EVs decreased fungal virulence. Similar results have been observed when C. albicans was treated with the middle-chain fatty acid C 9:0using Caenorhabditis elegans as a model (23). In addition, this validates the idea that controlling ﬁlamentation would be a potential approach as a therapeutic strategy (65).", "In conclusion, our results support recent ﬁndings showing that fungal EVs can be used as messaging compartments and directly in ﬂuence bio ﬁlm production and mor- phogenesis. In addition, our study presents the ﬁne structural characterization of previ- ously unknown lipid components. EVs could stabilize the lipids and reduce their sus-ceptibility to being oxidized, a function already suggested for liposomes. We havecharacterized the major players mediating C. albicans yeast-to-hypha differentiation, and further studies are necessary to determine whether these identi ﬁed lipids in com- bination could be used to control candidiasis in vivo .", "MATERIALS AND METHODS Microorganisms and culture conditions. C. albicans ATCC strains 90028, 10231, and SC5314 and theS. cerevisiae strain RSY225 were cultivated in Sabouraud at 30°C under agitation (150 rpm) for 48 h. H. capsulatum strain G-217B (ATCC 26032) was cultivated in Histoplasma -macrophage medium (HMM) at 37°C under agitation (180 rpm). C. albicans yeast cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) 3 times, enumerated, and then transferred to medium 199 (M199), pH 4.0 or pH 7.0, RPMI-MOPS (morpholinepropanesulfonic acid) 0.165 M, or RPMI supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS)according to the experiments described below. Isolation and quanti ﬁcation of EVs. EVs were isolated following protocols developed by our group (31) with minor adjustments. Brie ﬂy, yeast cultures (1 L) from each fungal species were collected after 48 h of growth as described above. Cells and debris were removed by sequential centrifugation steps(4,000 and 15,000 /C2g, 15 min, 4°C). An additional step of ﬁltration using a 0.45- mm membrane ﬁlter (Merck Millipore) was used to remove any remaining yeast cells or debris. The supernatant was then con-centrated using an Amicon ultra ﬁltration system (100-kDa cutoff; Millipore) to a ﬁnal volume of approxi- mately 20 mL. EVs were collected by centrifugation at 100,000 /C2gfor 1 h at 4°C. Supernatant was dis- carded, and the pellet enriched in EVs was washed twice with PBS, pH 7.4, at 100,000 /C2gfor 1 h at 4°C. Alternatively, 300 mL containing 107C. albicans yeast cells was plated onto petri dishes containing Sabouraud dextrose agar (SDA). After 24 h of growth, yeast cells were harvested using a cell scraper andtransferred to 20 mL of PBS. Cells and debris were removed as described above, the supernatant was ﬁl- tered using a 0.45- mm membrane ﬁlter, and the EVs were collected by centrifugation at 100,000 /C2gfor 1 h at 4°C. To isolate EVs from macrophages (RAW 264.7 macrophage-like; ATCC TIB-71) culture mediumRPMI supplemented with 10% FBS (400 mL), FBS was ultracentrifuged to remove vesicles present, with70% cellular con ﬂuence, and was collected after 24 h and centrifuged (300 /C2gand 15,000 /C2g, 15 min, 4°C). The same steps of ﬁltration were used, and the EVs were recovered after centrifugation at The presence of EVs was con ﬁrmed using dynamic light scattering (DLS) analysis (31) and nanopar- ticle tracking analysis (NTA) (46). EVs were suspended in 200 mL PBS, and aliquots of 5 to 10 mL were used to perform the sterol quanti ﬁcation. Sterol content was determined using the quantitative ﬂuoro- metric kit Amplex red sterol assay kit (Molecular Probes, Life Technologies). Protein content was meas- ured using the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) kit (Pierce, Thermo Fisher Scienti ﬁc). Additionally, aliquots of 5 to 10mL were also plated onto Sabouraud agar plates to con ﬁrm that the preparation was sterile. NTA of C. albicans EVs. Nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) of fungal EVs was performed on an LM10 nanoparticle analysis system, coupled with a 488-nm laser and equipped with a scienti ﬁc comple- mentary metal oxide semiconductor (SCMOS) camera and a syringe pump (Malvern Panalytical, Malvern, UK) following the conditions used by Reis and colleagues (46). All samples were 833- to 2,500-folddiluted in ﬁltered PBS and measured within the optimal dilution range of 9 /C210", "7to 2.9/C2109particles/", "mL. Samples were injected using a syringe pump speed of 50, and three videos of 60 s were capturedper sample, with the camera level set to 15, gain set to 3, and viscosity set to that of water (0.954 toPopulational Functions of Fungal EVs mBio Month YYYY Volume XX Issue XX 10.1128/mbio.00301-22 16 Downloaded from https://journals.asm.org/journal/mbio on 14 April 2022 by 146.164.21.7. for all samples. Levels of blur and maximum jump distance were automatically set. The data wereacquired and analyzed using the NTA 3.0 software (Malvern Panalytical). Bioﬁlm assays. For bio ﬁlm production and quanti ﬁcation, two protocols were used. First, yeast cells were plated onto polystyrene 96-well plates containing M199 (10", "5cells/well) in the presence of different", "concentrations of EVs (0.5, 1, and 5 mg/mL based on sterol content). Second, yeasts were plated onto polystyrene 96-well plates containing M199 (105cells/well), and the systems were incubated for 90 min. Then, the nonadherent cells were removed by washing with PBS, and fresh M199 was added containingdifferent concentrations of EVs (0.5, 1, and 5 mg/mL based on sterol content). For both protocols, PBS was used as negative control. Bio ﬁlm was allowed to develop for 24 and 48 h at 37°C and then quanti- ﬁed by the crystal violet method. Brie ﬂy, after each time point, the bio ﬁlm-coated wells were washed 3 times with PBS, air-dried for 45 min, and stained with 0.4% aqueous crystal violet (100 mL) for 10 min and washed 3 times with 200 mL of PBS. Then, 100 mL of absolute ethanol was added to the wells, and the systems were incubated for 5 min. The plate was then analyzed using a microplate reader (EL808;BioTek) at the wavelength of 540 nm (66). Tests were performed in triplicate. For scanning electron mi-croscopy, yeast cells were washed three times in PBS, pH 7.2 60.1, to remove planktonic cells and ﬁxed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde type I in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer (pH 7.2 60.1) for 1 h at room tempera- ture. After ﬁxation, cells were washed in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer (pH 7.2 60.1) containing 0.2 M sucrose and 2 mM MgCl", "2. Then, cells were dehydrated in ethanol (30, 50, and 70%, for 5 min and then", "95% and 100% twice for 10 min), subjected to critical point drying in an EM CPD300 (Leica, Wetzlar,Germany), covered with gold sputtering (10 62 nm), and visualized in a Zeiss Auriga 40 (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) microscope operated at 2 kV.", "Yeast-to-hyphae differentiation. C. albicans yeast cells (2.5 /C210 3/well) were plated onto 96-well plates containing the hypha-inducing medium M199 or RPMI supplemented with 10% FBS. To test whether the number of yeast cells would in ﬂuence the EV activity, different suspensions of C. albicans were used (1.5 /C2103,2/C2104, and 3.5 /C2104yeast cells/well). Fungal EVs were added at ﬁnal concentra- tions varying from 0.025 to 5 mg/mL (based on sterol content). For the lipid extracts, activity tests ali- quots of 10 mL (equivalent to 5 mg/mL of EVs) were added to the wells. The puri ﬁed terpenes DHFOH (Penta, USA) and geranylgeraniol (Sigma-Aldrich, USA), solubilized in 1 mL of ethanol, and ascorbic acid2,6-dihexadecanoate (TCI America, USA), dissolved in 1 mL of acetone, were added to the wells in differ-ent concentrations (please see the ﬁgure legends). Plates were incubated at 37°C and 5% CO and 24 h. For each time interval, the cells ’morphologies were visualized under an Observer Z1 micro- scope (Carl Zeiss International, Germany), and the images were collected and processed with ImageJ(NIH, US) and Photoshop (Adobe). Time-lapse video microscopies were performed after plating yeastcells of C. albicans strain 90028 (5 /C210", "3yeast cells/well) onto 4-well plates containing 1 mL of M199 me-", "dium. A ﬁnal concentration of 5 mg/mL of C. albicans EVs was added to the wells. PBS was used as con- trol. Samples were placed in a culture chamber with controlled temperature and CO2environment (37°C and 5%, respectively) and attached to a Nikon Eclipse TE300 (Nikon, USA). Phase-contrast images werecaptured every minute using a Hamamatsu C2400 charge-coupled-device (CCD) camera (Hamamatsu,Japan) connected with a Scion FG7 frame grabber (Scion Corporation, USA). Time-lapse images were taken every 1 min using a Nikon Eclipse TE300 microscope attached to a digital Hamamatsu C11440-10C camera (Hamamatsu, Japan). Movie animations were generated using ImageJ v1.8 software (NIH, US). EV lipid extraction. An aliquot containing 50 mg/mL of EVs was dried using a SpeedVac vacuum concentrator (Eppendorf), followed by lipid extraction with chloroform (C)/methanol (M)/water (W)(8:4:3 [vol/vol/vol]) according to Nimrichter et al. (67). The pellet containing nonextractable residues and precipitated protein was recovered by centrifugation. Partition was obtained after water addition to the system to reach the proportion C/M/W (8:4:5.6 [vol/vol/vol]). The upper and lower phases and the pro-tein content were dried separately using SpeedVac, suspended in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), and theiractivity tested as described below. The lower (LPs) and upper phases (UPs) contain lipids with higherand lower polarity, respectively. The interphase was also dried using SpeedVac and suspended in DMSO.Aliquots of each fraction (pellet and lower and upper phases) equivalent to 5 mg/mL (based on sterol content) of EVs according to previous quanti ﬁcation were tested. The same protocol was used to sepa- rate the nonpolar components of Sabouraud medium, and the lower phase was used as control. Thermostability of EV activity. To investigate the thermostability of the C. albicans 90028 yeast EV ac- tivity, the samples were heated for 15 min at 90°C. Then, a ﬁnal concentration corresponding to 5 mg/mL (based on sterol content before heat treatment) of EVs was tested as described above. Long-term effect of EVs. C. albicans yeast cells (2.5 /C2103/well) were plated onto 96-well plates con- taining M199 and treated with 5 mg/mL (based on sterol content) of EVs. The cell morphology of C. albi- cans was analyzed using an Observer Z1 microscope (Carl Zeiss International, Germany) after 4, 8, and 3/well were transferred to fresh M199 in the absence of EVs. These steps were repeated four times without addition of EVs to the cul-tures. Untreated yeast cells cultivated in M199 were used as control every 24 h. These steps wererepeated four times. Hyphae-to-yeast differentiation. Yeast cells of C. albicans (2.5/C210 3/well) were plated onto 96-well plates containing M199 media and then incubated for 4 h to allow yeast-to-hypha differentiation. Afterthis period, 100% of the yeast cells differentiated to hyphae. Then, a ﬁnal concentration of EVs (5 mg/mL, based on sterol content), EVs (5 mg/mL), FOH (80, 8 and 0.8 mM), and DHFOH (80, 8 and 0.8 mM) were added to the wells and the morphology accompanied for additional 4, 8, and 24 h as described above.PBS was used as control.

Yeast cells of C. albicans (2.5/C2103/well) were plated onto 96-well plates containing M199 and treated with 5 mg/mL (based on sterol content) of C. albicans 90028 EVs preincubated with the cAMP donor db-cAMP (10 mM) (Sigma-Aldrich) for 1 h. Alternatively, yeasts were treated with C. albicans 90028 EVs for 1 h, and then db-cAMP (10 mM) was added to the wells. Cell morphology was analyzed using an Observer Z1 microscope (Carl Zeiss International,Germany) after 4, 8, and 24 h. Yeast lipid extraction. Yeast of C. albicans ,H. capsulatum , and S. cerevisiae (6/C210", "10cells) was sus-", "pended in a mixture of C/M (2:1 [vol/vol]), stirred for 16 h at room temperature, and then clari ﬁed by centrifugation. Cells were extracted with a mixture of C and M (1:2 [vol/vol]) under the same conditions. Lipid extracts were combined and dried using a rotavapor (Heidolph, Germany). The lipids were then suspended in a mixture of C/M/W (8:4:5.6 [vol/vol]) and vigorously mixed. The lower phase was driedusing a rotavapor and suspended in 2.5 mL of chloroform. Aliquots were dried using Vacufuge Plus vac-uum concentrator (Eppendorf, Germany) and suspended in DMSO. A yeast-to-hypha differentiationassay was performed to determine the minimal amount of the lower phase from C. albicans (20, 4, 2, 1, 0.5, 0.25, 0.125, and 0.05 mg/mL) was able to block the differentiation.", "Size exclusion chromatography. To exclude the presence of free-contaminants in EV preparations, we used size exclusion chromatography (SEC) according to Menezes-Neto and colleagues (68) with minoradjustments. Brie ﬂy, Sepharose 4B ( ﬁnal volume of 10 mL) was packed in a 10-mL syringe and then equili- brated with PBS-citrate 0.36% (wt/vol). The EVs obtained after ultracentrifugation were suspended in a ﬁnal volume of 500 mL and applied to the column. A total of 30 fractions of 500 mL were collected immediately after column loading using PBS-citrate as eluant. EVs aliquots of 5 to 10 mL were used to perform the sterol and protein quanti ﬁcation as described previously. A yeast-to-hypha differentiation assay was performed to determine the activity of each fraction. To avoid additional steps to concentrate the samples, the lipids from each fraction were extracted as described above and the LP normalized according to the sterol content. A ﬁnal concentration of 5 mg/mL of sterol was used. For the fractions where sterol was not detected, 400 mLo f each fraction was used for lipid extraction and solvent partition. The LP was dried down in a SpeedVac andsuspended in 2 mLo fD M S O .A na l i q u o to f1 mL was used to test the inhibitory activity.", "Reverse-phase thin-layer chromatography. EVs or LP lipids were suspended in C/M (1:1 [vol/vol]), and their concentration was normalized by sterol content or the total weight, respectively. Aliquots of 10 mL were spotted into reverse-phase TLC (RP-TLC) plates (silica gel 60 RP-18 F254s; 1 mm; Merck, Germany). The plates were developed in chambers presaturated for 10 min using acetone as a solvent system. After devel-opment, plates were dried at room temperature, and the bands were visualized after spraying with a solutionof 50 mg ferric chloride (FeCl 3) in a mixture of 90 mL water, 5 mL acetic acid, and 5 mL sulfuric acid (69).", "After spraying, plates were heated at 100°C for 3 to 5 min. FOH was used as standard. Under these condi-tions, FOH appears as a purple band. Alternatively, the developed plates were incubated in a saturated io-dine chamber where the lipids appear as yellow bands. The bands were scraped from the TLC and placedinto microcentrifuge tubes. Lipids were suspended in C/M (1:1 [vol/vol]) and ﬁltered using a polyvinylidene diﬂuoride (PVDF) membrane with 0.22 mm to a new microcentrifuge tube. Samples were dried down using a SpeedVac, suspended in DMSO, and normalized by lipid weight. For the lipid activity tests, aliquots of 10 mL (equivalent to 5 mg/mL of EVs) were added to the wells containing yeasts of C. albicans in M199 medium. Plates were incubated at 37°C and 5% CO2for 4, 8, and 24 h.

FOH extraction. The C. albicans yeast 90028 and 10231 EV samples (19.1 mg total sterol) were resus- pended in 400 mL methanol (high-performance liquid chromatography [HPLC] grade; Fisher Scienti ﬁc), vor- texed for 2 min, and centrifuged for 15 min at 14,000 /C2gat room temperature. The supernatants were transferred to a 2-mL polytetra ﬂuoroethylene (PTFE)-lined cap glass tube (Supelco; catalog no. 27134; Sigma-Aldrich). The ensuing pellet was redissolved in 400 mL methanol, and the previous steps were repeated. The two resulting supernatants were pooled and dried under nitrogen gas in Supelco PTFE-linedcap glass vials. For FOH extraction, the yeast C. albicans yeast 90028 and 10231 EV samples were partitioned by adding 500 mL HPLC-grade water (Fisher Scienti ﬁc) and 500 mL ethyl acetate (Sigma-Aldrich; catalog no. 270989) and vortexed for 2 min. After phase separation, the upper (organic) phase was collected, trans- ferred to a fresh PTFE-lined cap glass vial, and dried under nitrogen gas. Samples were then redissolved in20 mL methylene chloride (Optima grade, Fisher Scienti ﬁc), transferred to Verex PTFE-lined/silicone cap vials (Phenomenex; mVial i3 [Qsert]) just prior to gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis. Lipid analysis by GC-MS. A standard of FOH isomer mixture (catalog no. 93547; Supelco, Sigma- Aldrich) was diluted in methylene chloride (Optima grade, Fisher Scienti ﬁc) to a concentration of 22.5 pmol/ mL to determine the transition ions to be used in the selected-reaction monitoring (SRM) method. Chromatographic separation was performed by injecting 1 mL of FOH standard onto a Thermo TSQ 9000 triple-quadrupole GC-MS/MS system (Thermo Fisher Scienti ﬁc) set to splitless, MS transfer line at 250°C, with an AI/AS 1310 series autosampler (Thermo Fisher Scienti ﬁc), equipped with a Zebron (ZB-FFAP; 30-m by 0.32-mm by 0.25- mm) column, previously indicated for separation of FOH isomers (51). Isomers were separated by maintaining a loading temperature of 40°C for 1.2 min, followed by a heat gradientto 250°C at a rate of 20°C/min, and a plateau held at 250°C until the end of the run at 13.5 min.Additionally, ramped pressure was applied throughout the run, beginning with 89 kPa held for 2 min, and increased to 150 kPa over 6.1 min, while holding at 150 kPa until the end of the run. Initially, a full scan was run to determine the retention time (RT) and underivatized FOH limits of detection prior toFOH SRM con ﬁrmation and full scan analysis.

However, subsequent analyses were per- formed with a concentration of FOH standard of 4.5 pmol/ mL, in which the detection of all four isomers (Z, Z, Z,E, E,Z, and E,E) of FOH was reproducible, and the signal of the least abundant isomer (Z,Z) was at least;10% of the most abundant (E,E) isomer and ;6-fold higher than the background. Using the AutoSRM mode on the TSQ 9000 GC-MS dashboard feature, the ion fragmentation was optimized at their respective RT with the top three transition ions (81.1 to 79.1 at 8 collision energy [CE], 69.1 to 41 at 6 CE, and 41.1 to EVs were transferred from Chromeleon v7.2.9 into PowerPoint for ﬁgure generation.", "Quantitative analysis of FOH or FOH-like molecules by GC-MS.

Além disso, a morfogênese é essencial durante a formação do biofilme e desenvolvimento da doença (TSUI; KONG; JABRA -RIZK, 2016) . Um ponto chave é que a inibição da mudança morfológica tem sido estudada como um alvo terapêutico de grande relevância para can didíase (SHARECK; BELHUMEUR, 2011) . Outro campo de estudo para novas estratégias no combate à candidíase são o das m oléculas ambientais e auto reguladoras envolvidas com a morfogênese em C. albicans têm sido extensivamente investigadas (OH et al., 2001; KRUPPA, 2009; ALBUQUERQUE; CASADEVALL, 2012) .", "Contudo , as molé culas de C. albicans que interferem na morfologia de C. albicans é muito limitado, bem como os mecanismos pelos quais esses compostos são liberados para o meio extracelular. Farnesol e tirosol são exemplos destas moléculas , denominadas moléculas de quorum sense (MQS) estas são produzid as por C. albicans participando na regula ção da morfogênese e na formação de biofilme (RODRIGUES; ČERNÁKOVÁ, 2020) .", "Levando em co nta que as VEs fúngic as têm sido apontadas como participantes de destaque na comunicação célula -célula e na produção de matriz de biofilme em C. albicans (BITENCOURT et al., 2022; ZARNOWSKI et al., 2022) , levantamos a hipótese de que esses compartimentos poderiam estar envolvidos com a formação de bio filme e morfogênese de C. albicans . Os resultados aqui apresentados apontam que VEs liberadas por leveduras de C. albicans são capazes de afetar o crescimento de leveduras e inibir a formação de biofilmes, através do bloqueio da morfogênese. O impacto d as VEs produzidas pela cepa ATCC 90028 foi investigado durante a formação do biofilme. A incubação simultânea de VEs com células de levedura de C. albicans induziu um crescimento mais rápido e tivemos a sugestão de que as VEs mimetizam parcialmente o efeito do farnesol, exibindo uma atividade inibitória da filamentação e da formação de biofilme de maneira dose - dependente . No entanto, esse efeito foi prolongado em relação à atividade vista na atividade do farnesol, apontando que a morfogênese da levedura para hifa é interrompida por um tempo maior em relação ao farnesol . O farnesol (E,E-farnesol) tem sido amplamente utilizado em estudos de MQS e é produzido em grandes quantidades por C. albicans .", "Os mecanismos exatos que levam a inibição da morfogênese por par te das VEs para que promovam um efeito tão prolongado não foram investigados, mas visto que a duração da inibição da morfogênese se deu por 72 horas, sugerindo que as alterações sejam epigenéticas. Outro fato observado foi que as células tratadas com VEs não conseguiam se manter aderi das aos poços após a incubação após cerca de 6 horas, sugerindo que o tratamento com VEs alterou a superfície da parede fúngica. Os dados que mostram a necessidade de uma concentração mínima para observar a atividade indicam que os componentes p resentes n as VEs e que são responsáveis pela inibição da morfogênese, um padrão bem similar para as MQS como o farnesol e tirosol (KOVÁCS; MAJOROS, 2020) . Essa hipótese está de acordo com a transiçã o comum entre as formas de levedura e hifa. Em conjunto, esses resultados indicam que as VEs carregam estruturas capazes de regular o crescimento e a morfogênese em C. albicans .", "A fim de investigar se C. albicans usa a exportação de VEs como um mecanismo g eral para regular a morfogênese pelo menos in vitro , foram isola das VEs de duas outras cepas de C. albicans e sua capacidade de inibir a diferenciação de levedura para hifa testada. Nossos resultados mostram que três cepas diferentes de C. albicans produze m VEs com propriedades semelhantes tanto quan do se usa as VEs em C. albicans ATCC90028 ou em ATCC10231. Quanto a os aspectos físicos, fora visualizadas pequenas diferenças de tamanho entre as diferentes VEs de C. albicans , confirmando dados publicados por nosso grupo mostrando que cepas de C. albicans podem produzir VEs com tamanhos distintos (VARGAS et al., 2015) . Contudo, o processo de diferenciação de todas as cep as foi afetado pelos VEs e de forma cruzada. As d iferenças morfológicas de VEs geralmente são atribuídas a mudanças na composição e / ou vias de biogênese destas. Por esta razão foram utilizadas cepas com capacidade de filamentação e perfil de virulência d istintos. Os resultados sugerem que a capacidade de inibir a filamentação d as VEs não é da espécie -específica e a correlação entre sua atividade e a virulência de cada cepa irá demandar estudos adicionais. Todavia, o número total, bem como o tamanho das VEs produzidas por cada cepa deve influenciar a atividade global in vivo . Os estudos sobre a produção de VEs durante a infecção in vivo ainda não puderam ser determinad os devido a limitações técnicas. Além disso, os níveis de suscetibilidade à ação das VEs também podem estar relacionad a a expressões de diferentes alvos envolvidos com as atividades de VEs em cada cepa.", "Várias estruturas transportadas por VEs fúngicas já descritas na literatura podem estar envolvidas com o da morfogênese, incluindo lipídios, p roteínas e RNA. A participação de moléculas termolábeis, incluindo várias enzimas presentes nas VEs, como as aspartil proteases secretadas (SAP) (GIL-BONA et al., 2015; VARGAS et al., 2015) , foi descartada, pois a inibição da filamentação se manteve mesmo quando essas VEs foram aquecidas à temperatura de 90°C. De posse desse dados foi infer ido que os lipídios, que são moléculas termoestáveis, poderiam estar participando desse evento como cau sa. Esses resultados suger iram que um composto lipídico poderia ser responsável pela atividade inibitória mediada por VEs.", "Levando em conta que o farnesol é um lipídio com capacidade de regular a morfogênese em C. albicans , especul ou-se se esta molécula p oderia ser carreada pelas VEs e mediar o efeito inibitório visto nos experimentos. Nossos resultados de TLC confirmaram a presença de uma banda na altura d o farnesol com atividade inibitória exclusivamente de lipídios de C. albicans . No entanto, não podemo s descartar que o método colorimétrico usado em nossos experimentos não foi sensível para detectar baixas quantidades de farnesol em cepas de H. capsulatum e S. cerevisiae . Devido a essas limitações foi necessário confirmar se o farnesol estava presente nas VEs de C. albicans em concentrações adequadas para apresentar uma atividade inibitória.", "Os resultados obtidos por GC -MS indicaram fortemente a presença de lipídios em VEs de C. albicans que poderiam interferir na morfogênese, incluindo uma família de ter penos e ácidos graxos de cadeia média (MURZYN et al., 2010; WILLEMS et al., 2019) . Afora o farnesol, outros sesquiterpenos e diterpenos nunca relatados anteriormente em VEs de C. albicans foram os principais compostos caracterizados nestes compartimento s de C. albicans . Um fato interessante é que a proporção de terpenos presentes nas VEs de C. albicans foi diferente d a fração lipídica inferior feita a partir da partição de Folch com o extr ato total das células de levedura . Esses resultados sugerem que durante a biogênese d as VEs existe um enriquecimento específico de espécies derivadas do farnesol. Além disso, diterpenos foram encontrados em quantidades muito baixas em VEs liberados por S. cerevisiae e H. capsulatum , o que poderia explicar por que eles têm uma atividade reduzida para inibir a diferenciação quando comparados às VEs de C. albicans . Por fim , nossos dados de GC-MS também apontaram para a presença de diferentes espécies de ácidos graxos nas VEs de C. albicans . Estudos anteriores demonstraram que os ácidos graxos de cadeia longa não tiveram efeito na diferenciação, incluindo os ácidos octadecanóico e octadecenóico, componentes principais em VEs de C. albicans (JACOBSEN et al., Os estudos sobre a atividade dos ácidos graxos de cadeia média foi investigada recentemente. Willems e col aborad ores (WILLEMS et al., 2019) , mostraram que o ácido decanóico é capaz de inibe a filamentação de C. albicans . Além disso, Lee e col aboradores (LEE et al., 2021) demonstraram que o ácido heptanóico (C7:0), o ácido caprilíco (C8:0), ácido pelargônico (C9:0), ácido cáprico (C10:0), ácido undecanóico (C11:0) e ácido láurico (C12:0) foram capazes de afetar a filamentação e a formação do biofilme em C. albicans . Nesses estudos, os ácidos graxos C7:0 e C9:0 também podem levar a modificaram da expressão de genes reguladores do biofilme e do crescimento de hifas também. Outro efeito observado quando foi feito o pr é-tratamento de C. albicans com C7:0, C9:0, houve uma redução da virulência deste fungo em um modelo de candidíase (LEE et al., 2021) . Os resultados apresentados aqui indicam que o farnesol não é a única molécula t ransportada por VEs que pode regular a morfogênese de C. albicans . Nossos resultados demonstram que as VEs podem reverter a formação de hifas mesmo em condições onde a filamentação já havia sido iniciada e que essa reversão não foi observada quando o farne sol foi adicionado às culturas (OH et al., 2001; DEBARBER et al., 2004) . Outro dad o que apoia a hipótese que não é somente o farnesol o responsável pela atividade inibitória das VEs, esta foi capaz de reverter a filamentação mesmo quando induzidos em meio 199 suplementado com tirosol. Vale ressaltar que os estudos publicados mostram um efeito de curta duração para o farnesol e que esse terpeno não se mostrou capaz de modular positivamente o crescimento de leveduras (OH et al., 2001) . Estudos anteriores sugerem que concentrações mais altas de farnesol inibem completamente o crescimento de C. albicans (SHIRTLIFF et al., 2009) .", "Finalmente, de acordo com os dados obtidos a par tir das análises do GC -MS, a concentração de farnesol transportada pelos VEs parece estar muito abaixo do limite necessário para sua atividade, de acordo com os estudo in vitro . A concentração de farnesol geralmente utilizada em muitos estudos para a inibi ção da diferenciação em C albicans varia substancialmente. Os manuscritos publicados sugerem concentrações que variam entre 1 a 150 M (POLKE et al., 2018; COSTA; SILVA; AMARAL, 2021) . Considerando a menor concentração, de 1 M, a quantidade de farnesol necessária para a inibição da levedura às hifas é de 222,3 ng/mL. De acordo com nossas análises, as VEs de C. albicans carreiam aproximadamente 11,3 ng/ml de farnesol. Em conclusão, nossa sugestão é que as VEs de C. albicans carregam uma vasta diversidade de lipídios, incluindo diterpenos, sesquiterpenos e ácidos graxos que juntos podem esta r controlando as mudanças morfológicas neste organismo. Embora a maior parte dos experimentos realizados em nosso laboratório tenha utilizado o meio M199 como indutor, o efeito das VEs foi também investigado em condições que mimetizam parcialmente situaçõe s in vivo , com a presença de soro fetal bovino e 5% de CO 2. Nossos resultados confirmaram o efeito inibitório mesmo nessas condições experimentais, indicando que a morfogênese pode ser controlada por VEs durante infecções em mamíferos.", "Com base em nos res ultados discutidos acima, levantou -se a possibilidade de que as células de levedura pré -tratadas in vitro com VEs teriam sua capacidade de invadir células hospedeiras e causar doenças reduzidas devido a inibição prolongada da diferenciação. Essa hipótese f oi reforçada pelo fato de que houve um atraso durante a filamentação, visto nas bordas das colônias de C. albicans quando essas leveduras eram tratadas com VEs e posteriormente semeadas em ágar. Para correlacionar o efeito inibitório das VEs com a diminuiç ão da virulência, investigou -se a capacidade das células de levedura pré -tratadas em matar larvas de G. mellonella em uma curva de sobrevivência. E de fato, o tratamento das leveduras de C. albicans com as VEs atenuou significativamente a capacidade do fun go de causar a morte das larvas em nosso modelo. A melanização foi observada apenas nas larvas infectadas com leveduras não tratadas, confirmando o estresse devido a progressão da infecção.

In an attempt to improve the protocols used for EV isolation, we explored a model of vesicle produc-tion after growth of Cryptococcus gattii and Cryptococcus neoformans on solid media. Nanoparticle tracking analysis in combination with transmission electron microscopyrevealed that C. gattiiand C. neoformans produced EVs in solid media. The proper- ties of cryptococcal vesicles varied according to the culture medium used and theEV-producing species. EV detection was reproduced with an acapsular mutant of C. neoformans, as well as with isolates of Candida albicans, Histoplasma capsulatum, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Cryptococcal EVs produced in solid media were bio- logically active and contained regular vesicular components, including the majorpolysaccharide glucuronoxylomannan (GXM) and RNA. Since the protocol had higheryields and was much faster than the regular methods used for the isolation of fun-gal EVs, we asked if it would be applicable to address fundamental questions relatedto cryptococcal secretion. On the basis that polysaccharide export in Cryptococcus requires highly organized membrane trafﬁc culminating with EV release, we ana-lyzed the participation of a putative scramblase (Aim25; CNBG_3981) in EV-mediatedGXM export and capsule formation in C. gattii. EVs from a C. gattii aim25Δ strain dif- fered from those obtained from wild-type (WT) cells in physical-chemical propertiesand cargo. In a model of surface coating of an acapsular cryptococcal strain with ve-sicular GXM, EVs obtained from the aim25Δ mutant were more efﬁciently used as a source of capsular polysaccharides. Lack of the Aim25 scramblase resulted in disor- ganized membranes and increased capsular dimensions. These results associate thedescription of a novel protocol for the isolation of fungal EVs with the identiﬁcationof a previously unknown regulator of polysaccharide release. IMPORTANCE Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are fundamental components of the physi- ology of cells from all kingdoms. In pathogenic fungi, they participate in important mechanisms of transfer of antifungal resistance and virulence, as well as in immunestimulation and prion transmission. However, studies on the functions of fungal EVs are still limited by the lack of efﬁcient methods for isolation of these compartments.In this study, we developed an alternative protocol for isolation of fungal EVs anddemonstrated an application of this new methodology in the study of the physiol-ogy of the fungal pathogen Cryptococcus gattii.

In fungi, these structures were ﬁrst isolated in the human pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans (2).", "EVs have been further described in at least 11 additional species, and their functions in fungi include molecular transport across the cell wall ( 2), induction of drug resistance (3), prion transmission (4, 5), delivery of virulence factors (6, 7), immunological stimu- lation (8–12), RNA export (13), transfer of virulence traits (14), and transkingdom communication followed by regulation of expression of virulence-related genes ( 15).", "Although it is now well recognized that EVs play multiple and essential roles in fungal physiology, many questions remain unanswered ( 16). For instance, it is still unknown what mechanisms are required for biogenesis of EVs. The roles of EVs, if any, during infection also remain indeﬁnite. Finally, as with other infection models, EVs have beenproposed as vaccine candidates to prevent fungal diseases ( 8), but methods for obtaining large amounts of EVs for animal immunization are still not available. Indeed, many of the unsolved questions about fungal EVs remain unanswered because ofexperimental limitations. For instance, it is well known by researchers in the fungal EVﬁeld that the standard protocols used for vesicle isolation are time-consuming (1 to3weeks) and produce very low yields ( 17). It is clear, therefore, that the improvement of protocols for EV isolation might solve major questions in the ﬁeld.", "EVs have been traditionally studied after their isolation from liquid cultures ( 17). However, physiological production of EVs clearly does not demand liquid matrices. For instance, EVs are now considered structural and functional components of the extra-cellular matrix in mammalian models ( 18). In this environment, they participate in matrix organization, regulation of cellular functions, and determination of the physical properties of different tissues ( 19). EVs produced in gelatinous matrices impact tissue regeneration, inﬂammation,andtumorprogression( 18,19).Withafewexceptions(e.g., blood and liquor during infection), fungal cells are distributed over solid or gelatinous matrices,includingthesoil,barkoftrees,birdexcreta,andtissuesofplants,insects,andhigher animals. Nevertheless, the production of fungal EVs in non-liquid matrices hasnot been explored so far, although it is reasonable to suppose that fungal cells mightproduce EVs in non-liquid matrices. Cryptococcus neoformans and Cryptococcus gattii use fungal EVs to export virulence factors and to promote cell-to-cell communication ( 7,14). Noticeably, the Cryptococcus model isoneofthemostlaborioussystemsinwhichfungalEVshavebeenstudied,due to the low yields of the protocols and massive contamination with supernatantpolysaccharides. EV-mediated molecular export in Cryptococcus demands membrane mobility ( 20). In this context, phospholipid ﬂippases and scramblases are essential for membrane curvature and plasticity in different compartments of the cell ( 21). The ﬂippase activity of aminophospholipid transferase 1 (Apt1) was implicated in EV production in C. neoformans (22,23). The role of scramblases, however, remained unknown.", "In thisstudy,wedescribeanovelprotocolforfastandreliableisolationoffungalEVs from solid media, mostly using C. gattii as a model.

To addressthis question, we cultivated C. gattiiorC. neoformans cells to conﬂuence in solid YPD (yeast extract-peptone-dextrose) for 24h, for subsequent preparation of fungal sus-pensions in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) after collection of fungal cells with inoc-ulation loops (see Movie S1 in the supplemental material).

Ultracentrifugation pellets were negatively stained and analyzed bytransmission electron microscopy (TEM), which revealed the presence of vesicularstructures with the typical morphology and dimensions of fungal EVs ( Fig. 1A). The same samples were submitted to nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA), which revealed well-deﬁned peaks corresponding to a major distribution of EVs within the size rangeof 100 to 300nm (Fig. 1B). To analyze the reproducibility of the protocol, EV isolation from C.", "gattiiwas independently repeated four additional times, and vesicle properties were monitored by NTA. All samples produced very similar NTA proﬁles ( Fig. 1C), indicating that the protocol was reproducible. Similar preparations were analyzed by dynamic light scattering, which has been consistently used for the analysis of EVdimensions (17). The proﬁle of size distribution was similar to that obtained by NTA (data not shown).", "We then asked if EV detection in solid media would only occur under speciﬁc experimental conditions. To address this question, we analyzed the production of EVsin a different medium or using distinct fungal species or strains. We ﬁrst checkedwhether C. gattiiand C. neoformans produced EVs in Sabouraud’s medium. Vesicular structures were abundantly detected, but the proﬁle of size distribution included aminorpopulationrangingfrom300to600nminsize( Fig.2AandB).Sincecryptococcal EVs have long been associated with the export of glucuronoxylomannan (GXM) ( 2), we also asked whether EV detection after growth in solid media would be inﬂuenced by the presence of the capsule. We then analyzed vesicles obtained from an acapsularmutant of C. neoformans. As revealed by NTA, the cap67Δ strain of C. neoformans also produced EVs (Fig. 2C). To investigate whether EV detection in solid media is exclusive to the Cryptococcus genus, we analyzed EV samples produced by Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Histoplasma capsulatum, and Candida albicans (Fig. 2D, E, andF). In all cultures tested, NTA revealed particles with properties that were compatible with EVs in size distribution. However, while C. albicans and S. cerevisiae gave nanoparticle signals that were similar to those found in C. neoformans and C. gattii, H. capsulatum producedEVswithamorediversesizedistribution.Together,theseresultsindicatethat EV production in solid media is a general and consistently reproducible phenomenon. RNA and GXM are components of cryptococcal EVs produced in solid media.", "Following the detection of EVs in solid cultures of fungal cells, we asked whether thecryptococcal membrane particles would contain the typical components that werepreviously described in fungal samples of EVs ( 2,13). Since different RNA classes were previously characterized as components of EVs produced by C. neoformans, Malassezia sympodialis, Paracoccidioides brasiliensis, C. albicans, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae (13, 24), we investigated whether these nucleic acids were present in vesicle samples obtained from solid cultures of C. gattiiand C. neoformans. Bioanalyzer analysis re- vealed the presence of RNA in EVs produced by both species ( Fig. 3). The RNA pattern was similar to that observed for other eukaryotes, and most of the RNA was composed of molecules smaller than 200nucleotides (nt), with a peak around 20 to 25nt. The proﬁles of RNA detection were similar in both species ( Fig. 3A).", "GXM is another major component of cryptococcal EVs ( 2). We then analyzed C.", "neoformans and C.", "gattiisamples for the presence of this polysaccharide by enzyme- linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). EVs were disrupted by treatment with organicsolvents, and GXM-containing precipitates were tested for reactivity with a monoclonalantibody to GXM (MAb 18B7), which conﬁrmed the presence of the polysaccharide(Fig. 3B). The results differed in C. neoformans and C. gattii, with the latter showing aRapid Analysis of Fungal Vesicles March/April 2019 Volume 4 Issue 2 e00080-19 msphere.asm.org 3 on May 11, 2019 by guest http://msphere.asm.org/ Downloaded from signiﬁcantly smaller amount of vesicular GXM.

On the basis of the role of eukaryotic scramblases inmembrane trafﬁc and secretion ( 21), we selected a putative scramblase that had been previously suggested in the C. gattiimodel as a regulator of secretion and target for antifungals ( 25) as a possible regulator of EV formation and/or polysaccharide release.

The mutant had normal proliferation rates (not shown) and produced EVs in solid medium ( Fig. 5A). The amounts of EVs produced by mutant cells tended to be smaller, but no statistical signiﬁcance was observed (data not shown). Deletion of AIM25, however, resulted in the production of a population of EVs of larger dimensions,incomparisontovesiclesproducedbywild-type C. gattii(Fig.5B).Vesicular components were also affected in the aim25Δ mutant, as concluded from the altered proﬁle of RNA detection in mutant EVs ( Fig. 5C).", "The differencesinEVdimensionsandcargoweresuggestiveofaroleoftheputative scramblase in membrane organization and/or EV biogenesis.

These results were consistent with the primary roles played by scramblases in the membrane organization of other eukaryotic cells ( 21).", "Polysaccharide export in Cryptococcus relies on membrane mobility and vesicular trafﬁc (2,20). Therefore, we quantiﬁed GXM in crude supernatant samples and EV fractions obtained from wild-type and mutant cells of C. gattii. In comparison with parental cells, the concentration of GXM was much higher in the supernatants of theaim25Δ mutant strain ( Fig. 7A).

This result agrees with a more efﬁcient extraction of GXM from vesicles obtained by fungal cells lacking AIM25.", "Since GXM export in EVs and increased concentration of capsular polysaccharides in supernatants were linked to capsular enlargement ( 2), we asked if the aim25Δ mutant was more efﬁcient in producing large capsules than wild-type cells of C. gattii. Wild- type and mutant cells had their capsular morphology ﬁrst analyzed by India ink counterstaining, and the results suggested that deletion of AIM25led to increased capsular dimensions (data not shown). For a more detailed analysis of the dimensionsand morphology of capsule ﬁbers, scanning electron microscopy was performed. Weﬁrst analyzed fungal cells under the conditions of EV isolation. Growth in YPD inhibitscapsule formation ( 26), and as expected, capsular dimensions were reduced in both wild-type and aim25Δ mutant cells cultivated in the solid medium (Fig. 8). A closer analysis of fungal cells, however, indicated that capsule ﬁbers, although small in dimension, were more abundant in mutant cells grown in YPD ( Fig. 8AtoD).

This approach in fact resulted in fungal cells with larger capsules ( Fig. 8EtoG). Under these conditions, yeast cells with more exuberantcapsuleswereapparentlymorefrequentlyobservedin aim25Δmutant populations. To conﬁrm the visual perception that capsule enlargement was facilitated in mutant cells, we quantiﬁed the average capsular dimensions under conditions ofcapsulerepression(YPD)andinduction(RPMI)( Fig.9).Despitetheincreasednumberof capsular ﬁbers in mutant cells, no differences in capsular dimensions were observed after growth of C. gattiiin YPD. Capsule induction in RPMI, however, was signiﬁcantly more efﬁcient in mutant cells. Together, these results indicate that deletion of AIM25 resulted in a more efﬁcient extracellular release of GXM, resulting in facilitated capsuleenlargement. DISCUSSION Several aspects of the biology of fungal EVs remain to be elucidated (16), and the reduced knowledge on the characteristics of fungal EVs is likely a consequence of inefﬁcient protocols, which usually involve centrifugation of liters of cultures, massivelossofbiologicallyactivesamples,andverylowyields( 17).Fungalpathogensarerarely found in liquid matrices. Except for the cases of fungemia and liquor contamination, pathogenic fungi are usually colonizing tissues, mucosae, and the extracellular matrixduring infection ( 27). In the environment, fungal species with pathogenic potential to humans and animals are usually distributed into the soil, tree shelves, and animal excreta (27). In this context, we hypothesized that fungal EVs could be produced in solid matrices. Besides the biological aspects of EV production in solid media, isolation of vesicle preparations would be facilitated by easier control of both area and volume FIG 6Transmissionelectronmicroscopyofwild-type(WT)andmutant(aim25Δ)cellsof C. gattii.WTcells manifested the typical intracellular morphology of cryptococci, including well-deﬁned vacuoles (V) and organizedmembranouscompartments.Inmutantcells,distortedmembraneswereabundantlydetected.Phenotypic traits that were exclusive to mutant cells included a general lack of the typical cryptococcalvacuoles, highly-electron-dense membranous compartments (orange arrowhead), linearized membranes(white arrowheads), electron-dense, stacked membranes (blue arrowhead), and atypical invaginations ofthe plasma membrane (yellow arrowheads).

EVs isolated from solid media were shown to be biologically active and to contain at least some of the typical components of EVs, as concluded from exper-iments demonstrating the trafﬁc of GXM and presence of RNA, respectively. Traditional protocols of EV isolation from cryptococcal cultures usually include massive GXM contamination ( 17). However, it is still premature to afﬁrm that this issue was resolved with the current protocol, since the culture conditions used in this study for EV isolation from solid media are known to inhibit GXM secretion and capsuleformation ( 26). Importantly, while the protocols available for isolation of fungal EVs could take up to weeks and include numerous rounds of supernatant concentration and ultracentrifugation ( 17), the proposed protocol took approximately 5h from col- lection of extracellular components to NTA analysis without any additional cost. We also showed that the facilitated protocol for EV isolation was applicable to addressimportant biological questions related to fungal export. For example, our study com-pared for the ﬁrst time the properties of EVs produced by C. neoformans and C. gattii, which revealed important differences in polysaccharide content.", "We extended the currently described approach to the study of potential regulators of EV-mediated export. Scramblases and ﬂippases are different types of enzymaticgroups of phospholipid transportation enzymes ( 21). It is reasonable to suppose that regulators of membrane architecture are required for proper EV release. Indeed, in C.", "neoformans, the Apt1 ﬂippase regulated EV physical properties and GXM export ( 22, 23). The participation of other membrane regulators remained unexplored, as well as the roleofphospholipidtranslocatorsinthe C. gattiimodel.Inthiscontext,weselected a putative scramblase (Aim25) as a potential regulator of membrane architecture andEV formation in the C. gattiimodel. Both WT and aim25Δ mutant cells lacking the gene putatively encoding the C. gattii scramblase produced EVs. Based on the detection of a population of larger EVs incultures of mutant cells, we hypothesized that scramblase was required for membraneorganization, proper EV formation, and extracellular cargo release from fungal cells.Membrane organization and proper EV formation were in fact affected in aim25Δ FIG 9Analysis of cellular area as a consequence of capsular dimensions in wild-type (WT) and mutant (aim25Δ) cells of C. gattiiafter growth in solid YPD (capsule repression) or incubation in RPMI (capsule induction).Themostrepresentativephenotypesobservedundereachexperimentalconditionareshown on the bottom as scanning electron microscopy images. Differences in capsular dimensions had nostatistical signiﬁcance, with the exception of the comparison between WT and mutant cells afterincubation in RPMI.

EV cargo was likely impacted in mutant cells, as concluded from the altered proﬁle of RNA detection in mutantvesicles. Unexpectedly, the GXM concentration was highly increased in whole super-natants of aim25Δ mutant cells. We therefore hypothesized that the altered membrane organization of mutant cells could result in a more efﬁcient release of GXM from EVs.If this hypothesis was valid, a more efﬁcient capsule formation would be expected inaim25Δmutantcells.Ourresultsdemonstratedthat cap67Δacapsularcellswereindeed more efﬁcient in taking up GXM from EVs produced by the aim25Δ mutant. In fact, these scramblase mutant cells had more exuberant capsules. These results contradictthe notion that deletion of membrane regulators will negatively impact GXM exportand capsule formation and efﬁciently illustrate the complexity of the physiologicalfunctions of EV-mediated molecular export. The pathogenic potential of the aim25Δ mutant still needs to be addressed, but the impact of scramblase deletion in Cryptococcus is likely broader. For instance, mutant cells of C. neoformans lacking ﬂippase expression had aberrant Golgi structure, atten- uated synthesis of phospholipids, increased production of immunogenic sterols, andreduced formation of virulence-related lipids ( 22,23). Flippase and scramblase func- tions, however, are not necessarily related. In contrast to our current observations, ﬂippase mutants had decreased GXM synthesis and reduced capsular dimensions ( 22). Our present results describe a novel, simpliﬁed protocol of EV isolation and its application to reveal functions of a previously unknown regulator (Aim25 scramblase)of EV properties in Cryptococcus. The impact of the use of the new approach to study fungal EVs will be revealed in the future, but considering the well-known difﬁculties inthe ﬁeld, it is expected that the protocol will be useful not only to identify otherregulators of EV formation, but also to address the immunological functions of fungalEVs and to develop new alternatives to the study of their biogenesis and composition.The potential of this methodology to investigate EV formation in different fungalspecies and morphological stages is also foreseeable. MATERIALS AND METHODS Fungal strains. The EV-producing isolates used in this study included the standard strains H99 of C. neoformans and R265 of C. gattii(2,14),C. albicans strain ATCC 90028 (8), S. cerevisiae strain RSY113 (28), and H.", "capsulatum strain G217B (29). The cap67Δ acapsular mutant of C. neoformans was used for glycan incorporation assays (30). The Delsgate methodology was used to construct the aim25Δ mutant strain lacking scramblase expression in the C. gattii background (CNBG_3981 in C. gattii R265; ortholog CNAG_07164 in C. neoformans H99). Two fragments (/H110111,000bp) encompassing the 5= and 3=ﬂanking sequences of the CNBG_3981 locus were PCR ampliﬁed and gel puriﬁed using the PureLink Quick Gel extractionandPCRpuriﬁcationcombokit(Invitrogen).Bothfragmentsweremixed(100ngofeach)withpDONR-NAT vector (/H11011200ng), as previously described ( 31), and submitted to BP clonase reaction according to manufacturer’s instructions (Invitrogen). The cassette was transformed in Escherichia coli OmniMAX cells and selected by antibiotic resistance screening and colony PCR. Biolistic transformationwas performed to introduce the deletion construct previously linearized by I-SceI enzymatic digestion inC. gattii, as previously described ( 31). The screening was performed using nourseothricin resistance and colony PCR. The mutant strain was conﬁrmed by semiquantitative reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) usingactintranscriptsasaloadingcontrol,accordingtoprotocolspreviouslyused( 31).Theprimersused are listed in Table 1.

Washed", "cells were adhered to coverslips that were previously coated with 0.01% poly- L-lysine (Sigma- Aldrich) for 20min. Adhered cells were gradually dehydrated in ethanol (30, 50, and 70% for 5minand then 95% and 100% twice for 10min). The samples were critical point dried (Leica EM CPD300)immediately after dehydration, mounted on metallic bases (stubs), coated with a gold layer of 15-to 20-nm particles (Leica EM ACE200), and ﬁnally visualized in a scanning electron microscope (JEOLJSM-6010 Plus/LA) operating at 20kV. For analysis of capsular dimensions, at least 50 cells wereanalyzed individually and had their total area determined using ImageJ software (National Institutesof Health). Since no differences in cell bodies were observed between the different strains andconditions used in this study, we assumed that differences in the total cellular area reﬂectedalterations in capsular dimensions.

Among the diverse molecules carried by fungal EVs, anumber of immunogens, virulence factors and regulators have been characterised. Within EVs, these components could potentially impact disease outcomes by inter- acting with the host. From this perspective, we previously demonstrated that EVs from Candida albicans could be taken up by and activate macrophages and dendritic cells to produce cytokines and express costimulatory molecules. Moreover, pre- treatment of Galleria mellonella larvae with fungal EVs protected the insects against a subsequent lethal infection with C. albicans yeasts. These data indicate that C. albicans EVs are multi-antigenic compartments that activate the innate immune system and could be exploited as vaccine formulations. Here, we investigated whether immunisation with C. albicans EVs induces a protective effect against murine candidiasis in immunosuppressed mice. Total and fungal antigen-specific serum IgG antibodies increased by 21 days after immunisation, confirming the efficacy of theprotocol. Vaccination decreased fungal burden in the liver, spleen and kidney of mice challenged with C. albicans . Splenic levels of cytokines indicated a lower inflammatory response in mice immunised with EVs when compared with EVs + Freund's adjuvant (ADJ). Higher levels of IL-12p70, TNF αand IFN γwere detected in mice vaccinated with EVs + ADJ, while IL-12p70, TGF β, IL-4 and IL-10 were increased when no adju- vants were added. Full protection of lethally challenged mice was observed when EVs were administered, regardless the presence of adjuvant.

Nonetheless, it is also one of the major opportunistic fungal pathogens, causing superficial cutaneous mucosa(oral and vaginal) and life-threatening disseminated infections (Gow, Van De Veerdonk, Brown, & Netea, 2012; Kim & Sudbery, 2011). This species is the most frequent pathogen causing recurrent vulvovaginalcandidiasis (RVVC), affecting over 370 million women during their lifetime (Denning, Kneale, Sobel, & Rautemaa-Richardson, 2018). In addition, C. albicans causes a systemic disease in immunocompromised patients, the so-called invasive candidiasis (Pappas, Lionakis, Arendrup, Ostrosky-Zeichner, & Kullberg, 2018). Oral and vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) in patients that are not critically ill are usually treated with azolederivatives, such as fluconazole (Sobel, 2016). However, echinocandinsrecently became the initial choice for the treatment of RVVC and systemic candidiasis (Bassetti, Righi, Montravers, & Cornely, 2018; Cornely et al., 2012; Pappas et al., 2016). Amphotericin B is also rec-ommended to combat systemic candidiasis, but only when azoles and echinocandins are limited by intolerance, resistance or unavailability (Cornely et al., 2012; Pappas et al., 2016). Despite the recent changesand advances in treatment, systemic candidiasis remains associated with high mortality rates (Bassetti, Righi, Montravers, & Cornely, 2018; Pappas, Lionakis, Arendrup, Ostrosky-Zeichner, & Kullberg, 2018).Moreover, there are reports of increasing numbers of C. albicans strains resistant to current antifungal drugs (Fisher, Hawkins, Sanglard, & Gurr, 2018; Pappas et al., 2018). Thus, the development of alternative therapeutic strategies and prophylactic tools is imperative.", "Considering that systemic candidiasis is usually associated with altered immune status, such as neutrophil or CD4 +T cells immunode- ficiencies, adjunctive therapies that stimulate effector functions inthe immune response are potential alternatives (Cassone, 2013; Cassone & Rappuoli, 2010; Kullberg & van de Veerdonk, 2014; Scriven, Tenforde, Levitz, & Jarvis, 2017). This stimulation should bespecially effective when the pre-existing immunity is modified or strongly reduced by immunosuppressing conditions (Cassone, 2013).", "In this context, live attenuated strains, cytoplasm and cell wall extractsas well as purified proteins and conjugated polysaccharides havebeen explored in vaccine formulations to control disseminated candi- diasis in murine models (Ahmad, Fatima, Saleemuddin, & Owais, 2012; De Bernardis et al., 2012; Li et al., 2011; Raska et al., 2008; Saville,Lazzell, Chaturvedi, Monteagudo, & Lopez-Ribot, 2009; Sui, Yan, & Jiang, 2017; Thomas et al., 2006; Vilanova et al., 2004; Wu, Lipinski,Carrel, Bailey, & Bundle, 2007). Although attenuated strains have pro- vided full protection (Saville et al., 2009), they are particularly riskyunder conditions of limited immune response. Immunisation with cellwall (Thomas et al., 2006) and cytoplasmic (Ahmad et al., 2012) fungal extracts is protective against murine candidiasis, but the methods of extraction and the batch-to-batch differences are problems thathave yet to be circumvented. In addition, it is likely that the methods used for antigen extraction from the cell wall promote changes the native structure of the immunogens. For instance, native cryptococcalglucuronoxylomannan is biologically different from the detergent- extracted polysaccharide (Frases, Nimrichter, Viana, Nakouzi, & Casadevall, 2008). A number of univalent vaccines, formulations carry-ing a single antigen, have been investigated in mice models and two of them tested in human clinical trials (De Bernardis et al., 2012; Li et al., 2011; Raska et al., 2008; Sui, Yan, & Jiang, 2017; Vilanovaet al., 2004). However, according to Cassone (Cassone, 2013;Cassone & Rappuoli, 2010), the use of univalent formulations would be able to induce protection limited to specific body niches sites.", "Indeed, the use of univalent vaccine formulations seems to protectmice and humans in VVC and RVVC, but not against disseminated candidiasis (Cassone, 2013). Thus, the development of a safe and well-designed multivalent vaccine formulation could promote protec-tion to different targets and against disseminated candidiasis. The major limitations include the elevated cost of development and the ability to determine the perfect combination of antigens.", "Recent studies suggest that fungal extracellular vesicles (EVs) may represent a new alternative for the development of multivalent vaccine formulations (Colombo et al., 2019; Joffe, Nimrichter, Rodrigues, & Del Poeta, 2016; Nimrichter et al., 2016; Rizzo, Nimrichter, &Rodrigues, 2017; Rodrigues, Nakayasu, Almeida, & Nimrichter, 2014). Fungal EVs were isolated in 2007 from the culture supernatant of Cryp- tococcus neoformans (Rodrigues et al., 2007a). Since then, fungal EVs have been characterised in several fungal species including C. albicans , Candida glabrata ,Paracoccidioides brasiliensis ,Sporothrix brasiliensis ,Cryp- tococcus gattii ,Histoplasma capsulatum ,Saccharomyces cerevisiae ,Pichia fermentans ,Malassezia sympodialis ,Alternaria infectoria and Aspergillus fumigatus (Albuquerque, 2004; Bielska et al., 2018; Ikeda et al., 2018; Leone et al., 2018; Oliveira et al., 2010b; Rayner et al., 2017; Silvaet al., 2014; Souza et al., 2019; Vallejo et al., 2011; Vargas et al., 2015).As multi-antigenic compartments, fungal EVs carry a number of native structures such as proteins, pigments, polysaccharides, lipids and nucleic acids (Da Silva et al., 2015; Eisenman, Frases, Nicola, Rodrigues, &Casadevall, 2009; Nimrichter et al., 2016; Rodrigues et al., 2007a; Rodrigues et al., 2008; Vallejo et al., 2011; Vargas et al., 2015). Some2o f1 5 VARGAS ET AL. of these components are conserved among the different species, but others are species-specific (Nimrichter et al., 2016). EVs isolated frompathogens contain a diverse array of virulence factors and regulators as well as highly immunogenic components that could directly contribute to disease development. In vitro, these EVs are able to stimulate macro-phages and dendritic cells (Da Silva, Roque-Barreira, Casadevall, & Almeida, 2016; Vargas et al., 2015; Zamith-Miranda, Nimrichter, Rodrigues, & Nosanchuk, 2018). They regulate cytokine productionin phagocytes, macrophage polarisation and the expression of co- stimulatory molecules in dendritic cells (DCs; Vargas et al., 2015). In addition, pre-treatment of Galleria mellonella larvae with fungal EVs stim- ulated a protective response against a lethal challenge with C. albicans orC. neoformans (Colombo et al., 2019; Vargas et al., 2015). In other models, the exposure of host cells to fungal EVs have been also associ- ated with disease development, as demonstrated for C. neoformans and S. brasiliensis (Huang et al., 2012; Ikeda et al., 2018). In addition, fungal EVs seem to participate in the development of antifungal resistance and as a messenger compartment for virulence transference (Bielskaet al., 2018; Mitchell et al., 2018). Based on the composition and biological activities of C. albicans EVs, we investigated whether these compartments could be usedas a multivalent antigenic vaccine formulation in a lethal murine candi- diasis model. We initially developed an intraperitoneal prime-boost immunisation murine model using C. albicans EVs and then evaluated total and specific serum immunoglobulin levels, fungal burden in dif-ferent tissues, cytokine production in the spleen and mice survival during a lethal challenge with yeasts of C. albicans . Then, we tested the stability and morphological properties of fungal EVs stored at lowtemperatures using dynamic light scattering and transmission electron microscopy. Stored EVs were tested according to their ability to acti- vate murine bone marrow-derived DCs and protect G. mellonella lar- vae challenged with a lethal inoculum of C. albicans yeasts. Our results demonstrated that fungal EVs are stable formulations with the poten- tial to combat candidiasis.", "2|RESULTS 2.1 |Fungal EVs from C. albicans activate the humoral immune response To investigate the ability of C. albicans EVs to stimulate the humoral response, we carried out a prime and boost immunisation protocol using EVs stored at 4/C14C, the same conditions used for all the studies previously performed in our laboratory (Oliveira et al., 2010a; Vargas et al., 2015). Figure 1 shows our vaccination strategy. We first aimed to determine the number of immunisations required to induce anti-body production in mice. Prior to the first immunisation step, serumfrom all mice was collected. Then, EVs, EVs + ADJ, ADJ or PBS were inoculated intraperitoneally, and the serum collected before each of the three additional boosts to follow up the production of IgMand IgG. We detected an increase of total IgM 1 week after the first immunisation only with EVs + ADJ (day 7; Figure 2a). However,total IgG increased after the third immunisation (day 21), for all groups except for the PBS-treated mice (control; Figure 2a). Basedon these results, we decided to immunise the mice four times before infection.", "We then investigated the specificity of the IgM and IgG produced after immunisation against C. albicans protein extract (Ca-Ptn, Figure 2b) and EVs (and Figure 2c). In general, we observed a slight increase in IgM production against both Ca-Ptn and EVs at day 7, withlow variation during later periods. Similar to serum IgG concentration, a significant increase of IgG anti-Ca-Ptn and EVs at day 21 was observed in mice immunised with EVs + ADJ and EVs. The predomi-nant IgG classes reactive to Ca-Ptn were IgG1 from mice immunisedwith EVs + ADJ. IgG1 was also the major class recognising EVs anti- gens when mice were immunised with EVs + ADJ or EVs (Figure 1).", "In addition, the increased reactivity of IgG antibodies from miceimmunised with EVs + ADJ was highly associated with BCG antigens present in the ADJ (Figure S1).", "2.2 |Vaccination with EVs decreased fungal burden in mice tissues To determine whether the treatment with C. albicans EVs can control C. albicans dissemination in immunosuppressed mice, the immunisation protocol was followed by a single dose of cyclophosphamide (CP;Figure 1) and 2 days later, the mice were infected intraperitoneally with a lethal inoculum of C. albicans yeast cells. Three and five days post-infection, fungal burden in the kidney, spleen and liver was deter-mined (Figure 3). Immunisation with fungal EVs and EVs + ADJ signifi- cantly decreased the CFU in all organs, suggesting a protective effect.", "When the CFU was compared between the formulations containingEVs, the presence of adjuvants decreased the CFU at day 3 in spleen and liver, and at day 5 in all organs.", "2.3 |Immunisation with C. albicans EVs induces different profiles of cytokines In order to better understand the impact of immunisation with fungal EVs during the immune response, we also measured the cytokines produced in the spleens of mice at different time-points after infec-tion (3 and 5 days). Mice vaccinated with fungal EVs produced higher of IL-12p70 at days 3 and 5, while treatment with EVs + ADJ dis- played substantially high levels for this cytokine at day 3, returning tothe levels similar to EVs stimulation at day 5 (Figure 4a). Also, day", "3 demonstrated an increase of TNF- αproduction when mice were", "immunised with EVs and EVs + ADJ (Figure 4b). After 5 days, all con-ditions showed an increased production of TNF α, but only EVs + ADJ displayed a statistically significant raise (Figure 4b, p< .05). Remark- ably, only spleens from mice immunised with EVs showed a higher level of IL-10 (day 3), TGF- β(days 3 and 5) and IL-4 (day 3; Figure 4c –e). The cytokines IFN- γand IL-6 were not detected after 3 days of infection; however, both increased for all mice after 5 days. A higherVARGAS ET AL. 3o f1 5 and significant level was observed for both cytokines only when fun- gal EVs + ADJ were used as a vaccine formulation (Figure 4f,g).", "2.4 |Immunisation with EVs protected mice against a lethal infection with C. albicans After a lethal infection with C. albicans yeast cells, all non-immunised or ADJ-immunised mice died by 15 days of infection (Figure 5). How- ever, immunisation with EVs alone or EVs-ADJ formulations inducedfull protection, with all mice surviving until the end of the experi- ments ( p< .05).2.5 |Fungal EVs from C. albicans were preserved after storage at low temperatures Considering the protective effects of fungal EVs, we evaluated their stability as a potential parameter for determining their future applica- bility as vaccine candidates. Maintenance of EV dimensions has beenproposed as a parameter of vesicular stability (Almeida et al., 2017;Wolf, Rivera, & Casadevall, 2012). We therefore adopted EV dimen- sions in association with microscopic observation to evaluate the effects of storage on EV stability. Initial experiments were performedto investigate the stability of fungal EVs after storage at 4, −20 and /C14C. The average diameter size was evaluated using DLS and FIGURE 1 Experimental design. The strategy used to immunise and infect the mice was represented as a function of time. All treatments were intraperitoneal. First immunisation was given on day 1 right after serum collection, followed by three boosts and cyclophosphamidetreatment (CP).

For all samples, a bimodal distri-bution was visualised. Two populations of fungal EVs were detected,ranging between 30 –75 and 140 –230 nm. TEM of fresh and stored EVs demonstrated the presence of round shaped bilayered membra- nous structures within the size rates observed by DLS analysis. Inorder to confirm the size of the EVs, we also evaluated the samples using nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA). Minimal changes in sizewere observed when the EVs were stored at 4, −20 or −80 /C14C, in com- parison with fresh samples (Figure 6). In all tested conditions, the pop-ulation of EVs ranged between 60 and 350 nm. However, EVs kept at4 /C14C showed a less homogeneous distribution in size. Finally, no agglu- tination or membrane fragments were observed in TEM micrographies or DLS analysis, since DLS is also able to detect micelles or smallerparticles (Moniruzzaman, Kamiya, & Goto, 2010; Stetefeld, McKenna, & Patel, 2016).", "FIGURE 3 Vaccination with C. albicans EVs reduces fungal burden.

To investigate whether storage would modify the ability of C. albicans EVs to activate DCs, we examined IL-6 and IL-10 production after overnight stimulation with these compart- ments. Independent of the storage conditions, all fungal EVs induced IL-6. However, stimulation with EVs kept at −80 /C14C was significantly reduced when compared with fresh and that storage at −20/C14C. On the other hand, IL-10 production was minimal for all EV samples (Figure 7).", "2.7 |Pretreatment with fungal EVs decreased the lethality of C. albicans in a G. mellonella model of infection We used G. mellonella larvae to study whether fungal EVs stor- age could impact their ability to protect the insect against a lethal challenge with C. albicans . Fungal EVs were administered in concentrations previously described by our group as capable ofsignificantly reduce larvae mortality and fungal burden (Vargaset al., 2015). The G. mellonella survival data indicated that all fun- gal EVs tested were able to protect the larvae from C. albicans infection, independent of their storage conditions (Figure 8).However, fresh fungal EVs resul ted in the highest survival rates (62%).3|DISCUSSION Fungal EVs can directly modulate the innate immune system with a promising potential to trigger the development of adaptive responses (Vargas et al., 2015). Since fungal EVs carry a combination of nativeimmunogens in a cell-free system, they may be a safe source of immu- nogens for the development of vaccine formulations. In fact, the immunomodulatory activity of fungal EVs has been clearly demon-strated in several in vitro models (Baltazar et al., 2018; Bielska et al., 2018; Da Silva et al., 2016; Joffe et al., 2016; Oliveira, Freire- de-Lima, et al., 2010; Souza et al., 2019; Vargas et al., 2015), as wellas their ability to prolong the survival of invertebrate models of infec-tion with C. albicans orC. neoformans (Colombo et al., 2019; Vargas et al., 2015). However, the protective effects of fungal EVs in mam- malian models of fungal infections have not yet been demonstrated,which hampers the design of fungal EV-based vaccine formulations. In this study, we demonstrated that fungal EVs efficiently protect immu- nosuppressed mice against a lethal C. albicans infection.", "As demonstrated previously by our group, DCs treated with C. albicans EVs exhibited an increase in MHCII and CD86 expression, suggesting that these compartments could mediate an efficient com-munication between the innate and the adaptive immune response (Vargas et al., 2015). To investigate this possibility, we developed a protocol for mice immunisation using fungal EVs in the presence orabsence of classic vaccine adjuvants. Our results demonstrated thatone initial vaccination and three additional boosts are required to stimulate a significant increase in antibody production. We found that most of the serum antibodies that recognise fungal antigens, bothC. albicans crude extract and EVs, belong to the IgG1 subclass. Although our data indicate that the addition of adjuvants promotes a polyclonal B-cell response, further studies are required to determinewhether the antibodies produced after immunisation with C. albicans EVs are specific and/or effector components of the immune response.", "The reduced fungal burden in the spleen, liver and kidney of mice immunised with EV formulations clearly shows that vaccinationdecreases C. albicans dissemination. It is noteworthy that during these time intervals, mice are still neutropenic and susceptible to fungal dis- semination, supporting the efficiency of the vaccination protocol inimmunosuppressed animals. These data corroborate with the full pro- tection observed in the survival experiment using both EVs or EVs + ADJ as vaccine formulations. However, the cytokine profile in thespleen of mice was distinct when immunisation with EVs and EVs + ADJ was compared suggesting a different protective immunological regulation for both formulations. Although the pro-inflammatory cyto-kines IL12p70 and TNF αincreased at day 3 for both conditions, IL-4 and TGF βwere significantly higher in the absence of adjuvants. In general, IL-4 is associated with TH1 inhibition and has a pivotal roleinducing a TH2 response and susceptibility to candidiasis (Puccettiet al., 1994; Tonnetti et al., 1995). However, IL-4 can also play a protective role in candidiasis. Presence of IL-4 was required for pro- tection through a mechanism involving the induction of CD4 +TH1 response (Romani et al., 1994; Spaccapelo et al., 1995). An increased production of IL-4 was detected in memory CD4+T cells after aFIGURE 5 Vaccination with C. albicans EVs induced protection against disseminated candidiasis in mice. Mice were immunised withC. albicans EVs, immunosuppressed with cyclophosphamide (CP) and then challenged with a lethal inoculum of C. albicans yeasts.

Cor- roborating with that, TGF βseems to be involved with acquired resis- tance and its presence is required for optimal TH1 development and long-term anticandidal activities (Spaccapelo et al., 1995). Of note, the participation of TGF βas an inducer of memory CD4 cells in mice has been reported (Swain, Huston, Tonkonogy, & Weinberg, 1991). Inter-estingly, TGF- βwas able to enhance both memory phenotype of antigen-specific murine TH1 cells and their effector function in exper- imental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (Weinberg et al., 1992).", "A higher inflammatory activity mediated by EVs + ADJ was con- firmed at day 5, when increased levels of TNF α, IFN γand IL-6 weredetected. In mice immunised with EVs, the IL-6 increase in combina- tion with the presence of TGF βcould trigger the development of a TH17 response (Mangan et al., 2006), also supported by the potential TH1 inhibitory activity of IL-4. Excepting for the increase in IL-10 and TGF βat day 5, all the cytokines detected after EV immunisation were similar to PBS and ADJ. Under these conditions, the cytokinesassociated with anti-inflammatory responses would be important for restoring normal conditions. Based on our data, we could not rule out that the infection was resolved faster when the EVs were used alone.However, the fungal burden was similar during days 3 and 5 after immunisation with EVs or EVs + ADJ, which argues against this FIGURE 6 Effect of low temperature storage on fungal EVs size and stability.

The addition of adjuvant apparently favoured an inflam- matory response.", "Our results confirm that fungal EVs are promising multi-antigenic compartments to be exploited as vaccine formulations. However, the mechanisms by which EVs mediate this protection remain to be determined. A number of components carried by C. albicans EVs could be individually and/or collectively involved in the protectiveeffects. Indeed, proteomic analysis of C. albicans EVs was previously performed and a list of proteins successfully used in murine vaccina- tion models were characterised, including (a) enolase-1 (Eno1),(b) MP65, (c) Bgl-2, (d) the agglutinin-like sequence protein 3 (Alsp3) and (e) the secreted aspartyl protease 2 (Sap2; Vargas et al., 2015;Gil-Bona et al., 2015). Thus, the mechanism by which the fungal EVs induce protection is most probably dependent on a combination of antigens that stimulates: (a) phagocyte activation with the up- regulation of cytokines (Oliveira et al., 2010a; Vargas et al., 2015),(b) activation of antigen presenting cells (Vargas et al., 2015), with potential induction of TH17 response and (c) antibody production.", "The presence of mannosylated proteins and the mechanism of inter-nalisation of Ca l b i c a n s EVs suggest the participation of cell surface receptors (Gil-Bona et al., 2015; Vargas et al., 2015). This activation could be at least in part be mediated by MP65, a mannoprotein enriched in EVs that modulates the expression of CD86 and MHCIIby dendritic cells (Gomez et al., 1996; Pietrella, Bistoni, Corbucci, Perito, & Vecchiarelli, 2006) and induces the production of cytokines, similar to what has been observed when DCs were incubated withC. albicans EVs (Vargas et al., 2015). Two specific proteins carried by C. albicans EVs, Als-3 and Sap2 have been extensively investigated in vaccine studies (De Bernardis et al., 2012; Sui et al., 2017).The N-terminal domain of Als-3 was formulated with aluminium hydroxide as adjuvant (NDV-3 vaccine). In humans, this formulation was safe, tolerable and stimulated an immunogenic response (Schmidt et al., 2012) and is currently in a Phase 2 trial. In addition,recombinant Sap2 was incorporated into influenza virosomes (PEV7) and has completed Phase 1 clinical trial (De Bernardis, Graziani, Tirelli, & Antonopoulou, 2018). Protection in mice by the-se antigens is mediated through mechanisms that include shifts in TH1 and TH17 cytokines as well as antibody production (De Bernardis et al., 2012; De Bernardis, Arancia, Sandini, Graziani, &Norelli, 2015). The combination of all these immunogens in their native structure could potentiate the efficacy of C. albicans EVs as a vaccine. In fact, the use of combined antigens has been previously investigated before.Torosantucci et al. (2005)) conjugated β-glucan to CRM197, a non- toxic mutant of diphtheria toxin that functions as a carrier protein, and this formulation protected mice against vulvovaginal and systemiccandidiasis. Additional optimised formulations were recently tested by Bundle, Paszkiewicz, Elsaidi, Mandal, and Sarkar (2018) who FIGURE 7 Effects of storage conditions on the induction of IL-6 and IL-10 in dendritic cells (DCs). DCs were pre-treated with fungal EVs and the levels of IL-6 and IL-10 were determined. Results are representative of two independent experiments. Statistical analysis was performedusing one-way ANOVA analysis of variance, and the difference between groups was analysed by Bonferroni post-test, * p< .0001; ** p= .0015 FIGURE 8 Pre-treatment with fungal EVs reduced the mortality ofG. mellonella larvae infected with C. albicans . Survival curves of larvae pre-treated with fungal EVs stored under different conditions (10μlo fa1 0 μM suspension based on the sterol content) and then infected 2 days later with a lethal inoculum of C. albicans yeasts are shown. Statistical analysis was performed using one-way analysis ofvariance, and the survival differences between each EV groups andPBS were analysed by individual paired log-rank (Mantel –Cox; Table S1). Results are representative of two independent experiments8o f1 5 VARGAS ET AL. conjugated β-mannans to β-glucans to obtain more efficient immuno- gens. Other highly conserved EVs components, such as metabolicenzymes (e.g., from the glycolytic pathway), heat shock proteins and the glycosphingolipid glucosylceramide (GlcCer), potentially stimulate the immune system against a variety of fungal species (Nimrichteret al., 2004; Raska et al., 2008; Rodrigues et al., 2007b). In combina- tion, these antigens could induce crossed protection against other fungal pathogens, which still has to be experimentally addressedfor fungal EVs. In other models, immunisation with C. albicans aldolase, a metabolic enzyme that is abundant in EVs, conferred pro- tection against C. glabrata (Medrano-Díaz, Vega-González, Ruiz-Baca, Moreno, & Cuéllar-Cruz, 2018). In addition, immunisation of mice withGlcCer protected mice against a lethal inoculum of C. neoformans (Mor et al., 2016). We previously demonstrated that passive immunisation with anti-GlcCer antibodies prolongs the survival ofmice challenged with C. neoformans (Rodrigues et al., 2007b). The crossed protection activity of C. albicans EVs is currently under investigation in our laboratory, as well as of the potentialEV-associated cell surface pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) and pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). EVs produced by C. albicans and other fungal species are the vehicles of RNA export (Da Silva et al., 2015). Therefore, it is reasonable to expect that, if released within the host cells, vesicular RNA could potentially activate TLR9. Alternatively, since TLR9 can be recruited to the phagosomeswhen dectin-1 is activated (Khan et al., 2016), trafficking of EVs tophagosomes could also trigger TLR9 activation. Finally, we cannot rule out the participation of polysaccharides in the activation of innate responses. Recently, Silva and colleagues demonstrated that EVs fromParaccoidioides brasiliensis are recognised by DC-SIGN in vitro (Peres da Silva et al., 2015). However, such components have not been reported in C. albicans EVs.", "The use of fungal EVs in vaccine preparations depends on the reproducibility of their protective effects, which is directly related to their stability. Indeed, intact fungal EVs could function as a delivery sys-tem similar to liposomes, preventing antigen degradation, which wouldincrease their relative concentration and facilitate the delivery of fungal components to antigen presenting cells (Giddam, Zaman, Skwarczynski, & Toth, 2012; Peres da Silva et al., 2015). Independent oftheir mechanism for promoting protection, EVs must be carefully iso- lated and stored to keep their functional epitopes structurally stable.", "Although fungal EV isolation protocols have been significantly improvedto speed up and optimise the preparation of vesicular fractions (Reis et al., 2019), storage is a key issue to be considered and thoroughly investigated, since it directly impacts the applicability of fungal EVs asvaccine candidates. In EVs released by mammalian cells, the impact of storage at different temperatures has been investigated, but the results seem to diverge according to the cell line tested, suggesting that eachmodel must be individually investigated (Frank et al., 2018; Gamonetet al., 2017; Maroto et al., 2017; Park, Jeon, Yoo, & Lee, 2018; Sokolova et al., 2011). The effects of storage on fungal EVs are poorly known. In C. neoformans , vesicle stability appears to be distinct according to the EV population (Wolf et al., 2012). Larger EVs, varying from 100 to 200 nm, were stable for at least 72 hr at room temperature inconditioned medium. In contrast, smaller vesicles, ranging from 40 to 60 nm, decreased in size after 24 hr of storage. In our experiments,C. albicans EVs were kept at lower temperatures for 7 days and their size compared with fresh preparations. Using DLS as a tool to measure size, we showed that EVs from C. albicans consist of two populations, comparable to what was previously described by our group (Vargas et al., 2015). The particle range measured by DLS after storage was rela- tively homogeneous and similar to the fresh prepared EVs. A smallincrease in size was observed in the smaller population of EVs after storage at 4 and −20 /C14C. The larger vesicles were also slightly increased when storage was carried out at 4/C14C. These modest changes could be explained by EV fusion or aggregation. Increasing in EV size has beenreported after freezing, caused by multilamellar formation due to the expansion of ice nano- or micro-crystals in the lipid bilayer (Lee, Ban, Im, & Kim, 2016). This effect was not evident in our TEM images afterstorage at −20 and −80 /C14C. Despite our multiple approaches suggesting that the EVs were stable and intact, the data do not absolutely rule out that there was no disruption and reassembly of the vesicles. However,the absence of membrane fragments or debris, which would be detected both by TEM and DLS, suggests that most of the EVs were intact. The preservation of their dimensions was confirmed by NTA,which revealed EV populations very similar in dimensions independently of storage conditions. However, it is noteworthy that, so far, there are no authoritative methods to determine the size of EVs (Théryet al., 2018). A combination of fluorescent labelling EVs and particlecounting technologies, such as NTA, is recommended. However, anti- bodies and lipid dyes can form particles that could interfere with data analysis. Thus, although there remains a theoretical methodological limi-tation in our current investigation, our data indicate that although fungal EVs were relatively stable and that the −80 /C14C temperature was appar- ently the best storage condition, at least for C. albicans fungal EVs.", "Since EVs integrity was maintained under different storage condi- tions, we subsequently investigated whether the immunogens also conserved their antigenic activity. Most importantly, storage condi-tions did not abrogate the ability of EVs to activate DCs. Treatmentwith EVs increased the production of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6, consistent with previous data from our lab confirming the activa- tion of DCs through EVs recognition (Vargas et al., 2015). In addition,lower levels of IL-10 were detected. Fungal EV storage at lower tem- peratures did not affect protection against C. albicans inG. mellonella , a reliable model to investigate the activation of innate immuneresponses (Fuchs & Mylonakis, 2006). Our results not only confirmed previous experiments published by our lab, showing that fungal EVs stimulated the innate immune response and protected the insect(Vargas et al., 2015), but also demonstrated that C. albicans EVs could be stored at lower temperatures without losing their ability to activate DCs and the innate immune system.", "Our present study shows that immunisation with C. albicans EVs stimulates a protective immune response in a murine model of candi- diasis. These results, in association with the stability of fungal EVs preparations, open a new venue for the development of novel andefficient vaccines to prevent candidiasis and potentially other fungal infections. The use of mutant strains lacking virulence factors can alsoVARGAS ET AL. 9o f1 5 be explored as well as the development of platforms to generate EVs tailored with heterologous antigens originally from pathogenic fungiand expressed in non-pathogenic fungal species. Furthermore, anti- gens from bacteria, viruses and parasites could also be combined with fungal components for immunological assays of prophylaxis or treat-ment by boosting the immune system. 4|EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES 4.1 |Culture of fungal cells Candida albicans strain 11 is a clinical bloodstream isolated from a 46-year-old male patient, kindly provided by Dr. Marcos Dornelas (Laboratory of Microbiology and Mycology, State Institute of Hema-tology Arthur de Siqueira Cavalcanti, HemoRio). The strain was stored in solid Sabouraud/glycerol agar medium and maintained at −80 Yeast cells were cultured in liquid Sabouraud for 48 hr at 30/C14C under agitation (150 rpm).", "4.2 |Preparation of fungal EVs Fungal EVs were isolated from C. albicans culture supernatants (Vargas et al., 2015). Yeasts were inoculated in a 100 ml Erlenmeyer flask con-taining 20 ml of liquid Sabouraud medium and cultured under agitation (150 rpm) at room temperature for 48 hr. The pre-inoculum was then transferred to a 1,000 ml Erlenmeyer flask containing 400 ml of liquidSabouraud medium and cultivated under the same conditions. The yeasts were separated from the culture supernatant according to the protocol previously described in our laboratory (Vargas et al., 2015).The whole preparation was developed at 4 /C14C. Briefly, the culture was centrifuged at 4,000 gfor 15 min. The supernatants were collected and further centrifuged at 15,000 gfor 15 min to remove cell debris. Resid- ual cells and debris were removed after a step of filtration using a0.8μm membrane filter (Merck Millipore). The cell-free supernatant was concentrated about 25-fold using an Amicon ultrafiltration system (100 kDa membrane). The concentrated supernatant was then cen-trifuged at 100,000 gfor 1 hr. The pellet was washed twice with 0.1M phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) pH 7.4. Fungal EVs were suspended in PBS and aliquots were plated onto Sabouraud agar plates to confirmthe absence of any contaminant, confirmed by no colony observation. Quantification of EVs was developed using the quantitative Amplex Red Sterol Assay Kit (Invitrogen) and the BCA Protein Assay Kit(ThermoFisher). Quality control of EVs preparation was performed by dynamic light scattering (DLS) as described below (Vargas et al., 2015).", "4.3 |Detection of antibody classes Serum pool of five animals was used for antibody detection. For IgM and global IgG analysis, goat anti-mouse IgM or IgG (SouthernBiotech, Alabama), 1 μg/ml diluted in PBS, was pre-immobilised to half-area highbinding 96-well ELISA plates, following incubation at 4/C14C overnight. Afterwards, the plates were subjected to four washes with PBS andblocked with PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 1 hr and 30 min at room temperature. BSA was removed and the plates were washed with PBS, serum samples were diluted 1:100 in PBS-1%BSA and serially threefold and fivefold diluted to determine the concen- tration of IgM and IgG respectively. IgM and IgG (1 μg/ml) diluted 1:3 and 1:5, respectively, were used as the standard curve. The sampleswere incubated at 4 /C14C overnight. Plates were washed four times with PBS and incubated with 50 μl of goat anti-mouse IgM (1:4,000) and IgG (1:8,000; SouthernBiotech) conjugated to peroxidase (HRP) diluted inPBS 1% BSA and incubated at room temperature for 1 hr 30 min. Atthe end, the plates were again subjected to four washes with PBS and then developed with TMB (3,3', 5,5; −tetramethylbenzidine; Thermo Fisher); the reaction was stopped with 50 μl of 3N HCl and the reading performed on a 450 and 650 nm filter microplate reader (iMark; BioRad).", "4.4 |Protein extraction To extract proteins from C. albicans , an adaptation of the method used by Dojnov and colleagues was used (Dojnov, Bozi /C19c, Bulaji /C19c, & Vujci /C19c, 2007). Briefly, C. albicans yeasts (108cells) were suspended in 1 ml of lysis buffer (0.06M Tris HCl, pH 6, 10% glycerol, 5%2-mercaptoethanol) and the suspension was submitted to six cycles of", "1 min in ultrasonic bath (22 KHz) alternating with 30 s pauses. Sus-", "pensions were centrifuged at 5,000 gfor 15 min and the supernatants collected. The cells were suspended in the same lysis buffer and trans- ferred to 2 ml tubes containing glass beads (0.5 –0.75 mm; 1:3 vol/ vol). The cells were disrupted using a Thermo Savant Fastprep FP120device using 10 cycles of 2 min, with 2 min alternating pauses at 4 The samples were then centrifuged at 5,000 gfor 15 min. The super- natants (cytosolic proteins) were saved and the pellets, containing thecell wall antigens, were suspended in lysis buffer supplemented with2% SDS and boiled for 2 min at 100 /C14C for protein extraction. After centrifugation under the same conditions described above, all the supernatants were combined and the pellets discarded. Total proteinwas quantified using the BCA protein quantification kit (Pierce). 4.5 |Detection of antibody subclasses Serum pooled from five animals was used for antibody detection. For IgG subclass determination, 50 μl/well of antigens (EVs, proteins from C. albicans yeasts and BCG) were added to half-area high binding 96-well ELISA plates in a final concentration of 10 μg/ml and the sam- ples were incubated overnight incubation at 4/C14C. The wells were sub- jected to four washes with PBS and blocked with PBS containing 1% BSA for 90 min at room temperature. Serum samples were diluted 1:40; 1:120; 1:360 and 1:1080 in PBS-1% BSA and then added to thewells. The plates were incubated at 4 /C14C overnight, followed by four more washing steps with PBS. A final volume of 50 μl of the10 of 15 VARGAS ET AL. subclasses reporter antibodies (anti-IgG1, IgG2a, IgG2b and IgG3, diluted 1:1000 in PBS 1% BSA) conjugated to HRP was added to thewells and incubated for 90 min at room temperature. The wells were again subjected to four washes with PBS and then developed with TMB; the reaction was stopped with 50 μl of 3 N HCl and read on a 450 and 650 nm filter microplate reader (iMark, BioRad).", "4.6 |Mouse model Female BALB/c mice (6 –8 weeks, 11 animals per group) were immunised intraperitoneally four times, 1 week apart, with 200 μlo fa n EV suspension at a final sterol concentration of 10 μM in PBS, formu- lated or not with Freund's adjuvant (ADJ; Sigma-Aldrich) diluted 1:1 (vol/vol) in the EV suspension (fresh preparations kept at 4/C14Cu pt o", "36 hr).

Four days after the third boost, the animals were immuno- suppressed with cyclophosphamide (200 mg/kg) intraperitoneally.Under these conditions, cyclophosphamide induces mice neutropenia with maximum effect between days 3 and 4 (Segal, 1981). Neutropenia is usually restored 10 post-administration. Three days later, the animalswere inoculated intraperitoneally with a lethal inoculum of C. albicans", "7yeasts per mouse). Blood was collected at days 0, 7, 14, 21,", "25 and 28 days. The blood was centrifuged at 10,000 gfor 10 min, and", "the serum (upper phase) was collected and stored at −80/C14C for further analysis. All mice were treated according to the ethical guidelines for animal experimentation (Protocol 01200.001568/2013 –17, approved in 2019 by CEUA, UFRJ). The number of deaths was evaluated daily.Survival curves were plotted, and statistical analyses were performed using the log-rank (Mantel –Cox) survival test.", "4.7 |Fungal burden and cytokine measurements Following the immunisations and immunosupression, 3 and 5 days after fungal infection mice were euthanized and the organs (kidney, liver and spleen) excised, weighted and homogenised in 5 ml of PBS for the analysis of the fungal load by the enumeration of colony for-ming units (CFUs) and determination of the cytokines profile. The CFUs were determined after plating successive dilutions of organs homogenate onto Sabouraud agar and incubation at 30 /C14C for 48 hr.", "Homogenates were also used for the measurement of cytokines. The cytokines TNF- α, IL-12, IL-10, TGF- β, IL-4, IL-6 and INF- γwere quan- tified using commercial kits from eBioscience (US) according to themanufacturer's protocols. Statistical analysis was performed using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), and the difference between groups were analysed by Tukey post-test.", "4.8 |EVs stability at low temperatures To investigate the stability of the fungal EVs, 200 μl aliquots (final concentration of 10 μM based on sterol content) were stored atdistinct temperatures; 4, −20 and −80/C14C. After 7 days, the aliquots were thawed at room temperature and then their dimensions wereanalysed by two independent approaches. First, EVs were analysed using dynamic light scattering (DLS) in a 90Plus/BIMAS Multi-Angle Particle Size Analyzer (Brookhaven Instruments) as described (Vargaset al., 2015). In addition, the EVs were submitted to NTA on an LM10 nanoparticle analysis system, coupled with a 488-nm laser and equipped with an SCMOS camera and a syringe pump (Malvern Pan- alytical, Malvern, UK) as detailed by Reis et al. (2019). All samples were 700-fold diluted in filtered PBS. Samples were injected using a syringe pump speed of 100, and three videos of 60 s duration cap-tured per sample, with the camera level set to 15, gain set to 3, andviscosity set to that of water (0.954 –0.955 cP). For data analysis, the gain was set to 10 –15 and the detection threshold was set to 2 –3 for all samples. Levels of blur and maximum jump distance were auto-matically set. The data were acquired and analysed using the NTA 3.0 software (Malvern Panalytical). Finally, EVs were visualised by trans- mission electron microscopy (TEM) using a negative staining tech-nique. Briefly, the EVs suspension was adhered to 200-mesh copper grids previously treated with Formvar 0.3% and discharged at PELCO easiGlow ™Glow Discharge Cleaning System. The EVs were then neg- atively contrasted with 1% (mol/vol) uranyl acetate. The micrographs were performed in a JEOL 1200EX 80 kV electronic microscope.", "A fresh preparation of EVs was used as control for DLS, NTA and EManalyses.", "4.9 |Cytokine production by dendritic cells treated with fungal EVs To investigate whether storage would impact fungal EVs ability to acti- vate host cells, bone marrow-derived DCs were treated with pre-stored EVs and the levels of IL-6 and IL-10 evaluated. Bone marrow-derived DCs were obtained from femur and tibia of BALB/c female mice (4 –- 12 weeks old) following the protocol established by Lutz et al. (1999).Briefly, femur and tibia of BALB/c mice (female), aged 4 –12 weeks, were removed. After removal of the musculature and tendons, the intact bones were left in 70% ethanol for 2 –5 min for disinfection followed by washing with sterile PBS. Both ends were sheared with scissors and the bone marrow washed with Hanks' medium containing 2% FBS using a syringe with a 0.45 mm diameter needle. The superna-tant was then centrifuged for 5 min at 1,500 rpm and suspended in", "2 ml of RPMI and 10% FBS.

The supernatants were collected and the cytokines IL-6 and IL-10 were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay as rec- ommended by the manufacturer eBioscience (USA). Lipopolysaccharide(LPS; Sigma; 1 μg/ml) and PBS were used as a positive and negative control respectively. Statistical analysis was performed using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), and the difference between groups wasanalysed by Tukey post-test. 4.10 |Galleria mellonella infection Galleria mellonella larvae in the final instar larval stage were selected according to the similarity in weight (0.10 –0.15 g). Larvae (20 per group) were inoculated with 10 μl of EV suspensions (10 μM per insect, based on sterol quantification) using a 30G insulin syringe into the haemocoel through the last proleg as described by Brennan,Thomas, Whiteway, and Kavanagh (2002). The same volume of PBS was used as negative control. The larvae were then placed in sterile Petri dishes and kept in the dark at 37 /C14C for 2 days. Subsequently, all larvae were inoculated with 10 μl of a suspension containing 2 ×105 yeasts of C. albicans (strain 11). A control group received only the EVs to determine whether these compartments are toxic to the larvae.Larvae were kept under the same conditions above and their mortalitywas monitored by checking twice daily. Death was assessed by the lack of movement in response to stimulation. Survival curves were plotted, and statistical analyses were performed using the log-rank(Mantel –Cox) survival test and displayed results represent the mean percentage survival of larvae from all assays.", "4.11 |Statistics Statistical analyses were performed with the GraphPad 5 software (La Jolla, CA).

In this study, we analyzed the composition of small molecules in samples obta ined from solid cultures ofC. gattii by a combination of chromatographic and spectrometric appr oaches, and untargeted metabolomics. This analysis revealed previous ly unknown components of EVs, including small peptides with known biological functi ons in other models. The peptides found in C. gattii EVs had their chemical structure validated by chemical approaches and comparison with authentic standards, and th eir functions tested in aGalleria mellonella model of cryptococcal infection. One of the vesicular pepti des (isoleucine-proline-isoleucine, Ile-Pro-Ile) improved the survival of G. mellonella lethally infected with C. gattii orC. neoformans . These results indicate that small molecules exported in EVs are biologically active in Cryptococcus. Our study is the ﬁrst to characterize a fungal EV molecule inducing protection, poi nting to an immunological potential of extracellular peptides produced by C.gattii.", "Keywords: Cryptococcusgatti , extracellular vesicles, small molecules, mass spectrometry, Galleriamellonella INTRODUCTION Cryptococcusgattii isafungalpathogenthatcausesdiseaseinimmunocompetentin dividuals.This fungus was responsible for outbreaks in the Paciﬁc Northwest and in the Vancouver Island ( 1). C. gattiivirulent strains, which are endemic in Brazil ( 2), likely emerged from South America ( 3). C. gattiican cause severe lung disease and death without disseminati on. In contrast, its sibling speciesC. neoformans disseminates readily to the central nervous system (CNS) and causes death from meningoencephalitis ( 1).C. gattiiandC. neformans share major virulence determinants, includingtheabilitytoproduceextracellularvesicles(EVs) (4–6).EVsaremembranousstructures produced by prokaryotes and eukaryotes, including 14 fungal g enera (7). In fungi, they were ﬁrst Reis et al. A Protective Tripeptide From Cryptococcus EVs characterized in culture ﬂuids of C. neoformans (6). A decade later,C. gattiiwas also demonstrated to produce EVs in liquid matrices( 4).", "The perception that EVs are essential players in both physiologyandpathogenesisoffungiisnowconsolidated.Much of the knowledge on the functions of fungal EVs has derived from studies of their composition. During the last decade, proteins, lipids, glycans, and nucleic acids were characteri zed as components of fungal EVs ( 8,9). Molecules of low molecular mass, however, have been overlooked. Two recent studies hav e characterized the small molecule composition of Histoplasma capsulatum (10) andPenicillium digitatum EVs (11), but the low molecular mass components of other fungal EVs are unknown.", "Consideringthemoleculardiversityfoundinboth H.capsulatum andP.digitatum ,itisplausibletopredictthatmanystillunknown functionsofEVcomponentsoflowmolecularmassremaintobe characterized. In fact, the metabolome analysis of P. digitatum EVs revealed the presence of phytopathogenic molecules that inhibitedthegerminationoftheplanthost’sseeds( 11).", "We have recently described a protocol for the isolation of cryptococcal EVs through which the vesicles were obtained from solid fungal cultures ( 5). Although the general properties of fungal EVs obtained from solid cultures resembled those described for vesicles obtained from liquid media, a recent analysisoftheproteincompositionofcryptococcalEVsobtain ed fromsolidmediumrevealedimportantdiﬀerencesincomparison to those obtained in early studies using liquid cultures ( 12,13).", "This observation and the fact that culture conditions impact the composition of small molecules in H. capsulatum EVs (10) reinforce the importance of the compositional characterizat ion ofvesiclesobtainedfromsolidmedium.", "In this manuscript, we characterized the low mass components of EVs produced by C. gattii. The synthesis of some of the small molecules detected in the EVs revealed a vesicular peptide that protected an invertebrate host against a lethalchallengewith C.gattiiinadose-dependentfashion.These results indicate the existence of new venues of exploration o f the functions of EVs in fungal pathogens, and suggest that sma ll moleculesoffungalEVshaveimmunologicalpotential.", "RESULTS Small Molecule Characterization of C.gattii EVs C. gatti EV samples ( Figures1A,B ) were prepared as independent triplicates. EV extracts were analyzed by ultra- high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS), and the data submitted to molecular networking analysis in the Global Natural Produc t Social Molecular Networking (GNPS) platform, an interactive online small molecule–focused tandem mass spectrometry dat a curation and analysis infrastructure ( 14). Molecular networking using high-resolution MS/MS spectra allows the organization o f vesicular compounds in a visual representation ( 15,16). In this analysis,eachnodeislabeledbyaprecursormassandrepresen ts aMS/MSspectrumofacompound,andcompoundsofthesamemolecular family are grouped together, connected by arrows, forming clusters of similarity ( 15–18). Since the molecules can be identiﬁed in a database through their fragmentation patte rns and are represented in the molecular networking, the beneﬁts of this approach include fast dereplication, identiﬁcation of si milar compounds, and eﬀortless comparisons between diﬀerent metabolicproﬁlesorconditions( 16,17).", "The cluster-based molecular networking analysis revealed secondary metabolites present in the C. gattii EVs. The molecules detected in our analysis were classiﬁed as EV components if they were detected in the three replicates.", "Using this criterion, our small molecule analysis identiﬁe d 13 genuine components of the C. gattii EV samples ( Table1).", "This analysis revealed previously unknown components of EVs, includingpeptides,amino-acids,vitamins,andacarboxylice ster.", "The metabolites were identiﬁed through hits in the GNPS database ( SupplementaryFigures1–13 ) and corresponded to asperphenamate ( m/z507.2278), riboﬂavin ( m/z377.1456), and pantothenic acid ( m/z220.1181). The structures and MS data of the detected metabolites are shown in Figure1C ,Table1, respectively. The cluster-based molecular networking analy sis of theC.gattiiEVcomponentsisdetailedin Figure2.", "For validation of some key GNPS hits, we performed another round of spectrometric characterization of C. gattii small molecules including additional criteria as follows. We classiﬁedasauthenticEVcompoundsthosewhosestructurewas observedinEVextracts,butnotinmocksamples(extractedfr om sterile culture medium). Finally, these compounds obligator ily had chromatographic and spectrometric properties similar to those of synthetic standards. Due to the easiness in chemical synthesis and lack of detailed information in the literature, the linear dipeptides Phe-Pro, pyro-Glu-Ile, pyro- Glu-Pro, Leu-Pro, and pyro-Glu-Phe, and the tripeptide Ile- Pro-Ile were selected for the validation assays. We then searched for their presence in EV and mock extracts. The six peptides selected for chemical synthesis were classiﬁed as authentic EV components according to these criteria ( Table2).", "Indeed, this analysis revealed similar fragmentation patter ns and retention times for the vesicle peptides and the standard metabolites ( Figure3). The peptides exhibited typical fragments of protonated amino acids at m/z70.06, 86.09, 116.07, and 120.08 (SupplementaryFigure14 ).

NOP16 is a eukaryotic gene that is required for the activity of benzimidazoles against Cryptococcus deuterogattii .I nt h i ss t u d y , during the phenotypic characterization of C. deuterogattii mutants lacking NOP16 expression, we observed that this gene was required for EV production. Analysis of the small molecule composition of EVs produced by wild-type cells and two independent nop16 Dmutants revealed that the deletion of NOP16 resulted not only in a reduced number of EVs but also an altered small molecule composition. In a Galleria mellonella model of infection, the nop16 Dmutants were hypovirulent. The hypovirulent phenotype was reverted when EVs produced by wild-type cells, but not mutant EVs, were coinjected with the nop16 Dcells inG. mellonella . These results reveal a role for NOP16 in EV biogenesis and cargo, and also indicate that the composition of EVs is determinant for cryptococcal virulence. KEYWORDS Cryptococcus , extracellular vesicles, virulence Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are membranous structures produced by all domains of life (1). In microorganisms, EVs participate in processes of immunopathogenesis, cell to cell com- munication, cellular differentiation, and antimicrobial resistance, among others (reviewed inreference 2). Fungal EVs were ﬁrst characterized in the Cryptococcus g e n u s( 3 ) .I nt h i sm o d e l , EVs have immunostimulatory activity (4) and vaccinal potential (5). Cryptococcal EVs are also required for fungal virulence (6) and intraspecies communication (7).", "As widely discussed in the literature, several questions related to fungal EVs remain unanswered (8). The mechanisms of biogenesis of fungal EVs are still poorly known, whichimpairs the design of experimental models for the study of their functions. Although muchp r o g r e s sh a sb e e nm a d ei nt h ei d e n t i ﬁcation of the protein and nucleic acid components of fungal EVs (5, 9 –12), their small molecule composition was only recently addressed in C. deuterogattii (13), Penicillium digitatum (14), P. chrysogenum (15), and Histoplasma capsula- tum (16). In C. deuterogattii , small molecule analysis of EVs revealed the presence of a peptide controlling infection in the Galleria mellonella model (13). A possible relationship between small molecule composition and fungal virulence remains to be determined, as well as the genes regulating the formation of fungal EVs and their small molecule cargo. NOP16 is the gene encoding nucleolar protein 16. In humans, Nop16 is expressed in 237 different tissues (17), but its functions are poorly known.

There is no evidence in the literature pointing to the roles of Nop16 in the formation of EVs, although ribosomal proteins are abundant in cryptococcal EVs (5, 20). During the search for novel anti-cryptococcal agents, we found that Nop16 was involved in the antifungal activity of mebendazole by still unknown mechanisms (21). In this study, wereport on the generation and characterization of two independent mutants of C. deuterogattii lacking expression of Nop16. We found no connections between antifungal activity and Nop16 expression. However, in comparison with wild-type (WT) cells, the nop1 6Dmutants were hypovirulent in a G. mellonella model of infection, although they shared many phe- notypic properties with WT cells, including growth rates, ultrastructural features, capsuleformation, and susceptibility to phagocytosis. The nop1 6Dmutants were less ef ﬁcient in producing EVs, in association with an altered small molecule cargo. Infection of G. mello- nella with the nop1 6Dmutant strains in the presence of EVs produced by parental cells resulted in increased virulence, suggesting a role for NOP16 in EV biogenesis and cargo. These results also suggest that the composition of EVs can be determinant for the virulenceofC. deuterogattii . RESULTS Generation of the nop1 6Dmutants. We generated null mutants of the NOP16 (CNBG_3695) gene in C. deuterogattii by employing the Deslgate methodology, as previously described (22). NOP16 gene inactivation allele was performed by employing the vector pDONR-NAT (22). Ampli ﬁcation of the NOP16 gene ﬂanking regions and the internal frag- ment required the primers that are listed in Table 1. Two null mutants were identi ﬁed based on the absence of the ampli ﬁcation with diagnostic primers (Fig. 1A and B) and decreased sensitivity to mebendazole (Fig. 1C), based on the previously described association betweenthe antifungal activity of benzimidazoles and NOP16 expression (21). Phenotypic characterization of nop1 6D.1 and nop1 6D.2 mutant strains revealed a hypovirulent pro ﬁle.As part of our antifungal development program (21), we tested possible links between Nop16 and antifungal activity but did not ﬁnd any clear connection (data not shown). Nevertheless, we proceeded with the characterization of the mutants. Our tests included virulence potential in the G. mellonella model, determination of growth rates, observation of general cellular aspects, production of virulence factors, and characterizationof EVs, as follows below. Weﬁrst tested the virulence potential of the mutants by comparing their ability to killG. mellonella with that demonstrated by parental (WT) cells. Both mutants took longer than WT cells to kill the invertebrate host (Fig. 2; P ,0.0001). In the representative experi- ment (one out of three) that we describe in this study, all larvae were killed by WT cells onday 2 postinfection, while the mutants took 7 days to kill the whole G. mellonella population. Replicates produced similar results (data not shown).", "We asked why the nop1", "6D.1 and nop1 6D.2 mutant strains had reduced abilities to kill", "G. mellonella .T oa d d r e s st h i sq u e s t i o n ,w e ﬁrst determined the proliferation rates of the nop1 6D.1 and nop1 6D.2 mutants and compared them with those obtained for WT cells at 37°C in three different media.

Staining of the cell wall components chitin and chitoo- ligomers of WT and mutant strains revealed similar characteristics (Fig. 4A to C), which were in agreement with those reported in the literature (24). As for the capsular structures of C. deuterogattii , immuno ﬂuorescence analysis of parental and nop1 6D.1 and nop1 6D.2 cells using a monoclonal antibody to the main cryptococcal capsular component, namely, glucur- onoxylomannan (GXM), showed similar pro ﬁles of serological reactivity in all strains (Fig. 4A to C). The mutants tended to produce higher amounts of extracellular GXM, but the differen- ces were very discrete (Fig. 4D). The general similarity in the capsular structures was con- ﬁrmed by India ink counterstaining and no visual evidence of altered capsules was observed (Fig. 4E to G). We then determined the capsular dimensions in the three strains. Although the capsules of the mutants were statistically smaller than those of WT cells ( P,0.0001), the average values were very close (Fig. 4H). Scanning electron microscopy con ﬁrmed the immuno ﬂuorescence and counterstaining results, with no apparent differences between the capsules of WT and mutant cells (Fig. 4I to K). Because the susceptibility to phagocyto- sis, which also involves the participation of the cryptococcal capsule (25), is a determinantfor the pathogenesis of Cryptococcus ( 2 6 ) ,w ea l s oc o m p a r e dt h ep h a g o c y t i cr a t e so fW T and mutant strains. We found no signi ﬁcant differences between the phagocytic rates of WT and mutant cells by mouse macrophages (Fig. 4L). Altogether, these results led us tothe conclusion that the hypovirulent phenotypes of the nop1 6D.1 and nop1 6D.2 mutant strains were not related to evident cellular alterations, capsule formation, nor its possible interference with phagocytosis. We also tested melanin formation as another cryptococcalvirulence factor (27). Once again, WT and mutant strains had similar abilities to make pig- ments (data not shown).", "EV formation is affected in the nop1 6D.1 and nop1 6D.2 mutant strains.

The genes regulating formation of fungal EVs are not well known, but in Saccharomyces cerevisiae , EV production was in ﬂuenced by the func- tionality of Golgi-related secretory proteins (28). Therefore, we analyzed the Golgi of WT and mutant strains after staining the cells with C6-NBD-ceramide (29).", "FIG 3 Analysis of growth rates (A to C) and ultrastructural aspects (D to F) of wild type (WT) and mutant cells lacking Nop16 ( nop1 6D.1 and nop1 6D.2 strains). Independently on the use of Sabouraud (A), YPD (B), or RPMI (C) as the growth media, the mutant strains always manifested higher proliferati on rates, in comparison to WT cells.

WT cells showed the typical pattern of disperse Golgi staining previously observed in C. neoformans (30, 31) (Fig. 5A).

These results were suggestive that NOP16 deletion somehow resulted in defects in the Golgi. We then asked whether EV for- mation was also altered in nop16 Dcells.", "To address this question, we isolated EVs from WT and mutant cells for characterization by TEM and nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) (Fig. 6A). TEM revealed that WT and mutant cells produced EVs with their typical morphological aspects, including cup-shaped structures and bilayered membranes. NTA demonstrated that in the three strains, the EV population was mainly distributed in the 100- to 300-nm range, as extensively observed for theCryptococcus genus (5, 32, 33). Minor populations in the 300- to 600-nm range were also observed in the three strains. However, the quanti ﬁcation of EVs produced by the three strains by NTA revealed a signi ﬁcantly reduced formation of vesicles in the mutant strains (Fig. 6B). After normalization of the number of EVs in each sample to the number of EV-pro- ducing cells, the nop1 6D.1 mutant was approximately twice less ef ﬁcient than WT cells to produce EVs, while EV production was approximately 3-fold higher in the parental strain than in the nop1 6D.2 mutant. In an attempt to validate this observation, we measured FIG 4 Analysis of the role of Nop16 in the surface architecture of C. deuterogattii and its impact on fungal phagocytosis. Fluorescence microscopy analysis of the cell surface of WT (A), nop1 6D.1 (B), and nop1 6D.2 (C) cells revealed similar aspects of cell wall chitin (blue ﬂuorescence), chitooligomers (green ﬂuorescence), and the capsule (red ﬂuorescence) in the three strains. GXM secretion tended to be higher in the nop1 6D.1 mutant ( **,P= 0.0053), but not the nop1 6D.2 strain (D; ns, not signi ﬁcant). India ink counterstaining of WT (E), nop1 6D.1 (F), and nop1 6D.2 (G) cells suggested similar capsular dimensions, but the determination of the capsule sizes revealed lower average values for the mutant cells (H, ****,P,0.0001, with a 95% con ﬁdence level of 95.61%). SEM was also used for the observation of the capsules of WT (I), nop1 6D.1 (J), and nop1 6D.2 (K) cells, revealing similar capsular structures. The phagocytosis rates of the three strains by mouse macrophages were also determined (L). No signi ﬁcant (ns) differences between the three strains were observed.NOP16, Vesicle Formation and Virulence in Cryptococcus Infection and Immunity Month YYYY Volume XX Issue XX 10.1128/iai.00232-22 5 Downloaded from https://journals.asm.org/journal/iai on 19 July 2022 by 157.86.94.14. extracellular urease activity in the three strains, because this enzyme is an extracellular vir- ulence factor exported in EVs (20). Urease activity was signi ﬁcantly smaller in mutant cells, in comparison with the enzyme activity measured in the parental strain (Fig. 6C). NOP16 deletion affects the small molecule composition of EVs. The reduced formation of EVs in the nop1 6D.1 and nop1 6D.2 mutant strains suggested a role for Nop16 in EV bio- genesis. Because EV biogenesis involves the mechanisms of cargo (34), we also asked whetherthe composition of EVs was altered after NOP16 deletion. As a proof of concept, we focused our analysis on the 13 EV small molecules that we recently described in C. deuterogattii (13) because this number was much smaller than those found for proteins (5) and RNA (9) in cryp-tococcal vesicles. Of the 13 previously described small molecule components of cryptococcalEVs, two were below the detection level (Val-Leu-Pro-Val-Pro and asperphenamate) in thisstudy, so we concentrated our analysis on the remaining 11 compounds. To compare thesmall molecule composition of EVs from WT and mutant cells, we used the partial leastsquare discriminant analysis (PLS-DA). This analysis allows the comparison of data, includingseveral variables under an algorithm-supervised mode, as is the case of mass spectrometry (MS) data. Different chemical pro ﬁles of small molecule composition of EVs from WT and mutant cells were found (Fig. 7). As anticipated, the composition of the EVs from thenop1 6D.1 and nop1 6D.2 mutant strains was similar. However, EV composition in WT cells was clearly different from that observed in mutant vesicles. Three of the annotatedmetabolites were classi ﬁed as variables important in the projection (VIPs) identi ﬁed by PLS-DA, namely, Phe-Pro, Pyro Glu-Leu, and Cyclo (Tyr-Pro). They were used for the dis-crimination between the three groups (small molecule composition of EVs produced byWT, nop1 6D.1, and nop1 6D.2 cells). These results proved the concept that deletion of Nop16 affected EV formation in C. deuterogattii .", "EVs from parental cells increase the virulence of the nop1 6Dmutant cells. Given that the EVs were altered under conditions of interrupted Nop16 expression, we askedwhether the vesicles were the elements required for virulence in the nop1 6D.1 and nop1 6D.2 mutant strains. We raised two hypotheses. First, the hypovirulent pro ﬁle of the mutants could be a result of the reduced number of EVs. Second, the altered composition of EVs would be responsible for the hypovirulent phenotypes. To address these hypotheses,we returned to the G. mellonella model of infection using the nop1 6D.2 mutant, in which the formation of EVs was more evidently reduced. To test whether reduced EV concentra-tions would be the reason for the hypovirulence, we infected G. mellonella with nop1 6D.2 cells supplementing the injecting suspension with EVs produced by this mutant strain. Theamount of EVs added to this suspension was calculated on the basis that this mutant was3-fold less effective in producing EVs than WT cells. Therefore, for each cryptococcal cell FIG 5 Cell wall (calco ﬂuor white, CFW) and Golgi staining (C6-NBD-Cer) in WT and mutant cells. (A) Microscopic examination of stained fungal cells suggested reduced levels of Golgi staining in mutant cells.

Independently on the presence of the EVs produced by the mutant strain, all larvae died by day 8 postinfec- tion, and no signi ﬁcant differences were observed between systems injected with EVs plus the mutant or those receiving the mutant strain only (Fig. 8; P= 0.5488). We then speculated that the number of EVs was likely not determinant for pathogenesis. To test whether the composition of EVs in ﬂuenced virulence, we injected G. mellonella with the nop1 6D.2 strain in the presence of EVs produced by WT cells, using the same ratio of three EVs for each cryptococcal cell used for infection. In comparison with systems receiving no EVs or EVs from mutant cells, a clearly accelerated death curve wasobserved when G. mellonella was injected with the nop1 6D.2 mutant in the presence of EVs produced by WT cells (Fig. 8; P= 0.0007).", "DISCUSSION In this study, our results connected the NOP16 gene with EV biogenesis in C. deuterogattii , as concluded from the observation that the mutant strains with defective Nop16 expression FIG 6 Analysis of the impact of NOP16 deletion on EV formation in C. deuterogattii .

A role for a nucleolar protein in EV biogenesis might sound illogical atﬁrst sight. However, ribosomal proteins are major components of fungal EVs (5, 20). According to the recently launched ExVe tool for analysis of fungal EVs (35), at least 82 ribosomal proteinsare present in C. deuterogattii EVs, with 17 of them being directly associated with the 60S ribo- somal subunit. These results might have a relationship with the observation that, in S. cerevi- siae, Nop16 was required for the biogenesis of the 60S ribosomal subunit (18, 19). If Nop16 plays a similar role in C. deuterogattii , its defective expression is expected to induce an altered EV cargo. To prove this concept, we analyzed the small molecule composition of C. deuter- FIG 7 Multivariate data analysis of small molecule composition in WT and mutant cells of C. deuterogattii lacking expression of NOP16 ( nop1 6D.1 and nop1 6D.2 strains) based on LC-MS data.

Animals infected with the nop1 6D.2 mutant alone or the mutant in the presence of their own EVs had similar mortality rates ( P= 0.5488). In contrast, infection of G. mellonella with the nop1 6D.2 mutant in the presence of EVs produced by WT cells resulted in higher mortality rates in comparisonwith all other systems infected with the nop1 6D.2 mutant of C. deuterogattii (P= 0.0007).

Other compo- nents, however, were not analyzed.", "Our results indicated a connection between regular EV production and cryptococcal viru- lence. In this sense, it is noteworthy that the current literature indicates that EVs play puzzling roles in cryptococcal pathogenesis. These structures were denominated “virulence bags ”due to their complex composition that includes several virulence factors (20), which agrees with studies suggesting that cryptococcal EVs function in favor of disease progress. For instance, C. neoformans EVs facilitated cryptococcal traversal across the blood-brain barrier in mice, promoting an enhanced infection of the brain (36). An RNAi mutant strain of C. neoformans lacking expression of Sec6, a gene regulating conventional secretion, had attenuated viru- l e n c ei nm i c ei na s s o c i a t i o nw i t ht h ea b s e n c eo fE Vf o r m a t i o n( 3 7 ) .M o r er e c e n t l y ,l o n g - d i s - tance communication via EVs was demonstrated to be essential for the virulence of C. deu- terogattii (6). One additional factor that may be related to the connection between EVs and virulence is urease. The role of urease in fungal virulence was well established in C. neofor- mans and Coccidioides posadasii (38), and its activity in cryptococcal EVs was demonstrated in early studies (20). It remains unknown whether the effect of NOP16 deletion on urease ac- tivity was direct or if it derived from the misfunctioning of other cellular structures, but our results support the supposition that Nop16 expression, EV production, urease activity, and virulence are somehow connected in Cryptococcus . It remains unknown if these connections occur in other fungi, but C. posadasii is a natural candidate for this type of investigation. Paradoxically, several studies indicate that cryptococcal EVs stimulate disease control. EVs stimulated the antifungal activity of macrophages in association with nitric oxide and cytokine production (4). In addition, EVs enriched with sterylglucosides induced protection against C. neoformans in a G. mellonella model of infection (39). Similarly, an EV peptide produced byC. deuterogattii induced the control of animal mortality in the same model (13). In mice, exposure to EVs produced by an acapsular strain of C. neoformans resulted in attenuated disease (5), which agrees with reports in the C. albicans model (40). The versatility of EVs in cryptococcal pathogenesis was ef ﬁciently illustrated in a recent study that demonstrated that vesicle properties changed according to the growth condition (41). EVs produced under a poor nutritional condition contained more virulence compounds, and induced a more ro- bust in ﬂammatory pattern than those produced in a rich nutritional medium. On the other hand, EVs produced in a rich medium inhibited the expression of genes related to the inﬂammasome, suggesting an involvement of EVs in the pathogenic process (41). We dem- onstrated recently that cryptococcal EVs are highly diverse in their physical-chemical proper- ties, suggesting that their functions can indeed show a high diversity (33). Our results suggest that an altered composition of EVs can result in attenuated viru- lence, as concluded from the observation that EVs produced by WT cells restored, at least partially, the virulence of a mutant strain lacking expression of Nop16. On the ba- sis of the previous reports demonstrating that EVs contribute to the pathogenic poten- tial of Cryptococcus (6, 20, 36, 37, 41), we speculate that the hypovirulent phenotype of thenop16 Dmutants could be a result of altered EV production. Our results suggested that increasing the concentration of EVs was not suf ﬁcient to restore the pathogenic potential of the nop16 Dmutants because the mortality of G. mellonella did not change in the presence of an increased amount of EVs produced by these cells. In contrast, infection with the mutant cells in the presence of EVs produced by the parental cells resulted in an increased pathogenic potential. These results strongly suggest that EV cargo is determinant for the ability of C. deuterogattii to kill G. mellonella . One limita- tion of our study comes from the lack of knowledge of the EV components impacting virulence, because it is very likely that the composition of the vesicles produced by the nop16 Dmutants was altered at multiple levels, and not only in the small molecule cargo. Regardless, these results might represent a proof of concept that EV formation is connected to virulence through their composition. Future studies identifying bioac- tive EV components and determining their vesicular concentration will be necessary for the characterization of the molecules impacting infection, as recently described for the Ile-Pro-Ile tripeptide (13). However, we anticipate that this might be a complexNOP16, Vesicle Formation and Virulence in Cryptococcus Infection and Immunity Month YYYY Volume XX Issue XX 10.1128/iai.00232-22 9 Downloaded from https://journals.asm.org/journal/iai on 19 July 2022 by 157.86.94.14. analysis because we cannot anticipate whether a molecular association between differ- ent vesicle components will be required for fungal virulence.", "MATERIALS AND METHODS Strains. Fungal strains were maintained on Sabouraud agar plates (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 4% dextrose, and 1.5% agar) grown at 30°C for 24 h and stored at 4°C. Twenty-four hours before the experiments, the strains were transferred to liquid YPD medium (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, and 2% dextrose) and incubated at 30°C for 24 h with shaking (200 rpm). In experiments where capsule induc-tion was necessary, the cells underwent an extra step of incubation in the capsule induction medium (10% Sabouraud diluted in MOPS 50 mM, pH 7.4) (42) for 24 h at 37°C and 5% CO", "2. For the GXM detec-", "tion assay by ELISA, cells grown in YPD were submitted to an incubation step in RPMI (37°C, 5% CO2for 24 h) before the collection of the supernatants. The Delsgate methodology was used to construct the NOP16 gene inactivation allele by employing the vector pDONR-NAT, as described previously (22). Primers used to amplify the NOP16 gene ﬂanking regions, as well as the internal fragment, are listed in Table 1. For the con ﬁrmation of NOP16 deletion, the strains were cultured in YPD for 24 h with shaking (200 rpm). The cells were washed with fresh YPD and counted in a hemacytometer. A total of 500,000cells were inoculated into fresh YPD in the absence (control) or presence of mebendazole (1 mM) in a 96-well plate. After incubation for 24 h at 30°C, the OD600 was determined and the relative growth was determined by the ratio of optical densities in the presence of mebendazole by the control condition.For determination of growth rates, WT and mutant strains were grown in Sabouraud broth overnight at 30°C with shaking (200 rpm). The cultures were washed three times with PBS and counted in a Neubauer chamber. The cells were suspended (2.5 /C210", "5cells/mL) in liquid Sabouraud, YPD, or Roswell Park Memorial Institute", "(RPMI) medium supplemented with 1% glucose, buffered (pH 7.0), with 165 mM morpholinepropanesulfonic acid (MOPS). Each suspension (200 mL, triplicates) was placed onto the wells of 96-well plates and incubated at 37°C on a Molecular Devices SpectraMax Paradigm microplate reader. Fungal growth was determined with op- tical density measurements at 530 nm every hour for 48 h.", "Ultrastructure of C. deuterogattii .For the analysis of possible cellular alterations resulting from NOP16 deletion, fungal cells were processed for TEM (32). The cells were ﬁxed in 4% paraformaldehyde and 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer, pH 7.2 for 1 h at room temperature. The ﬁxed sam- ples were washed three times with cacodylate buffer by centrifugation (5,000 /C2gfor 2 min). The pellet was treated with 1% osmium tetroxide and 5 mM potassium ferrocyanide diluted in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer (1:1 ratio) for 1 h at room temperature. The samples were then washed three times with cacodyl-ate buffer and then sequentially dehydrated with 30%, 50%, 70%, 90%, and twice with 100% acetone. In each step, the samples were incubated with acetone for 30 min. The cell pellet was covered with the EMbed 812 resin (EMS) diluted in acetone. The initial dilution was one part resin to two parts 100% ace-tone, and this proportion was changed daily for 3 days (one part resin to one part acetone on the sec- ond day; two parts resin to one part acetone on the third day). On the fourth day, the solution was replaced with 100% resin. This process was repeated, and the cell pellet covered with resin was incu- bated at 60°C for 48 h until complete polymerization of the resin was achieved. Ultrasections were pre- pared with an ultramicrotome (Leica EM UC6; thickness of 70 to 80 nm) and mounted on microscopicgrids. The observation of the samples was performed using a JEOL 1400Plus microscope with an acceler- ation of 90 kV. The images were obtained using a digital camera with an 8-megapixel CCD coupled to the equipment.", "Analysis of the polysaccharide capsule. Fungal cells were ﬁrst counterstained with India ink for vis- ualization of the capsule by light microscopy. As the polysaccharide structure is not permeable to India ink, counterstaining generates a high-contrast zone that allows the capsular structure to be visualized. C. deuterogattii cells were incubated in 10% Sabouraud in 50 mM morpholinopropanesulfonic acid", "2. After capsule induction, the cells were recovered by centrifuga-", "tion at 3,000 /C2g,w a s h e dw i t hP B S ,a n d ﬁxed with 4% paraformaldehyde. The cell suspension (3 mL) was placed onto a glass slide and supplemented with 2 mL of Indian ink. The sample was ﬁnally covered with a glass cover- slip and observed with an inverted microscope (Leica DMi8). The images obtained in this process were analyzedusing the ImageJ software (NIH). The capsule size was estimated as the cell body diameter subtracted from the total capsule diameter. For serological detection of capsular GXM, cryptococcal cells grown in YPD for 24 h were centrifuged and the cell pellet washed with PBS. The cells were transferred to the capsule induction mediumunder the conditions described above. The cells were then centrifuged at 3,000 /C2gfor 3 min and the pellet was washed three times with sterile PBS. The cells were suspended in 150 mL of 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. After ﬁxation, the cell suspension was centrifuged again at 3,000 /C2g for 3 min. The cell pellet was subjected to three washes with PBS and blocked with 1 mL of blocking buffer (1% BSA in PBS), followed by incubation for 1 h at 37°C. The suspension was centrifuged, the supernatant was dis-carded and 150 mLo f2 5 mMc a l c o ﬂuor was added to the cell pellet, followed by incubation for 30 min at 37°C. Then, three washes were performed with PBS and 120 mL of an anti-GXM antibody 18B7 (donated by Arturo C a s a d e v a l l ,J o h n sH o p k i n sU n i v e r s i t y ,B a l t i m o r e ,U S A )a t1 0 mg/mL in blocking buffer added to the cell suspen- sion for a subsequent incubation for 1 h at 37°C.

The cells were incubated for 1 h in the dark at room temperature. The cells were washed again with PBS and stained with ﬂuorescein-isothiocyanate (FITC) labeled wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) for detection of chitin oligomers in the cell wall (24).

The cells were washed three times with a post ﬁxative solution (0.2 M sucrose, 0.1 M sodium caco- dylate buffer, 2 mM MgCl2). The washed samples (150 mL) were allowed to adhere to 0.01% poly-L-lysine (type I)-coated coverslips for 30 min at room temperature. The coverslips were sequentially dehydratedwith 30%, 50%, and 70% ethanol solutions (5 min for each concentration), followed by 90% ethanol and two rounds of 100% ethanol, with these three steps lasting 10 min each. The cells were dried on a critical point chamber (Leica EM CPD300) and coated with gold particles on a metallizer (Leica EM ACE200). Thevisualization of the samples was performed using a JEOL JSM-6010 Plus/LA microscope with an accelera-tion of 5 kV. Golgi staining. We followed the protocol originally described by Pagano et al. (29) and adapted by our group to the analysis of the Golgi in cryptococci (30, 31). Brie ﬂy, yeast cells (10 7) were ﬁxed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, followed by washing with PBS and incubation with C6-NBD-ceramide (10 mM) for 16 h at 4°C. The cells were then incubated with fetal calf serum (10%) at 4°C for 1 h to remove theexcess of C6-NBD-ceramide. The cell wall was stained with calco ﬂuor white (0.1 mg/mL) for 30 min at room temperature, followed by washing with PBS and analysis by ﬂuorescence microscopy as previously described (30, 31). Virtually all cells were ef ﬁciently stained with calco ﬂuor white, and the percentage of cells giving positive signals for C6-NBD-ceramide-derived ﬂuorescence was manually determined in pop- ulations of 100 cells for each tested condition.", "Isolation of EVs. The isolation of EVs produced by mutant and WT C. deuterogattii cells followed our recently described protocol (32). Fungal cultures had their cell densities determined in aNeubauer chamber and adjusted to 3.5 /C210", "7cells/mL. Aliquots of each inoculum (300 mL) were", "spread with a Drigalski loop onto Petri dishes containing 25 mL of solid YPD. Three plates per strainwere used. The plates were incubated at 30°C for 24 h to reach con ﬂuence, and then the fungal cells were recovered by gently scraping with an inoculation loop, and transferred to a centrifugetube containing 30 mL of sterile PBS. Sequential centrifugation was used to remove the cells. In the ﬁrst centrifugation step, the samples were centrifuged at 5,000 /C2gfor 15 min at 4°C. The superna- tants from the ﬁrst centrifugation step were transferred to sterile tubes. These tubes were submit- ted to a second centrifugation step at 15,000 /C2gfor 15 min at 4°C, for sedimentation of the cellular debris. After this step, the supernatants were ﬁltered through 0.45 mm membranes and ultracentri- fuged at 100,000 /C2gfor 1 h at 4°C. The pelleted EVs were suspended in a ﬁnal volume of 300 mLo f PBS and stored at 4°C.", "Quanti ﬁcation and morphological analysis of EVs. The quanti ﬁcation of EVs was performed by NTA using LM10 nanoparticle analysis system coupled to a 488-nm laser, equipped with a camera andﬂow pump (Malvern Panalytical, Malvern, United Kingdom) and the NTA 3.0 software (Malvern Panalytical) (32). The samples were diluted 200-fold in PBS to achieve the optimal readout range of 9 /C210 particles/mL. The samples were injected with 1-mL syringes attached to a continuous ﬂow injection pump. Three 60-s videos (camera level at 15, gain at 3) were obtained per sample after the passage of the samplesthrough the light beam. The viscosity of the samples was indicated as the same as that of water. For data anal-ysis, the camera gain was changed to 10 to 15 and the detection limit used was three for all samples. TEM was used to visualize the EVs (32). The samples were homogenized with a vortex for 2 min to break up possible aggregates. The EV suspensions (50 mL) were adhered to Formvar-coated grids for 60 min at room tempera- ture. The grids were then washed with 30 mL sterile PBS. The excess buffer was removed by applying ﬁlter pa- per to the bottom of each grid. The grids were then incubated with 30 mL of the Karnowski solution for 10 min, washed three times with cacodylate buffer, and ﬁnally dried with ﬁlter paper. The samples were counter- stained with 5% uranyl acetate for 2 min. The grids were washed once with H2O, dried with ﬁlter paper, and transferred to a metallizer (Leica EM ACE200), where they were covered with carbon particles for later visualiza-tion with a JEOL 1400Plus microscope with beam acceleration at 90 kV.

To assess the pathogenic potential of the WT and mutant strains, the inver- tebrate model of infection in G. mellonella , which was validated for the study of cryptococcal pathogenesis (45), was used. For acclimatization, G. mellonella larvae weighing between 0.10 and 0.15 g were divided into groups of 15 animals in Petri dishes and incubated overnight at 37°C before infection. Suspensions containing 1/C2108cells/mL were prepared in sterile PBS for each of the strains to be analyzed. Then, 10 mL of these sus- pensions, containing 1 /C2106fungi, were used to infect the larvae of G. mellonella using a Hamilton syringe as previously described (13). The plates were then incubated at 37°C to monitor the survival of the animals overthe days. The groups analyzed were: (i) animals infected with the WT, R265 strain; (ii) animals infected with the nop16 D.1 mutant strain; (iii) animals infected with the mutant strain nop16 D.2; and (iv) control group inocu- lated only with PBS. Larvae mortality was observed daily, as evidenced by the lack of movement after stimula-tion with forceps. G. mellonella mortality was also the model used to evaluate the role of EVs on fungal pathogenesis. In these assays, all infection conditions were similar to those described above. However, we only used thenop1 6D.2 mutant, based on its lower ability to produce EVs. Six groups were analyzed, including noninfected controls (larvae injected with [i] PBS alone, [ii] EVs from WT cells, or [iii] EVs from the nop1 6D.2 mutant) and infected systems (infection with [i] nop1 6D.2 cells alone, [ii] nop1 6D.2 cells with EVs from WT cells, or [iii] the nop1 6D.2 mutant with its own EVs). The amount of externally supplemented EVs corresponded to three vesicles per each of the 1 /C210 6fungi used to infect G. mellonella . Monitoring of mortality was performed as described above.", "Small molecule analysis. C. deuterogattii EVs were prepared and analyzed as recently described by our group (13, 14).

C. auris infections are worrisome because the fungus is often resistant to multiple antifungal drug classes. Furthermore, C. auris forms durable and difﬁcult to remove bioﬁlms. Due to the relatively recent, resilient, and resistant nature of C. auris , we investigated whether it produces the common fungal virulence factor melanin. Melanin is a black-brown pigment typically produced following enzymatic oxidation of aromatic precursors, which promotes fungal virulence through oxidative stress resistance, mammalian immune response evasion, and antifungal peptide and pharmaceutical inactivation. We found that certain strains of C. auris oxidized L-DOPA and catecholamines into melanin. Melanization occurred extracellularly in a process mediated by alkalinization of the extracellular environment, resulting in granule-like structures that adhere to the fungus’ external surface. C. auris had relatively high cell surface hydrophobicity, but there was no correlation between hydrophobicity and melanization. Melanin protected the fungus from oxidative damage, but we did not observe a protective role during infection of macrophages or Galleria mellonella larvae. In summary, C. auris alkalinizes the extracellular medium, which promotes the non-enzymatic oxidation of L-DOPA to melanin that attaches to its surface, thus illustrating a novel mechanism for fungal melanization.", "Keywords: melanin; Candida auris ; alkalinization; ammonia; hydrophobicity; virulence", "1. Introduction", "Candida auris is an emerging fungal pathogen that is believed to have originated in marine wetlands and marshes [ 1,2].C. auris was ﬁrst described in a clinical setting in 2009, but patient samples as early as 1996 have been retrospectively determined to be C. auris [3–5]. Since its discovery, C. auris has caused outbreaks in at least 47 countries [ 3]. C. auris is often acquired in healthcare settings and is believed to cause infections via J. Fungi 2022 ,8, 1068. https://doi.org/10.3390/jof8101068 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/jof bioﬁlms formed on medical equipment such as intravenous catheters, leading to blood- stream infection (candidemia) and dissemination to organs [ 6]. The emergence of C. auris as a human fungal pathogen is particularly concerning due to its remarkably high resistance to known antifungal therapies. This pathogen displays especially high resistance to azole and echinocandin classes of antifungal drugs [ 3,7], posing a major concern for clinicians treating fungal infections, since many of the commonly used and most efﬁcacious antifun- gal therapeutics belong to these two drug classes. Hence, a deeper understanding of the physical properties of C. auris and how they contribute to virulence is urgently needed. One unexplored aspect of C. auris physiology is whether it can produce the viru- lence factor melanin. Other Candida species, such as C. albicans and C. glabrata, produce this virulence factor [ 8–11]. Melanin is a black-brown, insoluble, acid-resistant pigment found throughout a plethora of life forms, and it has particular importance in the con- text of fungal virulence in mammals [ 12,13]. In fungi, melanin is typically produced through either the oxidation of catecholamines (DOPA melanin), the Tyrosine degradation pathway (pyomelanin), or polyketide synthase pathways (DHN melanin) [ 12]. Genes controlling melanization are affected by temperature, nutrient stress, and copper/metal ion concentration [14–16]; the biochemical processes can also be altered by the environmental antioxidant balance and pH [ 17,18]. Melanin is formed either within the cell in organelles termed “melanosomes” and then exported to the cell wall, or in the cell wall itself [ 19,20]. Once located within the cell wall, the pigment can be anchored through interactions with chitin, chitosan, and other cell wall components [ 9,21–23]. In some melanizing fungi such asC. neoformans, melanin interacts strongly with polysaccharides, lipids, and proteins, many of which are still intact following boiling in acid, lipid extraction, and enzymatic degradation. These fungi are thought to use such molecules as a scaffold for melanin deposition in the cell wall [ 19,24,25]. This melanin can also be released from the cell wall, as seen in C. neoformans, where melanin granules are shed into the extracellular space during cell wall remodeling and can be recovered from the supernatant [19,26].", "Functionally, fungal melanin pigments have strong antioxidant properties that allow them to resist oxidative damage caused by the host immune cells, such as macrophage and neutrophil oxidative bursts [ 27]. Additionally, melanin can bind and inactivate an- timicrobial peptides and antimicrobial enzymes that the host typically uses to degrade and kill fungi during infection, as well as antifungal drugs used to treat infections [ 28–30]. Fungal melanins located in the cell wall can alter cell wall composition and physically mask pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) that would otherwise be recog- nized and bound by pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs). These changes may lead to diminished recognition by host immune cells. Conversely, one subtype of melanin—DHN melanin—can be recognized by the melanin sensing C-type lectin (MelLec) receptor, which is part of the human innate immune response and can enhance fungal clearance [ 31]. Melanin could also be presented to lymphocytes in a stimulatory context, which results in melanin-speciﬁc antibody production, which can inevitably lead to fungal opsonization, phagocytosis, and complement deposition [28,32,33].", "In this study, we investigated the ability of 18 C. auris strains to produce melanin. The presence of melanin was conﬁrmed through detection of a stable free-radical structure via electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, a characteristic feature of this group of pigments. Like other fungi, we found that C. auris produces a black melanin pigment, which was located on the surface of the cell wall. However, we found that, unlike other fungi, the melanization occurs extracellularly, in the supernatant. In liquid culture, the cell-free melanin can adhere to the surface of the cell and cause pigmentation of the fungus. Next, we found this process to be mediated by the ability of C. auris to neutralize the pH of the media it is grown in, resulting in enhanced autoxidation of the L-DOPA and catecholamine melanin substrates. This method of melanin production differs greatly from what is reported in other fungi. Lastly, we evaluated the functional properties of C. auris melanin, ﬁnding that it protected the fungus from oxidative stress and reduced cell surface hydrophobicity but was not protective in vitro in the context of interactions with macrophages, or in an in vivo challenge of Galleria mellonella larvae. Further studies are required to identify the unique features of C. auris that make it particularly resistant to antifungal therapeutics.", "2. Materials and Methods", "2.1. Candida auris Strains and Media", "All isolates of Candida auris strains were received from the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention Food and Drug Administration Antimicrobial Resistance Isolate Bank [ 34] with the exceptions of MMC1 and MMC2, which were previously described clinical isolates [ 35]. CDC 381 is also known as B11220, CDC 387 is also known as B8441, and CDC 388 is also known as B11098. All C. auris strains were ﬁrst grown in Yeast Peptone Dextrose (YPD) broth at 30\u000eC until they reached stationary phase. Cultures were washed twice and put into Minimal Media (15.0 mM glucose, 10.0 mM MgSO 4, 29.4 mM KH 2PO4, 13.0 mM glycine, 3.0 M vitamin B 1, pH 5.5) at 37\u000eC at 107cells/mL unless otherwise noted. Cells were grown for 7 days under continuous shaking.", "2.2. C. auris Melanization in Liquid Media", "AllC. auris strains were grown in minimal media as described above, with the addition of melanin precursors to be tested. All compounds used for the melanization substrate assay and ABTS (2,20-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) laccase assay were prepared in concentrated stock solutions and added to the culture at a ﬁnal concentration of 1 mM except for caspofungin, which was added at 0.5 \u0016g/mL ﬁnal concentration. For the experiments evaluating the temperature dependence of the C. auris strain melanization, cultures were also grown at 30\u000eC for 7 days in minimal media. After 7 d, cultures were scanned with a CanoScan9000F scanner at 600 dpi. Mean Gray Value for each well of culture was determined using the Measure tool on FIJI image processing software [36]. For experiments where cultures were grown on solid agar petri dishes, 20 \u0016L of stationary washed culture were added to minimal media agar with 1 mM of L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA). Plates were incubated at 37\u000eC for 7 days and imaged with a CanoScan9000F scanner at 600 dpi.", "2.3. Melanin Extraction and Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR)", "Stable free-radicals, a hallmark feature of melanin, can be detected through electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR). The ability to detect stable free-radicals lends to EPR’s use- fulness as a technique to characterize and identify melanin pigments. Melanin was extracted from selected strains of C. auris and one strain of C. neoformans (H99) as described [37]. Brieﬂy, after growing for 7 days in minimal medium containing L-DOPA (1 mM), cells were washed with sorbitol/sodium citrate solution and incubated with Novozyme 234 for 1 h at 30\u000eC. Samples were incubated with guanidine thiocyanate for 1 h, followed by an incubation with 6 M HCl. After boiling the solution for 1 h, the pellets were washed and suspended in PBS. Extracted melanin was examined using a Varian E112 X-Band model spectrometer with a TE102 resonator and a liquid nitrogen ﬁnger Dewar vessel to obtain EPR spectra of the collected dark particles suspended in PBS and frozen with liquid nitrogen. The EPR runs were performed with the following parameters that were standard- ized for our fungal melanin studies as described previously [ 8]: modulation frequency of 9.07 GHz, modulation amplitude of 1.6 G, center ﬁeld of 3250.0 G, sweep width of 100.0 G, microwave frequency of 9.1 GHz, microwave power of 1.0 mW, time constant of 0.5 s, and temperature of 77 K.", "2.4.

The supernatant was removed and sterilized through a 0.8 \u0016m syringe ﬁlter (Corning, Corning, NY, USA). To measure the melanization of the supernatant, absorbance measurements were performed at 492 nm using a SpectraMax iD5 spectrophotometer. For experiments collecting and analyzing the extracellular melanin particles, the supernatants were then ultracentrifuged at 100,000 \u0002gfor 1 h at 4\u000eC in a Beckman Coulter Optima L-90K UltraCentrifuge. Supernatants were decanted, and the melanized pellet was suspended in PBS.", "2.5. Supernatant Melanization Activity", "To assess phenoloxidase activity of the supernatant, L-DOPA was added to cell-free supernatant from non-melanized cultures. Subsequently, the supernatant was left to in- cubate for 72 h at 37\u000eC in darkness. Activity was determined through SpectraMax iD5 spectrophotometer readings at 492 nm taken at 0 and 72 h, and images were taken using a CanoScan9000F ﬂatbed scanner at a resolution of 600 dpi. For the proteinase assays, supernatants were pre-treated with 1:10 Trypsin (Corning) at 37\u000eC, or with approxi- mately 200 \u0016g/mL Proteinase K (New England BioLabs) at 60\u000eC prior to the addition of L-DOPA. To measure the degree of protection conferred by extracellular vesicles against degradation of potential melanin-producing components, supernatants were pre-treated with 0.01% w/vSDS or 0.1% v/vTriton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) with or without Proteinase K. Supernatants were then incubated for one hour at 60\u000eC as described.

To verify the ability of C. auris to take up and utilize exogenous GlcNAc for chitin synthesis, an additional culture of CDC 388 cells was prepared in growth medium supplemented with 5 mM15N-enriched GlcNAc. The cells from all cultures were harvested via centrifugation, and the resulting pellets were resuspended in 25 mL deionized water. To heat-kill the cells, the tubes containing these cell suspensions were immersed in a water bath at 65\u000eC for 1 h. When cooled to room temperature, the heat-killed cells were centrifuged at 3,700 rpm for 30 min at 4\u000eC.

In addition, the single representative of Clade V—associated with Iran—melanized, but the lack of additional Clade V isolates for testing hinders the generalization of this ﬁnding. The antifungal drug susceptibility (Minimum Inhibitory Concentrations) of the melanin-producing strains as a whole was generally higher than the susceptibility of non- melanin-producing strains as a whole (Supplementary Figure S1), as reported by the CDC and FDA Antibiotic Resistance Isolate Bank [ 34].

Stable free radicals can be detected by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), making this biophysical technique the ‘gold standard’ for the identiﬁcation of melanin pigments. Melanin from 7-day cultures was extracted from 12 strains of C. auris and analyzed by EPR, where melanin extracted from C. neoformans H99 was used as a stan- dard (Figure 1D–F). The EPR spectra from the non-melanizing strains did not display the melanin-distinctive EPR peak (Figure 1E), but the EPR spectra from the pigment extracted from the melanin-producing strains (Figure 1F) was similar to the C. neoformans melanin proﬁle (Figure 1D).", "3.3.

C. neoformans was also cultured under the same conditions and compared to the C. auris melanization proﬁle. Melanin production was optimal by cells in high density (107cells/mL). In this condition, melanin was visible from day 3, and intensiﬁed over a period of days, reaching its peak between days 7 and 10. Some strains melanized in a delayed fashion when grown at a medium cell density (106cells/mL), whereas none of the low-density (105cell/mL) cultures produced visible pigment.

These electron-dense structures are likely to be melanin that appeared to be rounded and granular. The extracellular melanin granules were also unbound to the cell wall (Figure 5B). These extracellular melanin granules were similar to the secreted melanin granules previously reported in C. neoformans [19] and were roughly 20–40 nm in diameter (Figures 4E,F and 5B).

We found that the cells became pigmented by three hours of incubation with the melanized supernatant (Figure 6A–D). Additionally, when we added melanized supernatant from the CDC 388 strain to the non-melanizing CDC 381 strain, the CDC 381 strain accumulated pigment (Figure 6D). First, since CDC 381 cannot readily produce pigment, this experiment showed that the pigment accumulation in these add-back experiments was due to adhesion of already synthesized pigment in the supernatant rather than the production of new pigment from unreacted L-DOPA in the supernatant. Second, it indicated that the melanin-deﬁcient cells did not have a cell wall difference that made them intrinsically unable to bind extracellular melanin. These add-back experiment data, along with the secretion data of Figures 4 and 5, point to the conclusion that C. auris cell wall melanization occurs extracellularly and then sticks to the outside of the cell wall.", "J.

These extracellular melanin granules were similar to the secreted mela- nin granules previously reported in C. neoformans [19] and were roughly 20–40 nm in di- ameter (Figures 4E,F and 5B). Similarl y, samples imaged with SEM showed that melanized cells had raised structures on their surface, consistent with the structures ob- served by TEM (Figure 5C). Further, in the case of CDC 387, 388, and MMC1, the melanin granules appeared to hold the cells together in large, aggregated clumps.", "Figure 5.

We found that the cells became pig- mented by three hours of incubation with the melanized supernatant (Figure 6A–D). Ad- ditionally, when we added melanized supernatant from the CDC 388 strain to the non- melanizing CDC 381 strain, the CDC 381 strain accumulated pigment (Figure 6D). First, since CDC 381 cannot readily produce pigment, this experiment showed that the pigment accumulation in these add-back experiments was due to adhesion of already synthesized pigment in the supernatant rather than the production of new pigment from unreacted L- DOPA in the supernatant. Second, it indicated that the melanin-deficient cells did not have a cell wall difference that made them in trinsically unable to bind extracellular mela- nin. These add-back experiment data, along with the secretion data of Figures 4 and 5, point to the conclusion that C. auris cell wall melanization occurs extracellularly and then sticks to the outside of the cell wall.", "Figure 6. Extracellular melanin adheres to cell wall and is blocked following \f\u0000Glucan inhibition. (A–C) Adding non\u0000melanized cells to the melanized supernatant from its corresponding strain resulted in pigmented cells after 3 h of incubation. ( D) The melanized supernatant from the CDC 388 strain causes the non-melanizing CDC 381 strain to become pigmented. Adding the building block for chitin, N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc), to the CDC 387 ( E) and CDC 388 ( F) strains re- sulted in increased supernatant melanization, and blocking chitin synthesis with CFW resulted in less melanin in supernatant but also caused melanin \u0000coated CFW crystals on the fungal surface. Blocking \f\u0000Glucan synthesis with caspofungin resulted in increased supernatant melanization in both strains. ( G,H) Electron microscopy revealed no major differences in melanin adherence to the cell wall in either the CDC 387 ( G) and CDC 388 ( H) strains treated with GlcNAc. There were clear electron\u0000dense crystal structures on the cell walls of CFW conditions, and the caspofungin-treated conditions had little to no melanin on the cell surface.

Effects of Altering Cell Wall Structures on the Melanization of C. auris", "To determine what cell wall components were important for adherence of the melanin to the C. auris cell wall, we grew CDC 387 and CDC 388 with L-DOPA in the presence of compounds known to enhance or block the proper formation of cell-wall components [ 9,43], either through direct supplementation of these cell wall components that bind and block proper structure formation, or by inhibition of the enzyme responsible for producing that cell wall component. This strategy allowed us, in theory, to evaluate which components of the cell wall were important for extracellular melanin adherence. Culture conditions that resulted in a darker supernatant than the control condition indicated the lack of melanin adherence to the cell wall, and those with lighter supernatant indicated that the compound enhanced melanin adherence to the cell wall.", "The cell-wall polysaccharide chitin, a polymer of \f-1,4-linked N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) units, has been demonstrated to play a role in melanization in C. neoformans and C. albicans [9,44]. In these organisms, supplemental GlcNAc provided in the cell-culture me- dia was used as a substrate for chitin formation. This in turn increased the overall content of chitin in the cell wall, which in C. albicans results in increased melanin production, external- ization, and cell-wall adhesion, and in C. neoformans results in increased cell-wall melanin deposition and retention. To determine whether a similar relationship exists between chitin synthesis and melanization in C. auris , cells grown in culture medium supplemented with GlcNAc that was enriched in the NMR-active15N-isotope were examined using solid-state NMR spectroscopy (ssNMR) to determine the metabolic fate of the labeled exogenous substrate. The observation of an15N NMR signal corresponding to the amide nitrogen of chitin veriﬁed that C. auris is indeed capable of taking up exogenously provided GlcNAc and subsequently using it as a precursor for chitin synthesis (Supplementary Figure S2). In CDC 387 and CDC 388, addition of 5 mM GlcNAc did not enhance cell wall melanin adhesion and instead resulted in darker supernatant, perhaps indicating less adhesion (Figure 6E,F). In TEM micrographs, the melanin located at the cell wall exterior did not appear appreciably different for the control and the GlcNAc treated cultures (Figure 6G,H). Conversely, we added 100 \u0016M Calcoﬂuor White (CFW), a ﬂuorescent dye which forms hydrogen bonds with chitin polymers as they grow and thus disrupts proper formation of chitin microﬁbrils [ 45,46]. Adding this dye led to markedly decreased supernatant pigmentation (Figure 6E,F). Intriguingly, under microscopic analysis, the CFW appeared to precipitate and form crystals that bound the melanin. Thus, the adhesion of melanin to the CFW crystals was the likely cause of the lack of pigmented supernatant. This re- sulted in black crystals that had the ﬂuorescent properties of the CFW, along with the expected CFW-stained cell walls (Supplementary Figure S3A). The CFW crystals were also visible under electron microscopy (Figure 6H, Supplementary Figure S3B). The crys- tallization persisted despite ﬁlter sterilization. In an assay of cell-free supernatant with CFW and with/without L-DOPA, we conﬁrmed that the synthesized melanin bound to the CFW crystals and precipitated out of solution (Supplementary Figure S3C). We also noticed that the CDC 387 and CDC 388 strain supernatants without L-DOPA formed a smaller population of CFW crystals compared to the CDC 381 non-melanizing strains (Supplementary Figure S3D). This ﬁnding may indicate a correlation between the factor responsible for melanization and formation of CFW crystal fragments with a smaller size, which could indicate better solubility.", "Further, we grew the CDC 387 and CDC 388 strains in the presence of the antifungal compound caspofungin at half of the concentration reported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) [ 34] to inhibit the enzymes responsible for cell wall \f-glucan synthesis. Caspofungin treatment resulted in high levels of supernatant melanization (Figure 6E,F). Upon light microscopic and electron microscopic analysis, the treatment appeared to reduce the amount of melanin present on the cell wall, with nearly no melanin visible on the cell wall via TEM (Figure 6G,H). Additionally, for the CDC 388 strain, caspofungin treatment resulted in what appeared to be pseudohyphal growth (Supplementary Figure S3E). Although the cells were able to grow in culture with this concentration of caspofungin, in the electron micrographs, the cells appeared to have a deformed morphology, and their cytoplasmic contents looked condensed and abnormal, potentially due to antifungal stress and cell-wall defects (Figure 6G,H).", "3.8. Melanization Affects the Hydrophobicity of Some C. auris Strains", "Since melanin is a hydrophobic molecule, we investigated whether melanization had a correlation with the cell surface hydrophobicity (CSH) of the C. auris strains. With C. auris strains grown in the nutrient-rich Yeast Peptone Dextrose (YPD) media and minimal media, 7 of 12 strains had CSH that was greater than 80% (Figure 6I,J). There was no correlation between the strain hydrophobicity and its ability to melanize; the strongly melanizing strain CDC 387 and the weak/no melanizing strains CDC 381 and MMC2 all had low hydrophobicities. Conversely, the non-melanizing strain CDC 383 and melanizing strain CDC 388 had high hydrophobicity. Additionally, since hydrophobicity is known to play roles in host-pathogen interactions [ 47–49], we investigated whether melanization affected the CSH of the C. auris strains. Surprisingly, we found that in the CDC 387 strain (and to a lesser extent in the non-melanizing strain CDC 381), growth in L-DOPA for 7 days resulted in decreased CSH compared to the controls grown without L-DOPA (Figure 6K). In CDC 388 and MMC1, we did not see a change in CSH following melanization, although these strains had notably high levels of hydrophobicity at ~90%.", "3.9. Melanin Adherence Is Correlated with a Higher Cell-Wall Polysaccharide Content To further assess a potential role for the cell wall in C. auris melanization, we used 13C solid-state NMR (ssNMR) to determine whether the proportion of cell-wall polysaccha- rides in these cell samples differs between the two melanizing C. auris strains evaluated in this study, CDC 387 and CDC 388, and with respect to the non-melanizing strain CDC 381. To circumvent the need to hydrolyze and purify the cell-wall material for quantitation, we took the more direct approach of conducting direct-polarization magic-angle spinning (DPMAS) experiments on intact heat-killed C. auris cells. The experiments were carried out using parameters optimized to generate quantitatively reliable spectra, in which the inte- grated peak intensities represent the relative amounts of the different carbon types present in the various samples (Figure 7A). Thus, the relative number of polysaccharides present in each C. auris whole-cell sample could be estimated by measuring the integrated signal intensity within the spectral region where polysaccharide carbons resonate (~54–110 ppm) and comparing it to the total integrated signal intensity across the spectrum. To deter- mine whether the process of melanization elicits changes in cell-wall composition, we examined cells from the three strains, each grown in the presence and absence of L-DOPA. Since melanin pigments have been reported previously to comprise only a minor fraction (1–15.4%) of the total dry mass of melanizing fungal cells [ 50,51] and are likely to have large molar masses, the NMR signals that arise from pigment carbons make a negligible contri- bution to the overall spectral intensity. Consequently, we were able to make quantitative estimates of relative polysaccharide content regardless of whether melanin was present. Our analysis revealed that cells from the CDC 387 strain, which produce melanin that attaches robustly to the exterior cell wall, display a moderate difference in rela- tive polysaccharide content depending on whether the cells are grown with or without L-DOPA (59% vs. 67% for melanized and non-melanized cells, respectively) (Figure 7B). In contrast, the relative polysaccharide content in CDC 388, where melanin is primar- ily found in the supernatant, differed by only 2% between cells grown with or without L-DOPA (52% vs. 54%). Polysaccharide content was also constant at 52% for the non- melanizing CDC 381 strain in cultures grown with and without L-DOPA. Interestingly, the most signiﬁcant difference in relative polysaccharide content emerges if we compare the three strains rather than focusing on whether L-DOPA is present in any of their growth media. The average relative polysaccharide content of the CDC 387 cells (with and without L-DOPA) is 63%; the corresponding quantities for CDC 388 and CDC 381 cells are 53% and 52%, respectively. Taken together, our data suggest that the cells from the CDC 387 strain have an overall greater relative polysaccharide content in comparison to CDC 388 and CDC 381 cells, regardless of whether L-DOPA is present in the culture medium.

Discussion", "In this work, we have investigated the ability of C. auris to produce melanin, a mul- tifunctional pigment that is found across all biological kingdoms and contributes to the virulence of numerous pathogenic fungal species in mammals and plants. Some of the func- tions of melanin include the ability to neutralize reactive oxygen species during immune activation, inactivate antimicrobial peptides, and inactivate antifungal drugs [ 12,13,65]. Due to these immunity- and therapeutic-evasive properties, our ﬁndings that C. auris can melanize may have clinical relevance, particularly in regard to our understanding of how C. auris fungal infections are treated and considering this organism’s exceptionally high resistance to most common anti-fungal therapeutics. We evaluated whether C. auris can produce melanin, which strains produced the pigment, what substrates can be used for this melanization, where the melanin was localized, and the mechanism by which the melanin was produced.", "4.1. Characterization of Melanin Production and Localization", "We evaluated the ability of 18 C. auris strains to melanize when grown in the presence of L-DOPA, a commonly used substrate in fungal melanin research, and a common substrate for fungi that do not endogenously produce melanin. We found that most but not all of the strains melanized, which manifested by darkening of cultures, and that the ability to melanize was enhanced at higher temperatures (37\u000eC compared to 30\u000eC). We had anticipated that melanization would occur similarly in all strains, so it was surprising that only some strains had the ability to melanize. Further, based on our understanding of fungal melanization, we expected melanization to occur more at 30\u000eC rather than 37\u000eC, as it does in other fungi such as Cryptococcus neoformans [66]. This trend also has relevancy for pathogenesis in humans, as human body temperature is 37\u000eC and thus more conducive to ideal C. auris melanization conditions. Interestingly, the pattern of melanization correlated with the clade to which the strain belonged: C. auris strains from Clades I and IV , which are associated with South Asia and South America, respectively, are the melanizing strains, while the non-melanizing strains are from Clades II and III, which are typically associated with East Asia and South Africa, respectively. This demarcation could point to some lineage-speciﬁc genetic or epigenetic differences that are responsible for the melanization phenotype or are regulating the melanization process. Another aspect that differed from the pigmentation observed in other fungi was the impact of cell density on melanization byC. auris [67]. We observed that melanization in C. auris required high cell density (107cells/mL). However, at an intermediate cell density (106cells/mL) only some strains ofC. auris (CDC 382, 385, 386, and 389) were able to produce melanin, and in a delayed fashion. This observation could indicate the need of a quorum sensing molecule to trigger effective melanization in C. auris .", "Fungi have been shown to produce DHN-melanin, DOPA-melanin, and pyomelanin.", "DHN-melanin is produced from endogenous precursors formed through the polyketide synthesis pathway and not through exogenously added precursors [ 12]. Thus, we tested the production of melanin following addition of various DOPA-melanin and pyomelanin sub- strates. We found that C. auris produces melanins consistent with typical DOPA-melanins using substrates such as L-DOPA, D-DOPA, Methyl-DOPA, dopamine, epinephrine, and norepinephrine. C. auris was unable to produce melanin from L-Tyrosine, indicating there is no tyrosinase present to convert L-Tyrosine into L-DOPA and downstream melanin intermediates. Neither are there enzymes of the Tyrosine Degradation Pathway that would be needed for pyomelanin production, an observation supported by the inability to convert 4-HPP into pyomelanin pigment. The C. auris genome has hypothetical genes related to tyrosinase, as annotated by FungiDB, the online bioinformatics database for fungi, but these genes appear more related to ergosterol synthesis or magnesium/zinc ion transport. Similarly, C. auris was unable to form pyomelanin from homogentisic acid (HGA) and was unable to oxidize ABTS into its blue form. Laccases, such as those in C. neoformans , are able to produce a brown pyomelanin-like pigment from HGA and convert colorless ABTS into its blue oxidized form [ 42,68]. These results in C. auris suggest that a laccase does not exist as it does in C. neoformans, or at least none with as wide of a substrate range. Melanization in other DOPA-melanin producing fungi is often catalyzed by laccases [ 69] or multicopper ferroxidases [ 11]. Current annotation of the C. auris genome indicates there are hypothetical laccases, oxidoreductase, and ferroxidases (Ontology Groups OG6_100257 and OG6_100380); however, these appear to be related to metal ion homeostasis and part of the peroxisomal membrane. Since we do not know the function or expression pattern of these hypothetical genes, we cannot rule out that their products are capable of oxidizing catecholamines under certain conditions. However, our current body of evidence points to a non-laccase, non-tyrosinase, and general non-enzymatic mechanism as the responsible melanin-producing factor.", "We investigated the cellular localization of the melanin in three selected C. auris strains: CDC 381 which is a non-melanizing strain, CDC 387 which is a strongly melanizing strain, and CDC 388 which is a moderately melanizing strain that produces pigment primarily at37\u000eC.For some experiments, we included the MMC1 strain that, like CDC 388, is a moderately melanizing strain. Using light microscopy, we observed numerous dark ag- gregates on the outside of the melanized CDC 388, MMC1, and particularly CDC 387 cells, which tended to have a ﬂuffy appearance and appeared in between areas where cells were clumped together. In addition, the cells themselves appeared darker, and some had large intracellular melanized spots which would appear to correspond to a vacuole. Based on our evidence that melanization occurs extracellularly due to the alkalinization of the supernatant, we believe these dark spots within the vacuole are due to L-DOPA autoxi- dation within the vacuole following storage under nutrient-deprived conditions. In the CDC 381 strain, these features were minimal to non-existent. To gain further understand- ing of the melanin on an ultrastructural level, we used TEM and SEM. In essence, we found that there were electron-dense spherical structures on the surface of the melanized C. auris ,which were bound to or associated with polysaccharides in the outermost layer of the cell wall, likely \f-glucans or mannoproteins, as indicated by the lack of melanin adhesion following the inhibition of \f-glucan synthesis with caspofungin. These structures were only present in melanized cells, and they were consistent with previously reported melanin granules [ 9,19]. Interestingly, these structures were not reliably seen intracellularly, and they were signiﬁcantly smaller than the extracellular melanin structures seen during C. albicans melanization [ 9]. Using SEM, we also saw these spherical particles on the surface of the melanized C. auris strains, especially the CDC 387 strains where the surface was heavily decorated in these structures. The CDC 387 cells had a distinctive phenotype featuring many multivesicular bodies (MVBs) within the cell and merging with the plasma membrane, resulting in secretion of extracellular vesicles. Extracellular vesicles contain protein, lipid, polysaccharide, and nucleic acid cargo that could be important for extracel- lular functions; secretion could be associated with C. auris resistance to amphotericin B, adhesion to epithelial cells, and survival within macrophages [70,71].", "We noticed that the supernatants of the melanized cultures were quite dark, partic- ularly for the CDC 388 and MMC1 strains, which indicated there was secreted melanin. We also made this observation on solid agar, where all the melanizing strains had a halo of melanin around the colonies and the non-melanizing strains did not. The strongly melanizing strains CDC 385, CDC 386, CDC 387, and CDC 389 had the darkest halos of melanin surrounding the colonies. The fungal colonies themselves remained white with no change in pigmentation after 7 days of growth. The notion that the melanin is extracellular and secreted is supported by TEM and SEM results that show melanized structures on the surface of the cells. Using negative staining TEM of the isolated melanin from the supernatant, we saw melanin granules similar to those seen in TEM of whole cells, where the CDC 387 granules were the largest, followed by MMC1 and CDC 388. The CDC 381 granules were the smallest and fewest. When we added the melanized super- natant to non-melanized cells, including to CDC 381, we found that the melanin adhered to the cells and took on the appearance of a melanized cell pellet. These ﬁndings indicated that the extracellular melanin could adhere to the outside of the cell wall, suggesting a scheme whereby melanization occurred externally and aggregates of the polymer adhered to the cell wall.", "4.2. Mechanism of Melanin Production", "Although our data point to a role for the cell wall in melanin adherence, they also show that the ability of the cell wall to host adhering melanin is unrelated to melanin production itself, which appears to be an exclusively extracellular process. First, when L-DOPA was added to the cell-free supernatant of the cultures, we saw that the supernatants from CDC 388 and CDC 387 had melanizing activity whereas the supernatant from CDC 381 did not, indicating that the component responsible for melanization was extracellular. Second, melanin isolated from the culture supernatant of the melanizing CDC 388 strain can adhere to the cell wall of CDC 381 strain cells, which themselves are unable to produce melanin. Third, our ssNMR studies suggest that cell wall melanin adherence is related to the relative proportion of polysaccharides that are found in the cell wall. CDC 387 strain cells, which display robust cell-wall melanin adhesion, were found to have a greater proportion of polysaccharides in comparison to CDC 388 or 381 cells, which were determined to have a similar relative polysaccharide content and also display a similar degree of cell-wall melanin adhesion. Taken together, these ﬁndings demonstrate that melanin production and cell-wall melanin adherence are two unrelated processes and that the lack of melanization activity of the CDC 381 strain is not due to an inherent deﬁciency of the cell wall. To determine the extracellular factor responsible for melanization, we performed a series of assays on the cell-free supernatant. First, we determined that the melanization factor was stable at 100\u000eC, was resistant to proteolytic degradation by trypsin and Pro- teinase K and was smaller than 3 kDa. These observations together indicated that the melanization component was not a protein, but could potentially be a small molecule. Fur- ther, the melanizing ability of the supernatant is not enriched in the extracellular vesicles collected through ultracentrifugation, nor is it protected by EVs. We cannot exclude the possibility that EVs are used as scaffolding for the melanization, as previously found in C. neoformans [72]. However, melanization activity is not lost after treatment with methanol, urea, or SDS detergents.", "Interestingly, we found that the ability of a strain to melanize correlated directly with the pH of the supernatant within minimal media, where non-melanizing strains had a supernatant pH of ~5.75 and melanizing strains had a pH ~6.5. This strong correlation also corresponds to the steep increase in autoxidation of L-DOPA between those pH ranges. We additionally found that artiﬁcially adjusting the pH of the supernatant to pH 7 caused all of the supernatants to melanize, whereas adjusting the pH to 5.5 prevented all the supernatants from melanizing, even those from the melanizing strains. This may explain why melanization was enhanced in all supernatant conditions tested following the 6 M urea treatment, which likely neutralizes or alkalinizes the pH of the supernatant. These data suggest that the melanization trends reﬂect the ability of some strains to alter the acidity of the surrounding environment more than others. L-DOPA autoxidation is highly dependent on pH [ 17,18]. L-DOPA has an isoelectric point of pH 6.0, meaning that at pH 6 or above, the L-DOPA is more likely to have a deprotonated amine group, which results in more energetically favorable oxidation, cyclization, and dopachrome formation [ 18]. We found strong evidence that this ability to neutralize the media was due to the production of ammonia by some of the strains. Fungi including C. albicans and C. neoformans are known to produce ammonia to boost their persistence under pH stress [ 57,73,74].C. auris has been found in environmental reservoirs within marine saltwater marshes [ 2]. Microbes found in marine wetland environmental niches are faced with alkaline stress and, as a result, may be naturally more alkaliphilic [75].", "Whereas the autoxidation of catecholamines could occur in the absence of any fungus, we found that the oxidized L-DOPA from the supernatant of the C. auris strains had a different ultrastructure than the autoxidized L-DOPA from the minimal media alone at a neutral pH. This indicated that there are some properties of the supernatant that encourage the autoxidized L-DOPA to organize into speciﬁc spherical structures. Based on previous understanding of how melanin interacts with other biological molecules, we hypothesize this melanin scaffold to be polysaccharide, protein aggregates, or perhaps even lipids. The structure of the melanin polymer around this scaffolding could change its biophysical properties. This hypothesis could help to explain why there is signiﬁcantly more melanin associated with the CDC 387 strain—the strain changes the pH of the supernatant the same as the other strains, but the electron micrographs also show a large number of MVBs and organelles fusing with the plasma membrane of these cells, which would indicate a relative hypersecretion of polysaccharides, proteins, and extracellular vesicles that can subsequently serve as a scaffold for the melanization. Interestingly, the supernatant of the non-melanized CDC 387 strain has a yellow tint to it, which indicates that some molecules are being released in higher amounts compared with the CDC 381 and CDC 388 strains. This pH-based mechanism of fungal melanization differs greatly from other ways in which fungi such as C. albicans produce melanin [ 9–11]. In C. albicans, melanization is mediated by ferroxidases, a class of enzymes that is genetically similar to the melanin-producing enzyme laccase in C. neoformans. The knockout of some ferroxidase genes ( FET genes) results in a loss of melanization phenotype.", "4.3. Implications of C. auris Melanization", "We found that the C. auris strains, generally, were remarkably hydrophobic, with the cell surface hydrophobicity (CSH) of most strains in the 90–100% range. Compara- tively, the CSH of clinical isolates of C. albicans strains ranges from about 2 to 41% [ 47]. In C. albicans , CSH is reportedly associated with increased adhesion to epithelial cells, bioﬁlm formation, resistance to neutrophil-mediated killing, and increased overall virulence [48,76–78]. The current ﬁndings have implications for how C. auris interacts with hydrophobic surfaces, and how hydrophobicity may contribute to durable bioﬁlm formations within hospital environments and medical equipment. We do not ﬁnd an association between CSH and ability of the strain to melanize. Since melanin is a hydrophobic polymer, we anticipated that melanization of cultures would enhance CSH. Surprisingly, we found that growth in minimal media with L-DOPA reduced the hydrophobicity of the non-melanizing strain CDC 381 and the strong melanizing strain CDC 387, while the CSH of CDC 388 and MMC1 were virtually unchanged. We hypothesize that the hydrophobic melanin is compara- tively less hydrophobic than the hydrophobicity-mediators on the surface of the C. auris cells, so that when the melanin binds to the cell wall, it results in a relative decrease of CSH. In C. albicans , CSH is believed to be mediated by exposure of hydrophobic cell wall mannoproteins [49,79], which could correspond to areas in which melanin is deposited in C. auris [80].", "One notable observed feature of the heavily melanized C. auris CDC 387 strain is that it tended to form large aggregates of cells, which were melded together by extracellular melanin, as indicated by light and electron microscopy. This aggregation is notable, as aggregation is a known physical property in some strains of C. auris , outside of the context of melanin. The aggregate phenotype has been hypothesized to function as a way for the fungus to remain within tissues and evade immune clearance, and it may play a role in bioﬁlm formation and maintenance [ 81–83]. If melanization is inducing a sort of aggregative phenotype as our data suggest, this could have similar implications in understanding the role of C. auris melanin in pathogenesis.", "The antioxidant properties of melanin are partially responsible for its protective properties [ 84]. Melanized C. auris yeast cells were partially protected against hydrogen peroxide, and this protection was stronger in the strain where melanization is more efﬁcient (CDC 387). This observation is in accordance with the expected properties of melanin pigments [ 12,65]. However, melanin did not confer any protection to C. auris in an in vitro challenge with BMDM. The in vitro killing of C. auris by BMDM was tested at distinct times and, under the evaluated conditions, melanin played no role on protecting the fungus from the phagocytes. The previously described degree of protection from killing of pathogenic fungi conferred by melanin varies considerably (18% to >36%) [ 85], so it is possible that the pattern observed for C. auris is similar to C. albicans , for which there is no clear association between ability to produce melanin and virulence in mice [ 9]. Supporting thein vitro ﬁndings, in vivo experiments using the invertebrate G. mellonella showed that melanin produced by C. auris might not protect the fungus against innate immunity, but we cannot rule out a potential action of melanin to interfere in processes that lead to acquired immunity.", "5. Conclusions", "In summary, we found that Clade I, IV , and V strains of C. auris grown with L-DOPA and catecholamine substrates produce melanin extracellularly by alkalinizing the media with ammonia, which promotes non-enzymatic catecholamine oxidation. This extracellular melanin aggregates and binds to the outside of the C. auris cell wall (summarized in Figure 11). We did not ﬁnd evidence that the melanin formed by C. auris interferes with the effector mechanisms of innate immune cells, nor does it exhibit an active melanization process. However, our ﬁndings leave open the possibility that extracellular alkalinization could be a new mechanism by which fungi can drive the production of melanin in the environment. Not much is known about the environmental niche of C. auris; however, the ﬁrst environmental isolates have been uncovered and described in the neutral pH marine marshlands off the Andaman Islands in India, and on the surface of non-freshly picked apples in Northern India, all of which have been members of the South Asian Clade I [ 2,86]. It is possible that melanization may play a role in the environmental survival of C. auris , where the fungus is likely to encounter oxidative stressors. Ammonia is produced by other fungal species and namely in C. albicans : ammonia de-acidiﬁes the extracellular space, is produced during nutrient deprivation, and auto-induces morphologic and metabolic changes [ 57,74]. The production of ammonia and alkalinization of the extracellular milieu in C. auris might have similar roles. C. auris extracellular alkalinization might be the result of adaptations to acidic or stressful environments and aid in fungal survival uncoupled from the melanization process. With future investigations uncovering global environmental niches of C. auris from all strains, better insight can be gained into the biological signiﬁcance of our ﬁndings of clade-speciﬁc C. auris ammonia production, alkalinization, and melanization.", "J.

(C) Adding L–DOPA and CFW to non-melanized cell-free supernatant resulted in the formation of black crystals, which under the ﬂuorescent microscope have signal, indicating that the crystals are a combination of both CFW and melanin/autopolymerized L–DOPA. (D) Additionally, when CFW is added to supernatant, the crystals that form in CDC 381 strain are large and settle quickly, leaving few crystals in suspension, whereas CDC 387 and 388 form smaller crystals that do not settle rapidly and remain in the suspension. Inset is an image of the falcon tube containing the supernatant with CFW, and micrographs show a sample taken from the non-settled suspension. (E) CDC 388 cells grown in 50% MIC Caspofungin (0.5 \u0016g/mL) demonstrating pseudohyphal growth. Scale bars in A, C, D, and E represent 10 \u0016m, and scale bars in B represent 500 nm. Figure S4. Melanization activity is not associated with extracellular vesicles. Following ultracentrifugation of the C. auris –conditioned media, there is comparable melanization activity in both the supernatant and the pellet (containing extracellular vesicles) resuspended in 200\u0016L of supernatant, which represents a ~200 \u0002concentration.

The disease affects humans and animals, particularly cats, which play an im- portant role in zoonotic transmission. Feline sporotrichosis treatment options include itraconazole (ITC), potassium iodide, and amphotericin B, drugs usually associated withdeleterious adverse reactions and refractoriness in cats, especially when using ITC. Thus,affordable, nontoxic, and clinically effective anti- Sporothrix agents are needed. Recently, acylhydrazones (AH), molecules targeting vesicular transport and cell cycle progression,exhibited a potent antifungal activity against several fungal species and displayed low toxicity compared to the current drugs. In this work, the AH derivatives D13 and SB-AF- 1002 were tested against Sporothrix schenckii and Sporothrix brasiliensis .M I C so f0 . 1 2t o mg/ml were observed for both species in vitro . D13 and SB-AF-1002 showed an addi- tive effect with itraconazole. Treatment with D13 promoted yeast disruption with therelease of intracellular components, as con ﬁrmed by transmission electron microscopy of S. brasiliensis exposed to the AH derivatives. AH-treated cells displayed thickening of the cell wall, discontinuity of the cell membrane, and an intense cytoplasmic degeneration. In a murine model of sporotrichosis, treatment with AH derivatives was more ef ﬁcient than ITC, the drug of choice for sporotrichosis. Our results expand the antifungal broad-ness of AH derivatives and suggest that these drugs can be exploited to combatsporotrichosis.

Here, we studied the effects of dexamethasone and methylprednisolone on the metabolism and on the induction of virulence factors i nC. neoformans . Our results showed that both glucocorticoids increased fungal cell proliferation and surface electronegativity but reduced capsule and secreted polysa ccharide sizes, as well as capsule compaction, by decreasing the density of polysacch aride ﬁbers. We also tested whether glucocorticoids could affect the fungal vir ulence in Galleria mellonella and mice. Although the survival rate of Gallerialarvae increased, those from mice showed a tendency to decrease, with infected animals dying e arlier after glucocorticoid treatments. The pathogenesis of spread of cryptococcosis a nd the interleukin secretion pattern were also assessed for lungs and brains of infected m ice. While increases in the spread of the fungus to lungs were observed after treatme nt with glucocorticoids, a signiﬁcant difference in brain was observed only for methy lprednisolone, although a trend toward increasing was also observed for dexamethason e. Moreover, increases in both pulmonary and cerebral IL-10 production, reduction of IL-6 production but no changes in IL-4, IL-17, and INF- γwere also observed after glucocorticoid treatments.

Passive immunization targeting common fungal antigens, such as chitin and \f-glucans, are promising and would eliminate the need of species-level diagnosis, thereby expediting the therapeutic intervention. However, these polysaccharides are poorly immunogenic. To overcome this drawback, we developed the lectin-Fc(IgG) fusion proteins, Dectin1-Fc(IgG2a), Dectin1-Fc(IgG2b) and wheat germ agglutinin (WGA)-Fc(IgG2a), based on their a \u000enity to \f-1,3-glucan and chitooligomers, respectively. The WGA-Fc(IgG2a) previously demonstrated antifungal activity against Histoplasma capsulatum , Cryptococcus neoformans and Candida albicans . In the present work, we evaluated the antifungal properties of these lectin-Fc(s) against A. fumigatus . Lectin-Fc(IgG)(s) bound in a dose-dependent manner to germinating conidia and this binding increased upon conidia germination. Both lectin-Fc(IgG)(s) displayed in vitro antifungal e \u000bects, such as inhibition of conidia germination, a reduced length of germ tubes and a diminished bioﬁlm formation. Lectin-Fc(IgG)(s) also enhanced complement deposition on conidia and macrophage e \u000bector functions, such as increased phagocytosis and killing of fungi. Finally, administration of the Dectin-1-Fc(IgG2b) and WGA-Fc(IgG2a) protected mice infected with A. fumigatus , with a 20% survival and a doubled life-span of the infected mice, which was correlated to a fungal burden reduction in lungs and brains of treated animals. These results conﬁrm the potential of lectin-Fc(IgGs)(s) as a broad-spectrum antifungal therapeutic. Keywords: Fc-fusion proteins; passive immunization; Aspergillus fumigatus ; pathogenesis J.

In recent studies, our group characterized the amoeboid mannose bindingproteins (MBPs) as one of the main fungal recognition pathways. Similarly, mannose-binding lectins play a key role in activating antifungal responses by immune cells. Even inthe face of similarities, the distinct impacts and degrees of af ﬁnity of fungal recognition for mannose receptors in amoeboid and animal hosts are poorly understood. In this work, we have identi ﬁed high-af ﬁnity ligands for mannosylated fungal cell wall residues expressed on the surface of amoebas and macrophages and determined the relative importance ofthese pathways in the antifungal respon ses comparing both phagocytic models.

Silver release in suspension displayed chitosan as a potential vehicle for continuous silver discharge, with a complete release after52 days. No synergistic effects were observed in vitro when the NCs were combined with itraconazole or amphotericin B. Treatment of S. brasiliensis with NCs caused morphological deformities, cell membrane discontinuity and an intense cytoplasmicdegeneration. Remarkably, both NCs induced the growth and migration ofkeratinocytes and ﬁbroblasts when compared to control conditions. In addition, functionalization of AgNPs with chitosan signi ﬁcantly reduced its hemolytic activity, suggesting their potential use in vivo . Finally, silver nanocomposites were used as a daily topical treatment in a murine model of subcutaneous sporotrichosis, showing theability to reduce the Sporothrix infection and stimulate tissue repair.

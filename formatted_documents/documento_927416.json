The group is classified into two large clades, Chelidae and Pelomedusoides, each group having a characteristic cervical articular formula , and morphotypes occurring in both clades. However, exclusive comparative studies of the morphology and/or morphometry of the cervical vertebrae ( CVs) in this group are scarc e and comprehensive , so that focus ed on the stematic species whose neck retraction was tested. In this work, the Pleurodira neck was studied and an attempt to classify the neck types by morphotype and by clades was conducted using traditional morphometry. For this, the length of seven of the eight CVs (C2 -C8) of the neck was measured by photos in lateral view of 106 specimens of pleurod ires; their proportions were obtained; and an average for each species was calculated. Missing data, especially on extinct species, were estimated and five estimation algorithms were tested and compared. Principal Component ( PCA ) and Linear Discriminant ( LDA ) analyzes were conducted on the data in order to, respectively, verify the variation of proportions and classify the typ es of necks into five data sets, separated by clade and/or morphotype. Cluster analysis and ANOVAs on morphotypes and clades were applied to ascertain the cervical modules. PCA detected greater variations in C2 and C6 -C8, xiv in all data sets, that is, in the anterior and posterior regions. C2 is a vertebra associated with cranial and hyoid movements and muscles, therefore strongly associated with f eeding . In Chelus , this CV is even more specialized for making head alignment when capturing prey. Species in which C2 had higher proportions may have more specialized feeding habits or apparatus es. Variations in C6 -C8 may be related to the shell morphology of the species, in which species with anteriorly domed shells have higher proportions of these CVs compared to species with lower shells . Chelidae had variations mainly in C2 and C7, which structured the species with longer and shorter necks, with some overlap between the two mor photypes. Pelomedusoid es varied more in C2, C6 -C8, which structured the species by types of articulation existing in families within the clade. Variations in C3 -C5 were also observed, being notorious in Araripemys barretoi whose this neck portion is propor tionally longer and thus the species may have exhibited a mode of prey capture similar to that presented by species of the genus Hydromedusa -Chelodina ; and in Chelus , whose C5 proportion is low and possibly associated with the function of making a connecti on between two functional parts of the neck, one anterior and one posterior, that move independently, which is strictly related to the suction predation exhibited by the species. Variations in more vertebrae in Pelomedusoides than in Chelidae can be explai ned by the difference in joint formulas. The procoelous joints of Pelomedusoides are mechanically more fragile, as the rotation occurs in the convexity of the vertebra itself; this would allow for greater joint variations so that the clade was structured a ccording to the shape of these joints. On the other hand, Chelidae has a greater variety of joints along the neck, most of them being opistoc oelous , where rotation occurs in the convexity of the next vertebra, which brings greater stability to the joint an d, consequently, less restriction of joint variation. Thus, long necks are more frequent in Chelidae due to the greater stability of these joints. Discriminant analyzes indicated seven subtypes of neck in Pleurodira, three long and four short, and three in Pelomedusoides and four in Chelidae. Only one short neck subtype occurs in Chelidae, while Chelus is the only representative of a single neck type, reinforcing that the species is quite specialized. Exploratory and discriminant analyzes showed that specie s classified as long-neck ed or other clade subtypes do not necessarily show this morphotype or belong to another group, but point to convergences of some CVs that represent adaptations to similar evolutionary contexts between species. The cervical modules of Pleurodira were variable depending on clade and morphotype; only the short -neck ed morphotype showed the same modules as Pleurodira. Only one modul e was found in all datasets and is represented by C3 -C5, an xv important region for neck retraction. These res ults point to a complex evolution of the neck of this group of turtles and several specializations for different types of necks, possibly associated with feeding habits, especially in the anterior region; but that also allow the maintenance of movement in the posterior region of the neck, related to the shape of the shell , in order to allow movements for exploration of the environment and retraction of the neck, that is, protection.", "Keywords: morphometry; turtles; Chelidae; Pelomedusoides; c ervical vertebrae; missing data.", "Rio de Janeiro August /2021 xvi SUMÁRIO", "INTRODUCTION Pleurodira Cope, 1865 (i.e. the clade containing Chelus fimbriatus, Pelomedusa subrufa and Podocnemis expansa ; sensu Joyce et al., 2021) is a clade of turtles most notably recognized (and named) by horizontal neck retraction under the carapace, whereas its sister -group Cryptodira retracts the neck vertically within the shell (Williams, 1950). Each mode of retraction evolved independently in each clade (G affney et al., 1991, 2006; Werneburg et al., 2014a,b; Werneburg, 2015) so that the vertebral articulations are characteristics to allow retraction adequately (Williams, 1950; Werneburg et al., 2014a,b; Werneburg, 2015). Pleurodires are split into two linea ges that are also characterized by different cervical vertebrae articular formulae 1 (Williams, 1950; Gaffney et al., 2006). Pan-Chelidae has the formula (2(3(4(5)6)7(8), whereas in Pan -Pelomedusoides it is Pleurodire s’ species are typically identified as long - or short -necked ( e.g. Gaffney, 1977; Meylan, 1996; Shaffer et al., 1997; Georges et al., 1998; Bona & de la Fuente, 2005; Gaffney et al., 2006; de la Fuente et al., 2015 ). This neck typification was originally established based on the comparisons of the cervical with the dorsal column (Boulenger, 1888), and comprised Chelus, Hydromedusa and Chelodina as long -neckeds while other chelids (and later Pelomedusoides; Gaffney 1977) were considered short -necked. Moreover, cervical vertebrae (CV) are highly varied regarding its vertebral structures and size (e.g. Kasper, 1903; Hoffstetter & Gasc, 1969; Broin, 2007; Mariani, 2016), which are associate d with the two existing morphotypes (Pritchard, 1984). The long neck is assumed to be a derived morphotype (Gaffney, 1977; Maniel & de la Fuente, 2016) and has evolved independently several times across chelids (e.g. Shaffer et al., 1997, 2017; Georges et al., 1998; Guillon et al., 2012; Holley et al., 2020). Among Pelomedusoides (the sister -group of Chelidae), a long neck is present in the family Araripemydidae (Meylan, 1996; Gaffney et al., 2006; Sereno & ElShafie, 2013) as well as in the recent family Sa honachelyidae (Joyce et al., 2021), and as such has been considered a", "1The vertebral formula was establis hed b y Williams (1950) to represent the type of joints (concave, convex or flat; single or doubled) between each vertebra by using parenthetic symbols [= ‘)‘, ‘(’ or ‘|’, respectively]. The use of the symbol depends on the position of the joint in the vertebra. Consequently, ‘(‘ may represent either a convex articulation if anteriorly or a concave articulation if posteriorly. The same rationale applies to ‘)’. convergent evolution to chelids due to morphological similarity between them (Kischlat,", "Figure 1 – Summary of the relationship of Testudines and Pleu rodira. Topology of pleurodires illustrates the relationships of Pan -Pelomedusoides (following Joyce et al., 2021 and Ferreira et al., 2018 ) as well as the morphotypes across the clade . Morphology of articulations are shown by families or genera within the clade: triangular in Araripemydidae (dark blue), oval, larger than higher in Pelomedusidae (yellow) heterocoelic in Podocnemis and Peltocephalus (red), ‘heart -shaped’ in Erymnochelys and Turkanemys (light blue), and ova hig her than larger in Euraxemys (purple). Morphotypes of chelids are paraphyletic, meaning that they evolved independently several times. The articulation formula is given for each node. The type of neck retraction is also illustrated for both cryptodires and pleurodires: head in green, neck in red and shell in grey. Crosses indicates extinct taxa. Drawings of neck retraction based on Werneburg (2015); morphotypes silhouettes adapted from Phylopic.", "Pelomedusoides lineages show different shape of the central ar ticular surfaces, which are triangular in Araripemydidae (Meylan, 1996; Gaffney et al., 2006; Mariani, 2016); wider than high, oval -shaped in pelomedusids (Gaffney et al., 2006); heterocoelous (saddle -shaped) in the podocnemidids Podocnemis spp. and Peltoc ephalus (Williams, 1950; Gaffney et al., 2011; Mariani, 2016); and wider than high, V -shaped in Erymnochelys and the extinct Turkanemys (Wood, 2003; Gaffney et al., 2011). Therefore, the articular shape seems to be diagnostic to each lineage of Pelomedusoi des. As a result, each morphology may act directly on the way the neck moves and retracts as well as on the range of motion the species of each lineage are capable of.", "During their evolution, turtles had developed a shell that stiffened the trunk (summariz ed by Lyson & Bever, 2020), which ultimately allowed the neck to be more mobile and adapted to prey capture (Anquetin et al., 2017) and, later, to retraction under the shell for protection of the head (Williams, 1950; Werneburg et al., 2014a,b; Anquetin et al., 2017). As a result, the neck had become specialized to the life habits of turtle species (Pritchard, 1984; Anquetin et al., 2017), further acquiring cervical morphologies mechanically associated to its movements as well as a properly muscle anchorage (Shah, 1963; Hofstetter & Gasc, 1969; Gasc, 1981; Aerts et al., 2001; He rrel et al., 2008; Werneburg, 201 1).", "Living long -neckeds pleurodires are represented only by chelids (e.g. Gaffney, 1977), which are typically carnivorous species of fast, elusive preys (Ernst & Barbour, 1989; Souza, 2004; Bonin et al., 2007) and use to capture preys through a high -speed neck projection followed by engulfment of its entire body (Pritchard, 198 4; Van Damme & Aerts, 1997; Aerts et al., 2001; Lemell et al., 2002). On the other hand, short -neckeds are commonly omnivorous , with some species carnivorous (Ernst & Barbour, 1989; Bonin et al., 2007) and thus do not present the same behavior (Malvasio et al., 2003; The morphology of the cervicals has commonly been related to the neck retraction since this position demands high rotation between CVs (e.g. Williams, 1950; Werneburg et al., 2014a,b). Four functional modules have been found in th e pleurodire neck (Böhmer & Werneburg, 2017), and these differ between short - and long -necked species (Böhmer & Werneburg, 2017). However, Böhmer and Werneburg (2017) sample included only one species of each morphotype, being both chelid species (the short -necked Phrynops geoffroanus and the long -necked Hydromedusa tectifera ). Consequently, none pelomedusoid was used in the most comprehensive study on turtle neck mobility, even though this clade is rather diverse, especially considering its fossil record (G affney et al., 2006, 2011; Romano et al. 2014; Cadena, 2015; Ferreira et al., 2018; Joyce et al., 2021). Given the rich evolutionary history of Pleurodira, which comprises a variety of cervical shapes and morphologies (Pritchard, 1984; Werneburg et al., 20 14a; Mariani, 2016) the variability of adaptations on neck morphology of side -necked turtles seems to be underestimated, especially in Pelomedusoides and its extinct lineages.", "Moreover , morphological, comparative, and evolutionary studies on the cervicals within crown lineages (Cryptodira and Pleurodira) are scarce, the most extensive being on central articulations (Williams, 1950). Still, anatomical comparisons are restricted to descriptions of new fossil species, particularly for the group studied herein (e.g. de la Fuente, 2003; Bona & de la Fuente, 2005; Anquetin et al., 2017; Maniel et al., 2020). For instance, Araripemys barretoi Price, 1973, is a representant of one of the long - necked lineages of Pelomedusoides (Meylan, 1996; Gaffney et al., 2006), the family Araripemydidae. Although it is considered an example of convergent evolution of long neck with long -necked chelids (Meylan, 1996; Kischl at, 2001; Gaffney et al., 2006; Broin, 2007; Mariani, 2016), the origin of its long neck and the modular pattern between them has not been appraised earlier. This may in turn corroborate the hypothesis of convergent evolution between both lineages as well as point to the causal factors of neck elongation. Besides, the recently described Sahonachelys mailakavava points to a novel neck elongation event within Pelomedusoides, outside Araripemydidae and within crown -Pelomedusoides (Joyce et al., 2021), and adds more complexity to neck evolution within the clade. Therefore, the underlying causes that causes neck elongation and morphology may be different between these lineages, and even to chelids, which was not addressed by previous studies.", "Despite the practica lity of Boulenger’s (1888) classification in two morphotypes, it does not necessarily represent the same underlying evolutionary paths among all species of a same “group” (long or short -necked), which is evident in long -necked species (Pritchard, 1984 ). Furthermore, an adequate classification based on the study of the vertebra morphology and/or morphometr ic quantification is absent, particularly across several species/lineages of Pleurodira. To address this potential more complex evolutionary scenario, it i s necessary to understand the link between three fundamental aspects about pleurodiran neck patterns of evolution: (1) the functional modularity found by Böhmer and Werneburg (2017); (2) the distinct morphologies observed in each lineage the possibly different allometries that each CVs possess within the same neck (pers. obs.). The present study had problems with missing data, particularly in fossil specimens, which needed to be imputed by using mathematical algorithms to avoid sample reduction. Missingness is an inherent aspect for fossilized specimens, but it is not frequently preliminarily appreciated in morphometric studies using extinct species (e.g. Strauss et a l., 2003; Mariani & Romano, 2017). For a sake of adequacy of the thesis theme (i.e. turtle neck), introductory concepts and contextualization of missing data estimation and its procedures were made in the methods section.", "Furthermore, this work was tremend ously affected by the fire of the Museu Nacional, which destroyed both equipment (computers, surface scanner, cameras, and items for photograph) and material (several cervical vertebrae of both fossil and living pleurodires) as well as the workplace (i.e. the laboratory). As a consequence, the thesis’ idea has changed to adapt to a new reality; yet, recently it suffers from the pandemic’s situation and a new routine at home, which also affected the thesis progress.", "OBJECTIVES The main goal focuses on the f ollowing question: there have been evolutionary allometric diversifications of the neck of pleurodire turtles along the evolution of this clade? We aimed to address this question by studying the evolutionary allometry of the neck among the pleurodire linea ges and its relationship with its functional (ecological) aspects, such as movements and life habits. The specific objectives are (1) to qualitatively assess the types of long - and short necks and identify if they may have followed a similar pattern of all ometric evolution within Pleurodira; and (2) to describe the modules within the neck morphotypes and among different lineages.", "MATERIAL E METHODS Due to several procedures for estimation of missing data before the analyses themselves, these were separated into five steps for clarification, which are illustrated in figure 2.", "Sampling and measurements.", "Sample and measurements (step 1) Most pleurodire’s lineages were sampled, comprising 17 genera and 30 species (table 1). Five Pleurodira families were included: Chelidae (only extant species because of the scarcity of complete fossil neck materials), Araripemydidae, Euraxemydidae, Pelomedusidae and Podocnemididae. The last four families comprise Pelomedusoides lineages, with three fossil species ( Araripemys barretoi, Euraxemys essweini and Turkanemys pattersoni ) included. The sample comprises the two existing morphotypes of side -necked turtles, the long - and short -necked, as well as living species from all Gondwanan landm asses (Africa, South America, and Australasia). The long -necked species are the South American chelids Chelus fimbriatus, and Hydromedusa spp. and the Australasian Chelodina spp. as well as Araripemys barretoi , a long -necked pelomedusoid (Meylan , 1996; Gaffney et al., 2006; Sereno & ElShafie, 2013). All other species are considered short -necked (Gaffney, 1977).", "Specimens studied are housed at the Departamento de Vertebrados and the Departamento de Geologia e Paleontologia from the Museu Nacional (MN); the collection of the Serviço Geológico do Brasil (CPRM, formerly called Departamento Nacional de Produção Mineral, DNPM); the collection of Herpetology of the Museu de Zoologia da Universidade de São Paulo (MZUSP); the Zoological Collection of Amphi bians and Reptiles of the Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas Amazônicas (INPA); the Herpetology Collection of the Museu Paraense Emílio Goeldi (MPEG); the Herpetology collection of the Smithsonian Institute (United States National Museum, USNM); the Herpetolo gy collection of the American Museum of Natural History (AMNH); the Paleontology collection of the Senckenberg Museum in Frankfurt; and the collection of Paleontology of the Bayerische Staatssammlung für Paläontologie und Geologie (BSP). Due to the evoluti onary f ocus (i.e. evolutionary allometry) of this study, all specimens included in further analyses are adults in order to avoid input variance due to ontogenetic allometry ( sensu Gould, 1966). The age was determined by the size of the specimens and fusion of the vertebral elements. The skeletons were already prepared, and cervical vertebrae of all specimens were photographed in left lateral view, with identification tags and a scale/ruler at the same level of the focus to avoid distortions and measurement errors (Grillo, 2006). The atlas was removed from the analyses because it is the shortest vertebrae and accounts for a small portion of the neck length of turtles, thus not implicating in a considerable underestimation of total neck length. Furthermore, it is functionally more related to head than to neck movements (Shah, 1963; Werneburg, 2011), and is commonly missing for many fossil and extant specimens in collections.", "Figure 2 – Summary of the imputation steps and procedures herein carried out before final analyses (see text for more details).

The neck length was calculated as the sum of C 2-C8 lengths. The intervertebral dis cs in the neck vertebrae of turtles are very thin (pers. obs. from dissections of Chelonoidis carbonarius, Mesoclemmys hogei and Phyrnops geoffroanus specimens), thus they do not comprise a large intervertebral space, and consequently do not largely affect the neck length estimations for the purposes of the analyses herein performed. It is also important to notice that all fossil material do not include intervertebral discs preserved. The anatomical orientation terminology followed Smith and Dodson (2003), who suggested the terms cranial, caudal, dorsal, and ventral for four -legged animals.", "The initial sample totalized 108 specimens. However, many specimens had incomplete information on some vertebrae, sometimes with only one or two known vertebrae.

Five datasets were buil t in order to account for both morphotype and clade different iation. First, I included only the long -necked chelids into one dataset because of the clear distinctness between Chelus and other long -necked chelids (Pritchard, 1984) and separated them into three groups, each one representing its genus ( Chelus , n=8; Chelodina , n=10; and Hydromedusa , n=7). This enables to find differences between these genera other than the morphology itself, given that the genera have different habits (Pritchard & Trebbau, 1984; Souza, 2004; Bonin et al., 2007). Still, once they repre sent the same morphotype, it is n ecessary to evaluate if they follow similar allometric patterns so that they can be grouped and be compared with the short -necked species despite the clade they belong to. In other words, the analysis using this subset was carried out to check if the assumption of a single long neck morphotype is reliable.", "A second dataset was formed by classification of the morphotypes, divided into two groups, the long - (n=26) and short -necked (n=69) pleurodires. The third dataset included the Pelomedusoides species, which was classified by its clades, the families Araripemydidae (n=1), Euraxemydidae (n=1), Pelomedusidae (n=9), and Podocnemididae (n=33). In some analyses only the last two could be compared each other due to the unitary samp le for the first two families. The fourth dataset comprised the chelid species classified according to morphotypes (long -necked, n=24; short -necked, n=28), attempting to contrast with the second, full -sampled dataset. T he fifth dataset had the full s ample classified according to the two major clades studied, Chelidae (n=53) and Pelomedusoides (n=44).", "For all datasets, I have considered only the proportions of the measurements, calculated as the ratio between each CV value for a specimen and its neck length; the latter was calculated as the sum of all CV lengths (i.e. C2 -C8). These were chosen because of the normalization by their neck length, which ultimately removes aspects of size from both the animal’s neck itself and the value of the measurement. As a re sult, proportions yielded a qualitative outcome, thus allowing the evaluation of allometric patterns without the need of scaling variables. For instance, a CV with a high value of proportion might point to stronger allometry, whereas a CV with low value in dicates the opposite (“Gould - Mosimann school”; Klingenberg, 2016).", "A second aspect is that i nasmuch log values are the raw data transformed into a shorter scale, the pattern seen in both types of data is essentially the same. As a consequence, larger speci mens/species will have longer CVs and input more variance to the further analyses either in raw or log values (Mingoti, 2013). On the other hand, by using the proportions of the original variable, the data is normalized regarding the neck length of each in dividual and therefore presents clearer descriptive results about the types of necks and enable to easily identify which CV strongly contribute to total neck length. Statistical analyses Objective 1 – Classifying the types of necks The attempt of classifying the types of necks (objective 1) within pleurodires concerns to answer the following questions: Is there only one type of long neck and one type of short neck? And in which way do they differ? These questions were initial ly investigated within each dataset via ordination of the proportion data through Principal Components Analysis (PCA).", "The main goal of P CA is to reduce the dimensionality of a multivariate dataset to two or more axes, called principal components (PCs), that retain most of the variance of the data (Hammer & Harper, 2006; Manly & Alberto, 2016). These PCs are orthogonal to each other, and ordinate variables based on its variances (higher to lower variance retained) and enable a projection of the data based on a new set of variabl es (the PC scores) (Strauss et al., 2003; Hammer & Harper, 2006). Therefore, applying this technique to the dataset allows for finding structure in the data based on the variables that vary the most and theoretically have been more relevant in neck evoluti on of the sampled pleurodires. It is important to notice that each PC can be correlated to the original variables (loading values) and evaluating it permits to identify which CVs and portions of the neck retain more or less variance. Highly variable CVs in dicate less constrained evolution in a part of the neck they belong to, thus representing more plasticity. This is an initial attempt to classify the types of necks based on an exploratory projection of the individuals onto a morphospace represented by pri ncipal components. However, the analysis does not test for significant differences between the groups. PCAs were performed onto a species -only dataset (n=30) using the mean of each proportion for each species, once analyses using full dataset (n=93) yielde d similar results. By doing this, data variation and structure can be clearer understood and visually represented. The sample followed the groups’ classifications described above, and PCAs were carried out in PASTv4.03 (Hammer et al., 2001).", "A further atte mpt to classify the types of necks was carried out by applying a Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) (Hammer & Harper, 2006). Types of necks were first identified by genus or higher categories (i.e. taxonomy). Then, necks were visually classified by inspect ing the structure and the PCs (generally the PC1) of the PCAs; since the first PC retain most part of the variance, it is expected that it can be used as an initial, basic classification of necks. LDA was applied to both all the cervical proportions as wel l as the most important PCs assessed by the broken stick model, following the previously described group segregation. When only one PC was regarded as the most important, the second PC were used since LDA needs at least two variables (Hammer et al., 2006) to operate. The aim of this procedure is to compare classification based on variance of all observations to those based on the most important variance of datasets (comprised by the PCs).", "This was followed by a leave -one-out cross -validation procedure in or der to test and predict the general classification (i.e. the initial classification based on PCA inspection) of the datasets. In cross -validation procedure, sample is first divided in several subsamples (e.g. species), in which one subsample is used as tes t (or validation) while the remaining subsamples are used as the training data of the model (Browne, 2000; Hastie et al., 2008); then the error model is calculated and model performance can be assessed. In leave -one-out cross -validation, this step is perfo rmed by testing all possible ways to divide data (every species in the present work; Kohavi, 1995). As a result, initial classifications are put to prove through as statistical procedure and testing.", "Objective 2 – Assessing the functional modules within t he neck The assessment of modules within the neck was attempted via cluster analysis and PCoA in PAST v.4.03 (Hammer et al., 2001) onto Euclidian distances of cervicals; however, due to the high number of comparisons it would take, only morphotypes and higher groups (Chelidae and Pelomedusoides) were analyzed. Clusters were analyzed through the Ward’s method algorithm onto Euclidian distances between the mean proportion values of each cervical for individual species in PAST v4.03 (Hammer et al., 2001); a si milar approach was applied by Böhmer and Werneburg (2017) onto CVs landmarks’ coordinates of fossil turtles, by differing on the usage of single -linkage method. Euclidian distance is inherent for this algorithm as it works to increase within - group variance as little as possible (Hammer et al., 2006). Here, observations are CVs and variables are the species.", "Clusters were carried out globally as a broader comparison but also in groups individually in order to account for the within variance/correlation only and compare the similarity patterns between long - and short -necked groups as well as higher clades (Chelidae vs. Pelomedusoides).

On the other hand, the other four methods had higher distances (figure 4) as well as only one (NLPCA, BPCA, BLR) or none (PMM) estimated variables were correlated to the originals.

Missingness of A. barretoi was estimated in one run and had estimations rather close to the observed valu es in cervicals with only one observation (C2-C4 and C6); while estimations in C5 and C8, with two observations, had different estimations from the observed values (C7 was the only cervical with information in the three specimens). Bauruemys elegans sample needed to be split into two subsamples because of the different missingness distribution of the variables, i.e. the anteriormost part of the neck (C2 -C4) have more missing information (MD=72.22%) than the medioposterior (C5 -C8; MD=55.55%). As such, a firs t round of estimation was run with C5-C8 of the six specimens. It was followed by another round with C2 -C4 of only two specimens (MN7017 -V and MZSP -PV138) because they are the specimens with observed values in the anteriormost portion of the neck (another specimen, MZSP -PV136 have only the C2 of this part of the neck), but also have observed values for the C4 thus allowing a variable as a basis for comparison for the estimations. Then, both subsamples were united into the full sample with missing data in th e C2 -C4 of only four specimens, which was estimated using both algorithms (NLPCA and BPCA).

PCA structure and vertebral variation on Pelomedusoides Most part of the variation (92.93%) was accounted by the three first PCs, all considered relevant by the broken stick model (table 11). The variance summarized by the first component was mostly related to C2, C5 and C8 (C2>C8>C5). Despite the lower eigenvalue of C5 in PC1 compared to C2 and C8 (table 11), it had the highest correlation with this component (corr. C2 = 0.844; corr. C5 = -0.869; corr. C8 = 0.744), and therefore was considered as a relevant variable. Thus, the PC1 comprised the variance in the three main points of articulation along the neck, as observed by Williams (1950). The PC2, in turn, accounted for variance in C6 and C7 (C7> C6). Finally, the PC3 comprised the variance in C2 and C8 (C2>C8), thus another aspect of the anterior - and posteriormost regions of the neck. The PC3 also showed a modular correlation of the neck, in which C2 -C4 had positive correlations (and values) wher eas C5 -C8 had negative correlations (and values).", "Table 10 – Accuracy of LDAs onto Chelidae sample separated by morphotype and by PC1 scores (see text for number classifications) using cervical dataset and PC scores of the species.

(1) The anteriormost represented by C2, (2) a midanterior part with C3 -C5, (3) a midposterior module with C6 -C7, (4) and the posteriormost represented by C8. The midposterior modu le (C6 -C7) is clearly the most distinct module (Fig12A, B). The posteriormost module (C8) is more similar to the midanterior part (C3 - C5) considering results found herein including all pleurodires analyzed but is nested with the anteriormost module (C2) co nsidering the cluster including only Pelomedusoides species (figure 12B). The neck of Pelomedusoides ( figure 12B ) differs from the pleurodirans only in having C2 and C8 more similar.", "The results achieved considering only Chelidae species are poorly supported (figure 12C) and found different phenetic modules. Only C3 -C4 cluster was found in common, differing greatly to the results found to Pleurodira (figure 12A) and Pelomedusoides (fig ure 12B). The clade showed five potential modules: C2, C3 -C4, C5 - C6, C7 and C8 (figure 12B).", "The structured phenetic modularity found for short -necked turtles ( figure 13B) is identical to that found to all Pleurodire turtles (figure 12A). It is likely to b e due to the fact that most side -necked turtles are short -necked species. Furthermore, it is similar to the modularity of Pelomedusoides (figure 12B), except that the C2 and C8 are not as similar as in Pelomedusoides.", "Modules of long -neckeds ( figure 13A ), on the other hand, were different, with contrasting results if compared to clusters found analyzing other subsets of species. It shows more similarities with cluster analysis considering Chelidae species alone, possibly because almost all long -necked turtl es belong to this family ( Araripemys being the single exception). In cluster analysis of long -necked (figure 13A) and Chelidae (figure 12C) three similar modules were found: C3+C4, C5+C6, and C7. Interestingly, the most cranial (C2) and caudal (C8) vertebr ae were clustered in phenogram analyzing long -necked species (figure 13A) and Pelomedusoides species (figure 12B). The clearest result is identifying C3+C4 as a functional module since it was found in all analyses. The conflicting results suggests that sho rt- and long -necked turtles might have different functional modules in the neck.", "Figure 12 – Cluster analyses of cervicals of Pleurodira (A), Pelomedusoides (B), and Chelidae (C).

The effect of missingness have been assessed and discussed for phylogenetic reconstructions (e.g. Norell & Wheeler, 2003; Wiens, 2003; Wiens & Morrill, 2011; Sansom, 2015; Guillerme & Cooper, 2016), morphometric studies (Strauss et al., 2003; Strauss & Atanassov, 2006; Couette & White, 2010; Neubauer et al., 2012; Mariani & Romano, 2017), and to inspect the impact of estimation in molecular clocks (Wiens & Morrill, 2011; Zheng & Wiens, 2015).", "Most of these works explored the missingness in a broad phylogeny or multivariate statistical analyses. In phy logenetic studies, simulations and real datasets are used to assess the effect of missingness on tree reconstruction and support indexes (e.g. Wiens & Morrill, 2011; Guillerme & Cooper, 2016), but no estimation of characters states is performed. In morphom etric studies, on the other hand, filling missing data can be achieved by statistical procedures.", "A common procedure is replacing MDs by a univariate central tendency value (e.g., mean value; Wilks, 1932; Strauss et al., 2003). In paleontology studies, in which species are commonly represented by a single incomplete or few fragmentary specimens, one could replace a missing value by a value known for higher taxonomic level (genus or family) or by the mean value of two sister -species. All these procedures are inadvisable because they highly likely lead to misleading results. Mariani & Romano (2017) have addressed this problem studying the morphometry of B. elegans skulls of different sizes and concluded that replacing missing values on an ordination plot (PCA) via iterative imputation leads to more reliable (and conservative) results. However, it is important to be cautious on how statistical software (e.g., PAST) handle missing entries by checking whether mean value imputation is the default configuration. It is possible that many authors ignore the problem of this procedure and bias their results. By inputting a central tendency value (such as the mean value) to a variable, it is expected that the variance be reduced (Little, 1998) in a way directly dependent on the amount of missing data for this variable. Thus, in an ordination analysis like PCA, it is expected that original variables with more missing data become less correlated (smaller eigenvalues) to principal components of variation , although it was not tested . Therefore, improvements on missing data estimation are imperative to achieve reliable results based on exploratory analyses of multidimensional data containing some missing data.", "In addition, if estimations are performed onto a multi -species sample (e.g. Strauss et al., 2003 with Pterodactylus spp.; Strauss & Atanassov, 2006 with Canis spp. and Cottus spp.; Couette & White, 2010 with the genera Hapelemur and Eulemur ), it is important to be cautious of the effect of phylogeny in e stimations. Estimations of close - related species seem to be fair and not reducing accuracy and reliability (Strauss et al., 2003). However, in datasets with different phylogenetic groups, estimations might be preferably done by splitting the sample into su bsamples, using same genus or species whenever possible.", "This issue was somehow addressed herein. Dubious estimations were found when estimating the extant Pelomedusidae specimens. Four specimens comprising three species were excluded due to biased estimat ion. We speculate there are two sources of noise that reduce estimation accuracy and precision: (1) the use of different species and genera in estimations, with different sizes (Loveridge, 1941; Broadley, 1981) and allometric evolution, thus not free of ph ylogenetic uncertainty (although this effect was not tested); and (2) due to the low sample, particularly for Pelomedusa subrufa (n=4) but for Pelomedusidae (n=9) as well, which hampers parameters and thus values estimations (Strauss et al., 2003; Neubauer et al., 2012; Buuren, 2018). Obviously, ontogenetic variation should also be considered and removed whenever possible; but this was not the case of Pelomedusidae once all specimens were adults. However, sampling specimens from the same age and group do no t remove phylogenetic allometric differences between different species.", "Problems with low samples are also commonly found in paleontology. In cases in which there is only one specimen or body part (some species are recognized by more than one specimen with different preserved body parts) of the extinct species, however, relatively fair results can be achieved by using a multi -species sample. This was exemplified by Euraxemys essweini . This species had only one missing vertebra in the single specimen (C2 is partially preserved; pers. obs.) and estimation was executed using all pelomedusoids. The species is a short -necked (Gaffney et al., 1991; pers. obs.) and possibly has different allometries in comparison to other species, especially to the long - necked Arar ipemydidae Araripemys barretoi , but I did not consider the estimation tremendously biased once the amount of missing data was too low. Moreover, even though A. barretoi is a long -necked (Meylan, 1996; Kischlat, 2001; Gaffney et al., 2006) it was represented by only one specimen, and therefore had little impact on estimations. Other aspect considering the confidence of missing data estimation is that one cannot only account for the percentage of missing data in the fossil specimen, but for the distribution of missingness across the matrix (Strauss et al., 2003; Strauss & Atanassov, 2006; Brown et al., 2012; Neubauer et al., 2012). Even when there are several specimens of a given species, it does not guarantee accurate and precise estimations. Proced ures in fossil species herein evaluated ( A. barretoi and B. elegans ) demonstrated that a balanced missing data distribution along the neck is rather important. In vertebrae with one or two observations, as can be exemplified by A. barretoi (table B), estim ations for missing variables were either close or between the observed value(s) for each variable, even when a higher number of specimens (n=6) were used for estimations. Therefore, even when half of the cervical vertebra entries be almost filled with obse rved values, if the other half does not have a fair number of observed values, the estimations proved to be severely (negatively) influenced for these variables, regardless sample size.", "2) Specializations and types of neck within Pleurodira The two major t ypes of necks of pleurodires, namely short - and long -necked, have been suggested by Boulenger (1888) based on the neck being shorter or longer than the dorsal vertebral column, respectively. This distinction was identified for Chelidae only, differing the long-necked species of the genera Chelus, Hydromedusa and Chelodina from all other chelid species. Such general identification of neck types was subsequently used by Gaffney (1977) for classification of chelids and later the vertebral morphologies were use d as characters in phylogenetic studies (e.g. Bona & de la Fuente, 2005; de la Fuente et al., 2017; Maniel et al., 2018; Oriozabala et al., 2019; Maniel et al., 2020). The monophyly of long -neckeds has been recovered in unconstrained phylogenetic analyses based solely on morphological characters (Gaffney, 1977; Bona & de la Fuente, 2005; Maniel et al., 2018, fig. 11A; Oriozabala et al., 2019; Maniel et al., 2020), meaning that the type of neck elongation is an informative feature. On the other hand, phyloge netic analyses based on molecular data only or “global” analysis including both morphological and molecular characters, sometimes consisting of constrained molecular topologies (molecular: e.g. Seddon et al., 1997; Georges et al., 1998; Guillon et al., 201 2; “global”: e.g. Cadena, 2015; Maniel et al., 2018, fig. 11B; Holley et al., 2020), found two ”biogeographic clades”, South American and Australasian, indicating a convergence of morph ologies related to neck elongation. Such convergence includes Chelus and Hydromedusa in South America and Chelodina in Australia , a relationship that has been already argued by Pritchard (1984).", "Although these genera do have longer CVs, they do not present the same type of neck as previously noticed by Pritchard (198 4; more details below), who argued the elongation varies greatly throughout the neck between the three genera: Chelodina , Chelus and Hydromedusa . Furthermore, the results found for short -neckeds cervical lengths showed a notable variation within this gener al morphotype (figure 10), and even yielded a phylogenetic structure within Pelomedusoides (figure 8). Therefore, Boulenger’s (1888) classification of long - and short -necked is a generalization of a much more complex variation of neck length, even when con sidering Chelidae alone (figure 7). 2.1) Types of neck in long -necked chelids The results found on the ordination analyses of long -necked chelids (Figure 6) allow us to hypothesize that exists at least two types of long -necked chelids: Chelus and Hydromed usa-Chelodina . This was corroborated by the LDA analysis onto PC scores (table H), which found three types of neck. Although Chelus was classified together with H. tectifera , it notably has different proportions in respect to the latter species. The neck of Chelus is the most strikingly different neck, so that it was found in a separate part of the morphospace represented by most relevant component (= PC1). This neck is characterized by higher proportions in the anterior part of the neck (C2 -C4) and, in general, shorter cervicals in the midposterior portion of the neck (C5 -C8; figure 14). Pritchard (1984) described and correlated the neck morphology of long -necked chelids (figure 15A, B) to the specialized feeding behavior for fast, elusive preys, being fishes, insect larvae or tadpoles (Fachín -Teran et al., 1995; Souza, 2004; Kenneth et al., 2009). He proposed that Chelus feeds by trawling or netting, with lateral swiping of the neck. Lemell et al. (2002) described the steps this species takes to p erform prey capture, highlighting the position of the neck (figure 15C) in which its anteriormost part (C1 -C2) is entirely aligned with the head while the next part (C3 -C4) works as a “bridge” between the first CVs and the biconvex C5. This conformation en ables the reinforcement of the head and the anterior part of the neck for the thrust upon the prey. The rather different proportions of Chelus , especially the longest C2 ( table 16) is consistent with this specialized type of feeding. The shortest C5, in tu rn, works separating two systems, one anterior and other posterior, that can move independently from one another because of the biconvex articulation of this cervical (Williams, 1950). Therefore, despite the LDA classification, the neck of Chelus might be considered differently from H. tectifera because of its different proportions (figure 14) and morphology, which seems to be related to a different, specialized behavior for prey capture.", "Figure 14 - Descriptive plots of cervical proportion of long -necked Chelidae. A. Boxplots. B. Line graphs. Chelus shows the longest C2 with decreasingly proportion from C3 to C5, contrary to other long -neckeds, thus showing the most elongated anterior part of the neck. Hydromedusa and Chelodina show similar patterns of pr oportions, but Chelodina spp. usually have longer C7 and H. tectifera shows more uniform cervical proportions. Almost all species show a much shorter C8 compared to its anterior vertebra. Colors by genus: blue – Chelodina ; yellow – Chelus ; red – Hydromedus a.", "The other type of neck described by Pritchard (1984) includes Hydromedusa and Chelodina, which possess the spear -feeding or harpooning behavior, with forward strike and straight alignment of C1 -C4 (figure 15A). The neck of these species is consistent with the hypothesis of a second type of long neck, different from the Chelus -type described above. However, Pritchard’s classification appeared to be simple, regarding only cervicals’ morphologies. Analyses onto the proportions (figure 6 and table 8) pointed to three subclassifications within this type of neck: (1) H. tectifera , (2) H. maximilliani , C. expansa, C. longicollis, C. parkeri, C. novaeguineae, and C. canni , and (3) C. pritchardi . The plots (figure 14) aid in visualizing the differences and similarities. Hydromedusa tectifera (subtype 1) shows a relatively uniform vertebral proportion. Th e subtype 2 may differ anteriorly, either having uniform proportions in the anterior (C2 -C4, H. maximilliani ) or midanterior (C2 -C5, C. parkeri ; C2-C5, C. expansa ) neck, or shorter C2 in comparison to the midanterior neck (C3 -C5, C. longicollis, C. novaegu ineae, C. canni ) with an increasing in C6; but all species within this subtype shows a high increasing in C7 proportion (not as high in H. maximilliani ) followed by a tremendous decreasing of C8 proportion. The last subtype ( C. pritchardi ) is notable in having a progressive increasing in cervical proportion from C2 to C5, then a shorter C6, followed by a high increasing in C7 and decreasing in C8.", "The spear -feeding technique (Pritchard, 1984) of these species has already been described (Van Da mme & Aerts, 1997; Aerts et al., 2001). It consists of the protrusion of head and neck depends on the alignment of the anterior portion of the neck before harpooning and mouth opening, which ultimately causes the displacement of water and further forwards movement of head and neck towards the prey (Van Damme & Aerts, 1997; Aerts et al., 2001). In contrast to Chelus, the species with this behavior are characterized by shorter anterior neck (C2 -C4) and longer C5 and C7. The longer C5 and C7 in these species ( figure 14; table 16) would stabilize the mid - and posterior neck, respectively, when moving onto the C6. Such configuration would provide an efficient frontwards thrust while both parts rotate towards alignment (i.e. to the same direction) during strike. T herefore, both CVs play a different role from Chelus . Table 16 – Ratio of most important CVs for each PC in long -necked Chelidae sample. Superscripted numbers indicate de type of neck found in LDA analysis onto PC1 scores.

On the other hand, C5 and C7 work differently from one another as rotation points in the midposterior part of the neck (figure 15C), but do not lead to independent movements of these parts of the neck, which act in conjunction for an entire neck protrusion. In other words, alignment and striking in Chelus occur over C5 articulation, whereas in Hydromedusa -Chelodina the whole neck is extended when feeding.", "Figure 15 – Types of neck in long -necked Chelidae described by Pritchard (1984).

Hydromedusa spp. are clearly distinguished by longer C2 and shorter C7 in H. tectifera (table 16). These differences could be a result of the larger size of H. tectifera (Bonin et al., 2007) which leads to more musculature mass associate d with feeding (i.e. muscles of both jaw and hyoid bones) and neck retraction in the anteriormost part of the neck (Shah, 1963; Pritchard, 1984; Herrel et al., 2008; Werneburg, 2011), as well as neck movements in the posteriormost part of the neck (Shah, 1963; Pritchard, 1984; Herrel et al., 2008).", "The variation between Chelodina species is larger than in Hydromedusa , probably because Chelodina is a more specious genus (figure 6; TTWG, 2017). Such variation was notable in both PCs ( figure 6), as these species have more variation in C2 and C5, particularly in C. canni and C. pritchardi (table 16). This variation may be related to each phylogenetic group (i.e., C. longico llis group and C. expansa group; e.g. Georges et al., 2002; McCord & Thomson, 2002). This was clearer for the C. longicollis group, in which the four sampled species ( C. longicollis, C. canni, C. pritchardi and C. novaeguineae ) were more variable in PC plo ts (figure 6), whereas C. expansa and C. parkeri were similar in PC1 but slightly different in PC2.", "The variation may also relate to the distribution of each group across Australia and New Guinea (Georges & Thomson, 2010; TTWG, 2017), so that every species within both groups live in different river basins (Georges et al., 2002; McCord & Thomson, 2002). U nmack (2001) proposed Australian biogeographical regions based on fish biota, and distribution of Australian Chelodina species seems to follow these regions (Georges et al., 2002); this may hold true for New Guinean species as well, since there is little taxonomic overlapping between long -neckeds in the island (Georges et al., 2002). Therefore, variation between Chelodina spp. might relate to different biogeographical areas which ultimately show its own climatic particularities that may have influenced evolution and morphology of the turtle species herein considered.", "Interestingly, C. expansa and C. longicollis had similar plots (figure 6) and occupy the same riverine systems (Georges & Thomson, 2002; Kenneth et al., 2009) and biogeographical region (Unmack, 2001), which may indicate a convergence related to similar habitat. This seems to be corroborated by the observations that C. longicollis often occupy water bodies alone (Chessman, 1988; Kenneth et al., 2009), despite living in sympatry with C. expansa .", "2.2) Types of neck in Chelidae The structure of chelids generally opposed long - and short -necked species in PC1, with a partial overlapping between both morphospaces (figure 7). The structure of long - neckeds was the same as in the previous analyses. Since variation accounted by PCs using this sample is essentially the same as in long -neckeds, this is not a surprising result. The morphospace of long -neckeds, however, has been widened towards negative PC1 (the direction of most short -neckeds) by C. canni . The species is represented by one small specimen (a larger specimen is housed at the collection of MZUSP but was not possible to be assessed herein), which, though not a juvenile, could has been influenced the long - necked morphospace. The analysis removing t his species yielded the same result though. The scatter of short -neckeds (figure 7), in turn, also demonstrated variation in C2 and C7, as in long -neckeds, but had a larger variation in C8 that was not seen in long - necked (figure 6); so that such variation was comprised by PC2 in chelid sample (figure 7, table I). Descriptive graphics of the proportions (figure 16) demonstrate these variations. Therefore, the two morphotypes within Chelidae generally vary in the same vertebrae (C2 and C7), but variation is specific in C5 (figures 6, 14 and 16) for long - neckeds and in C8 for short -neckeds (figures 7 and 16).", "Variation in C2 proportions in long -neckeds chelids was already discussed and could be related to specific habits for prey capture (e.g. Pritchard, 1984; Lemell et al., 2002). In short -neckeds, in turn, the high variation in C2 is possibly related to a more diverse feeding habits, since species typically considered within this morphotype are more omnivorous and herbivorous (Georges, 1982; Ernst & Barbour, 1989; Spencer et Variation in C7 is relatively similar in both morphotypes, but that in C8 is much larger in short -neckeds (figure 16). Wise and Stayton (2017) showed the shell of long - neckeds is generally flatter than short -neckeds. Furthermore, they showed the shell of Australasian short -neckeds ( Elseya, Emydura ) is anteriorly domed in contrast to South American. These shel l differences between may be related to posteriormost cervicals lengths: in anteriorly domed -shelled species, both C7 and C8 would be longer in order to allow adequate neck extension beyond carapace margin. Conversely, anteriorly flatter shells would not n eed a longer C8 but a longer C7 is necessary once this vertebra marks the carapace anteriormost limits (Williams, 1950), thus an important point for neck vertical movements since it is more mobile than C8 (Werneburg et al., 2014b).", "Figure 16 – Descriptiv e plots of cervical proportion of Chelidae by morphotypes. A. Boxplots. B. Line graphs. Variation was high in C2 and C7 in both morphotypes but was particular higher in C8 of short -neckeds (gold). Short -neckeds showed more variation in almost all cervicals compared to long -neckeds (blue), except C5 and C2 and C7, which were lower in C5 and somehow similar in C2 and C7. Open circles represent outliers in box-plots.", "Acanthochelys pallidipectoris was demonstrated to be a notorious species among short -neckeds because it owns the third highest C2 proportion (figure 16), and for that reason had scores of PC1 similar to long -neckeds (figure 7) and was classified as the same neck type as H. tectifera and Chelus (table J). The anteriorly longer neck can be an adapta tion to eat fast prey such as aquatic insects and fishes (Vinke et al., 2011), although neither the feeding behavior has been described for the species nor more detailed information on the eaten insects were given by the authors. However, as Ac. spixii feed mostly on odonatans nymphs (Brasil et al., 2011), Ac. pallidipectoris may presumably feed more on these items as well, especially because these insects prefer lentic than lotic environments (Pimenta & Pelli, 2019), which is the case of Ac. pallidipectori s preferred habitat (Vinke et al., 2011). Therefore, anterior elongation in the species would be a convergence with long -neckeds based on similar feeding.", "On the other hand, Ac. pallidipectoris differs in the posteriormost cervicals, namely C7 and C8 (figu re 7 and 16), having the highest C7/C8 ratio (i.e., longer C7 than C8; table 17). In fact, all South American (SA) short -necked chelids had high C7/C8 ratios (not as high in Rhinemys, but still higher than ither short -neckeds), so that they were structured close in PC2 (figure 7). South American species have similar shell shape, not being as anteriorly domed as the Australasian species (Wise & Stayton, 2017), which is possibly associated to the vertebral proportions as previously discussed. The PC2 may have structured SA short -necked chelids phylogenetically, with the species Acanthochelys spp., M. hogei and P. geoffroanus closer to one another, whereas Rhinemys was plotted closer to Australian species (figure 7). The three former species have been found as more closely related, whereas Rhinemys belongs to a sister lineage (Guillon et al., 2012; Holley et al. 2020; but not in Pereira et al., 2017). In addition, t he similar ratio between M. hogei and P. geoffroanus is concordant with the relatedness of the first species to the genus Phrynops , found in the abovementioned phylogenetic studies, but differences in C2 seems to show M. hogei as a different species. Wheth er it belongs to a different genus (e.g. Ranacephala , McCord et al., 2001) depends on increasing the sample to more Phrynops specimens by also including other species of the genus. Moreover, the similarities in C7/C8 ratio between Acanthochelys, M. hogei and P. geoffroanus may be due similar shell shapes (Wise & Stayton, 2017), though these cervicals may be a source of phylogenetically informative characters that ultimately aid in taxonomy.", "Table 17 – Ratio of most important CVs for each PC in Chelidae s ample.

Mesoclemmys hogei specimens have relatively taller skulls than P. geoffroanus (skull height/skull length: M. hogei = 0.34428; P. geoffroanus = 0.27595), which could be related to frugivory (i.e. Ficus fruits) described for the species (Drummond et al., 2010) and more muscle mass associated to head moving (e.g. m. collosquamosus, m.", "atlantoepistropheo -occipitis principa lis, m. collooccipitis , Werneburg, 2011). Furthermore, Benevenuto (2017) found shape differences between specimens of M. hogei and P. geoffroanus related to feeding osteological skull parts (e.g. triturating surfaces, trochlear system), which may indicate that differences between the two species may be due to feeding habits. Still, bigger P. geoffroanus have a flattened and slightly curved anteriormost part of the skull, in the region of frontals and prefrontals (N. Benevenuto, comm. pers.). This type of mo rphology is observed to the extreme in Chelus skull (Pritchard & Trebbau, 1984; Lemell et al., 2002, 2010). This points to a longer neck in P. geoffroanus possibly associated to faster preys such as fishes and odonatan larvae (Dias & Souza, 2005), in which an anteriormost short skull owns less water dragging and more success in prey capture (Lemell et al., 2002).", "Despite the scatter of SA short -necked chelids, the C7/C8 ratio (= PC2) demonstrate a variation that structures AUS and SA short -neckeds (figure 7 ). Consequently, the evolution of these CVs may have followed the continental split of South America and Australia and evolution of each clade separately (Seddon et al., 1997; Georges et al. 1998; Guillon et al., 2012; Maniel et al., 2018, constrained anal ysis). Nevertheless, variation in Australian SNs was also observed and notably regarding Em. krefftii and others Emydura spp. in the sample (figure 7). Emydura krefftii has long been considered a subspecies of the Emydura macquarii complex (e.g. Fritz & Havas, 2007; Georges & Thomson, 2010; Todd et al., 2014; TTWG, 2017), although it has already been considered a separate species (Goode, 1967; Ernst & Barbour, 1989). The species presented the lowest C2/C7 ratio but the highest C7/C8 ratio among the genus (table 17). Despite that, the distribution of Em. krefftii is separated by the others by the Great Dividing Range in Northeastern Australia, formed during the Cenozoic (Todd et al., 2014). It is possible this morphological difference between Em. krefftii and Em. macquarii indicates a possible unobserved species -level distinction due to biogeographical isolation in the complex. Further, other -body parts osteological comparisons should be carried out in order to investigate if both species are distinct, once distinction of subspecies of Em. macquarii complex is based on external morphology (e.g. Georges & Thomson, 2010).", "Four types of necks were recognized in LDA analyses (table 10); only one is exclusively represented by typical long -neckeds (type 3, with C. expansa, C. longicollis, C. parkeri and H. maximilliani ; Boulenger, 1888; Gaffney, 1977). All other types had a mixture of both morphotypes. These results point to convergence events related to neck elongation among chelid species, which are possibly related to environmental pressures such as feeding habits (e.g. Pritchard, 1984; Maniel et al., 2018 for long -neckeds). Nonetheless, such similarities occur differently so that each species owns singular proportions combinations. Thus, it is diffi cult to find a clear -cut classification of a short and a long neck based onto proportions only. Neck elongation is more studied in long - neckeds chelids, focused on its origin (e.g. Gaffney 1977; Georges et al., 1998; Bona & de la Fuente, 2005; Guillon et a l., 2012; Maniel et al., 2018); however there seems to be a large variation in short -neckeds that has not been deeply studied so far and that points to a rather complex neck evolution within chelids.", "2.3) Types of neck in Pelomedusoides 2.3.1) The cervica l articular shape of Pelomedusoides Published studies regarding pelomedusoids’ neck are not as common as chelids’ and rely mostly on comparisons between Araripemys barretoi and other pleurodires (Kischlat & Campos, 1990; Meylan, 1996; Kischlat, 2001; Seren o & ElShafie 2013) or have been addressed in a more general context (Broin et al., 2007). The thorough comparative anatomy of Gaffney et al. (2006, 2011) aimed particularly the skull and shell morphology, though few comments on cervicals were made. Perhaps the most important and broader work so far is Williams (1950) who described and compared the articulation patterns on turtles as whole. The recent studies on turtle neck did not include a representative sample of pelomedusoids (e.g. Werneburg et al., 2014a,b; Werneburg, 2015). Consequently, the lack of a large -scale comparative anatomy on pelomedusoid neck hampers a broader understanding on the relationship between neck length and morphology, although such comparative study is ongoing.", "All pel omedusoids have the same pattern of cervical articulation (biconvex C2, procoelous C3 -C8; Williams, 1950; Gaffney et al., 2006, Joyce, 2007), but lineages show different shapes of vertebral articulation (Gaffney et al., 2006, 2011). Araripemys has triangul ar-shaped articular surfaces (Meylan, 1996; Gaffney et al., 2006; probably also found in Taquetochelys tenerensis , Sereno & ElShafie, 2013, fig. 14.18); Pelomedusidae has wider than high articular surfaces (Gaffney et al., 2006); within Podocnemididae, Podocnemis spp. and Peltocephalus show higher than wide, saddle -shaped joints (Gaffney et al., 2006), while Erymnochelys -Turkanemys own wider than high, heart - shaped articulations (Gaffney et al., 2011). Euraxemys , in turn, shows articulations higher than wid e (pers. obs.). Therefore, even though the formula is the same among all pelomedusoids, the shape of the articulations presents great variation. Interestingly, such diversification was rather relevant in structuring the species and lineages of Pelomedusoid es, i.e. species with the same type of articulation shape were plotted close one another (figure 8), even though three types of necks were recognized (table 12). Such structure becomes even clearer if the genus Pelusios is consider alone (i.e. all species of the genus are put together; figure 17), and the variation across the species are summarized for the genus. This result highlights that Gaffney’s et al. (2011) discernment onto the cervicals of Erymnochelys -Turkanemys is correct and should be used as a p hylogenetic informative character. However, it is not possible to address the origin of each type of articulation within the phylogeny of Podocnemididae, as important stem species (e.g. Bauruemys elegans 2, Lapparentemys villavilensis ) have not been analyz ed herein and are rather relevant in reconstructing the evolutionary aspects of the centra of CVs (Mariani, 2015). The causes that shaped the central articulation surfaces are unclear, but some aspects can be brought up here.", "Figure 17 – Scatterplot of PCA of the species mean dataset of Pelomedusoides clades with all Pelusios together (green circle) .

The structure regarding articular shape and family is clearer, especially in A, except for Euraxemys (purple rectangle) which was inside the podocnemidid morphospace (red). Symbols by species as in figure 8.", "2 Bauruemys elegans was initially included in the sample but were removed from final analyses due to dubious estimations, thus precluding any discussion on cervical evolution. 2.3.2) Neck morphology and elongation in trian gular -shaped Araripemys barretoi The triangular -shaped articulation of A. barretoi allows movements in basically three directions (O. Grillo, pers. comm.; figure 18); however, the horizontally oriented postzygapophyses (Meylan, 1996) limit vertical and favor lateral movements (e.g. Taylor & Wedel, 2013). Vertical movements of head and neck would thus be allowed by small vertical and slightly lateral (i.e. diagonal) rotation of one cervical onto another, which summed up together to enable a sufficient head elevation. This is consistent with the range of neck movement that would be possible based on the anteriormost border of the shell of A. barretoi , which is deeply notched (Meylan, 1996; Gaffney et al., 2006), which in turn would allow vertical displaceme nts of the posteriormost part of the neck (C7 -C8). On the other hand, lowering of the head would occurs in one of the main axes of the articulation ( figure 18) but would take place by moving the entire neck because of the limitations of zygapophyseal joint s (e.g. Taylor & Wedel, 2013). Neck retraction, in turn, could be possible by different angulations between CVs along the neck. For instance, the posteriormost part of the neck (C7 -C8) could slightly lower and bend while the midanterior one rotates to the opposed direction (as seen in AMNH 24454, figure 19; and in Taquetochelys decorata , Sereno & ElShafie, 2013, figs. 14.11 and 14.18) adjusting the elevation to allow an effective retraction. Movements like these herein described, nonetheless, remains to be tested biomechanically through 3D reconstruction of the neck together with its musculature.", "The cervical proportions of A. barretoi show distinction in CVs that aid in discussing these aspects (figure 9). The species has the lowest C7/C8 ratio (table 18) indicating a shorter posterior neck in comparison to other pelomedusoids, which is concordant with the notched shell (Meylan, 1996; Gaffney et al., 2006). Moreover, the proportions of CVs of the species point to a long extension of the midanterior part of t he neck, since A. barretoi owns the longest C3 -C5 sequence and has one of the shortest C2. These proportions “sequences” are different from long -neckeds chelids (figure 14) but may points to a mode of capture by spear -feeding, as in Chelodina -Hydromedusa (Pritchard, 1984), with distinct cervical lengths, since these species have similar vertebral morphology (Meylan, 1996; Kischlat, 2001; Broin et al., 2007).", "Figure 18 – Shape of articulations in Pelomedusoides by family.

Scale bar = 1 cm.", "2.3.3) Neck morphology and phylogenetic structure in wider, oval -shaped Pelomedusidae Pelomedusidae have wider tha n tall, oval -shaped articulations (Gaffney et al., 2006; pers. obs.). Thus, higher degree movements are allowed vertically than laterally (figure 18). This is might by related to the anterior extension of the prezygapophyses beyond the central limit in the anteriormost CVs (C3 -C4; pers. obs.) which in turn allow vertical movements of the head and neck complex. Variation across pelomedusids was rather smaller than podocnemidids and this is possibly a bias due to the low sample. Thus , improving sample would d emonstrate a higher variation, since pelomedusids are widespread across the African continent (Loveridge, 1941; Broadley, 1981; Chirio & Ineich, 2006; Kindler et al., 2016; TTWG, 2017), which account for different environments and seasonal changes that may influence species habits (e.g. Pelomedusa subrufa, Luiselli et al., 2011). Still, variations may be related to size, habitat, diet, or even all factors together. Differences between Pelusios chapini and Pelomedusa subrufa may be related to size and habita t, once the first is larger and lives in larger lakes and rivers whereas the second is smaller and lives in ponds and smaller rivers (Loveridge, 1941; Broadley, 1981). As a result, types of prey are also affected by the type of water system and thus also p lay a role in differentiation of the species.", "Pelomedusids varied most in the PC1 and PC3 ( figure 8); however, variation occurs on C8 only. Plots ( figure 9) confirmed this variation but highlights more variation in C3 instead of C2 and show variation in C7 too. Therefore, plots regarding C2 were mostly because of variation in other pelomedusoides than in pelomdusids. Nevertheless, differences are mostly in Pelusios subniger and could be due to the smaller size of this species (Loveridge, 1941; Broadley, 1981). Between Pelomedusoides, pelomedusids generally have shorter C6 and C7 as well as longer C8 ( figure 9), which were captured by PC1 and PC2. The longer C8 may be related to a higher, domed carapace in the family (Wise & Stayton, 2017). This relation is further supported by the fact that Pelomedusa shows lower C8 proportions (figure 9), and less domed carapace compared to Pelusios (Wise & Stayton, 2017). A t the same time, pelomedusids generally have relatively longer C2 comparing to Podocnemis spp. and Peltocephalus (i.e. saddle -shaped species) and Araripemys and Euraxemys (figure 9). Therefore, there is a clear phylogenetic structure in vertebral proportio ns between pelomedusoids lineages that distinguishes Pelomedusidae from others, an aspect that has never been pointed out.", "2.3.4) Neck morphology and convergence in wider, heart -shaped articulations Erymnochelys and Turkanemys have wider than tall articulations but differ from Pelomedusidae in having heart -shaped morphology (Gaffney et al., 2011). Still, they are alike in showing similar proportions on C2 and C5 ( figure 9) and thus close C2/C5 ratio to those of Pelomedusidae ( table 18). However, the posterior part of the neck (C6 -C8) is notably shared with other podocnemidids in having similar proportions and is considered herein an indication of a phylogenetic structure and constraint. Yet cervicals of Erymnochelys have anterio rly projected prezygapophyses (pers. obs.) which favor vertical movements of the neck as in Pelomedusidae. As they belong to different lineages (Sterli, 2010; Gaffney et al., 2011; Guillon et al., 2012; Shaffer et al., 2017; Ferreira et al., 2018), the mor phology of this portion of the neck on both clades are therefore a convergence. Moreover, these species also share wider than tall articulations and prezygapophyseal anteriorization in C3 -C4, as well as proportional elongation of C2. Nevertheless, Erymnoch elys-Turkanemys may have had the same ancestral podocnemidid allometry of C6 -C8, given similar proportions they showed (figure 9; table 18), which in turn can be related to the rather alike shell morphology compared to other podocnemidids (Wise & Stayton, 2017).", "The mechanics of movements along the neck are similar in the two lineages, but Erymnochelys -Turkanemys would move in a slightly different manner, with crescent movements ( figure 18) because of the heart -shaped articulation. A 3D reconstruction and biomechanical analysis is necessary to address this question, allied to a kinetic study as have been done with some chelids (Van Damme & Aerts, 1997; Aerts et al., 2001; Lemell 2.3.5) Neck length and morphology in saddle -shaped joints Podocnemidids have saddle -shaped articulations (Williams, 1950; Gaffney et al.,2011), which allow movements laterally and vertically ( figure 18; Kardong, 2016). All saddle -shaped species were clustered close to one another ( figure 8), irrespective of its classification, clearly representing one type of neck; yet larger species ( P. expansa and Pelt. dumerilianus ) were generally similar in having shorter C2 and longer C5 (figure 9A). They all had intermediate values of C2/C5 and C5/C8 ratios in comparison with other Pelomedusoides ( table 18). In addition, size differences were observed in ratios regarding the C8, which were lower ( table 18) in smaller species ( P. sexturbeculata and P. erythrocepha la; Pritchard & Trebbau, 1984). These species have longer C8 than larger species and this may indicate a size -related allometry in this cervical. This pattern was also observed among pelomedusids, with the smaller Pelusios subniger having longer C8 (figure 9). Although this remains to be more evaluated, there may have a relationship between the animal size and C8 length across Podocnemididae and Pelomedusidae, and potentially in Pelomedusoides.", "South American podocnemidids are all primarily herbivorous, mos tly eating seeds and fruits but often opportunistic (Pritchard & Trebbau, 1984; Fachín -Teran et al., 1995; Eisemberg et al., 2016; Cunha et al., 2020). Nevertheless, results did not allow any discussion regarding overall feeding differences (Eisemberg et a l., 2016). However, they live in the Amazon Basin, with enormous water volumes throughout, and this may provide an association between the type of articulation and the biology of these species. These turtles are commonly seen in large rivers and their trib utaries, as well as in lentic and calmer places such as ponds, floodplains, and streams (Pritchard & Trebbau, 1984; Eisemberg et al., 2016). Whatever the water body they are, these are generally voluminous in water capacity and deep, so that individuals mo ve along the water column (Eisemberg et al., 2016). When they need to feed, they just raise the neck vertically in order to grab the food item in the surface that usually fall from trees (Eisenberg et al., 2016), or maybe underwater. In order words, the hi gh volume of water across the Amazon Basin would favors vertical movements of the neck for grabbing food, because animals are generally surrounded by deep waters and there is no need for specific neck movements in directions other than vertical. On the oth er hand, changes in position of the neck underwater are done by rotating the body (i.e. using the members). Despite that, horizontal neck retraction is still necessary, and movements in both directions can be achieved with heterocoelic centra (figure 18; K ardong, 2016).", "Furthermore, there is a variety of food items Podocnemis spp. and Peltocephalus eat along the water margins, mostly comprised of fruits and seeds of several plant families (Fachín -Teran et al., 1995; Pérez -Emán & Paolillo, 1997; Balensiefer & Vogt, 2006; Ossa et al., 2011; Fachín -Teran & Vogt, 2014). Such an environmental conditions can be extended to the fossil record, with the existence of saddle -shaped joints in cervicals of the gigantic Stupendemys geographicus from the Miocene (Wood, 1976; Gaffney et al., 2011), which also lived in the voluminously flooded proto -Amazon Basin (Woo d, 1976; Cadena et al., 2020).", "Eisemberg et al. (2016) reviewed diet preferences between all Amazonian podocnemidids and found no evidence of phylogenetic structure, but an indirect influence of water types where species occur, related to digestive tract m orphology and surrounding flora in each water type. From the species herein sampled, P. expansa and P. unifilis occur in clear, black, and white waters; P. erythrocephala and Peltocephalus occur in black waters; and P. sextuberculata occur in white water. There was no structure regarding habitat in ordination analyses (figure 8). On the contrary, species of the same water type were closer or similar to species of a different water type (e.g. P. sextuberculata closer to P. unifilis ; figure 8). Therefore, nec k length and cervical proportions do not seem to relate neither to diet nor habitat preference, but instead points to a general evolution of the species within the Amazon basin.", "Finally, the plots of Peltocephalus in ordination analyses demonstrate a varia tion clearly related to the saddle -shaped articulation, given the species was closer to Podocnemis spp. in PCAs ( figure 8). Phylogenetically, Peltocephalus has been generally regarded either within the Erymnochelys group, thus closer to Erymnochelys -Turkan emys (Cadena et al., 2010; Gaffney et al., 2011; Cadena, 2015; Ferreira et al., 2018a,b; Cadena et al., 2020) than to Podocnemis ; or as sister -group to Erymnochelys -Podocnemis (Seddon et al., 1997; Georges et al., 1998; Vargaz -Ramírez et al., 2008; Guillon et al., 2012). Regarding its position within the clade, similarity to Podocnemis in plots seems to be due to the same articulation type between both species, thus possibly due to similar feeding habits (Pérez -Emán & Paolillo, 1997; Ossa et al., 2011).", "2.3.6) Euraxemys and the types of neck in Pelomedusoides This is the first time pelomedusoids neck are compared quantitatively. From PCA results (figure 8) it is possible to consider four types of neck separated by the shape articulation surfaces. These ar e (1) Araripemys , with triangular -shaped articulations; (2) Erymnochelys -Turkanemys , with wider, heart -shaped articulations; (3) Podocnemis spp. and Peltocephalus , with saddle -shaped, with the addition of Euraxemys with taller, rounded joints; (4) and Pelo medusidae with wider, oval articulations. However, Euraxemys has different articulations along the neck (these are neither saddle -shaped nor oval-shaped nor triangular; pers. obs), which could represent a fifth type of neck with proportional similarities t o the saddle -shaped species.", "A general pattern of cervical proportion in Pelomedusoides can be seen (figure 9): variations in the midanterior portion of the neck (C2 -C5), but restricted to phylogenetic structure (i.e. family/subfamily); and a trend of incr easing in the midposterior (C6 -C7), followed by a deep decrease in C8. Euraxemys reflects the general pattern of Podocnemi sand Peltocephalus : increasing proportion from C2 -C7 followed by a deep decrease in C8; while Araripemys is unique in having a high i ncrease in C3 -C4 followed by decreasing in C5 -C8, probably due to the long neck and the triangular -shape articulation. In addition, Araripemys and pelomedusids can be differentiated from podocnemidids and Euraxemys in having shorter C6. Thus, our results s uggest there is a phylogenetic structure in these cervical proportions that needs more attention in character statement construction for phylogenetic analyses.", "Euraxemys share similar proportions to the smaller Podocnemis species, P.", "erythrocephala and P. sextuberculata (Pritchand & Trebbau, 1984; Eisemberg et al., 2016), such as in C2, C5 and C7 ( Figure 9). This result can be due to the similar size of the three species ( Euraxemys carapace length roughly 25cm, pers. obs.). However, it needs more evaluation given the rather different morphology of Euraxemys cervicals. The neural spines of C3 and C4 are as developed as in long -necked chelids Hydromedusa and Chelodina , and the centrum of C8 is rather arched dorsally (pers. obs.). Moreover, the species has fused postzygapophyses as in Araripemys (Gaffney & Meylan, 1991; Gaffney et al., 2006). These morphologies may point to a different muscular a rchitecture and mechanics of neck movement s, perhaps related to a similar environment both species had lived (Gaffney et al., 2006).", "Araripemys in turn showed proportions similar to Podocnemis or podocnemidids in C2, C5 and C8 while it was similar to pelomedusids in C6 -C7 (figure 9); it was differ ent only in C3 -C4. Therefore, even though it is only speculative, it looks like a phylogenetic similarity is portioned expressed differently along the neck, sometimes resembling one or another family pattern.", "3) Cervical constraints on pleurodiran lineages The main observed result between pleurodires is that there is a tight relationship between cervical variation and the articulation type they show; these ultimately distinguish Chelidae and Pelomedusoides (Williams, 1950; Gaffney et al., 2006; Joyce, 2007) . Chelids have the articular formula as follows: (2(3(4(5)6)7(8), i.e. opisthocoelous C2-C4, bicovex C5 and C8, procoelous C6 and biconcave C7. The formula of pelomedusoids is (2)3)4)5)6)7)8), i.e. biconvex C2 and procoelous C3 -C8 (e.g. Gaffney et al., 200 6; Joyce, 2007). The variation found herein is thus related mostly to common ancestry and thus with a phylogenetic constraint to cervical length. Such constraint may turn difficult to recognize variation by morphotype.", "For instance, variation in short -neck eds were mainly due to podocnemidids and pelomedusids, whereas long -neckeds varied mostly in C2 due to chelids, but Araripemys showed to be significantly different from them ( figures 10 and 11), probably because of being a pelomedusoid and owing a different type of articulation. In addition, pelomedusoids demonstrated to be highly variable in PC1 (figure 11), though not as much as chelids; and considering short -neckeds, they accounted to most of the variance within the morphotype (figur e 10). Whatever the group distribution, variation occurred mostly on Pelomedusoides, which have procoelous vertebrae (Gaffney et al., 2006; Broin et al., Differences between Chelidae and Pelomedusoides could also be seen in the separate d analyses, by considering the components and the importance of vertebrae (tables 9 and 11). Chelids had a relatively well distribution of loadings of PC1, but C2 played a much important role in structuring them; in pelomedusoids, loadings were less distri buted but there was not a preponderance of C2, instead it was almost equal to C8, while C5 also accounted its relevance. PC2 accounted overly for the posteriormost part of the neck in both clades, but they also had differences: variation in chelids were mo re restricted to C7 -C8, while it included C6 -C8 in pelomedusoids. Lastly, PC3 were important for pelomedusoids with majority of variance in C2 and C8, but other vertebrae were somehow important (C4 and C5).", "These variations were comprised in PCA with both clades together (table 13) and were relevant in classifying the types of neck (table 15) but had less accuracy (53.33%) in clades classifications, with five Pelomedusoides as Chelidae and nine Chelidae (almost all short -neckeds) as Pelomedusoides. On the o ther hand, morphological/subtypes classifications had better accuracy (70%), with three Pelomedusoides and two Chelidae species classified into the other clade’s subtype. By joining both groups into a single classification (i.e. clade + morphological/subty pes), and using LDA results of table 15, accuracy decreased to 43.33% (table 19). This means phylogeny, articular morphology and cervical proportions are not entire related one another across Pleurodira lineages.", "Table 19 – LDA results and accuracy using PCA scores and joining clade and morphology of cervicals (for Pelomedusoides) or subtypes (for Chelidae) into classifications.

Curiously, at the same time the species has the longest C2, it also has the shortest C5 and one of the shorte st C8 ( figure 14). The most basic difference between these cervicals regards the type of articulation, namely opisthocoelous in C2 and biconvex in C5 and C8 (Williams, 1950). Therefore, the disparity between cervicals length/proportion within the same neck occurs because of mechanical roles they play depending on the type of articulation each cervical present. Moreover, although elongation is necessary to achieve a long neck, it does not necessarily must occur mostly in one vertebra but instead can occur in a sequence, as in Araripemys (C3-C5), forming modules. This indicates there is a degree of independence of development and growth between vertebrae that have been Types of short necks are numerous and not easy to distinct. They comprise a large variation that mostly relates to C2, C7 and C8. Few indications of phylogenetic relationship were obser ved in South American and Australasian short -necked chelids, though, and points out to future anatomic comparisons between them.", "This study also investigated the effect of estimations on missing data and found that estimations are rather affected by sample s with unbalanced missingness proportions. Having a good sample number is important, but it was found that having a matrix as balanced as possible (i.e. similar missing data per variable) is much more, since estimations of a character mostly rely on observ ed values of the same. The recommendation is to not ignore missing data and be conscious when choosing a method of estimation. Even more important, however, is to check the distribution of MD in the matrix first, followed by checking estimations by some me thod. PCA was demonstrated to be a good method for inspect MDs and thus is recommended, once biased estimated specimens were structured in dubious positions onto PC axes. Additionally, using other methods in composition, such as correlation analyses, are a lso recommended. Finally, the analyses using proportions have been demonstrated to be useful to study allometric patterns within a clade and allow to recognize and compare species with only one or few specimens, as was the case of Araripemys, Turkanemys and Euraxemys as well as of many fossil species. Although allometries of these species were assessed indirectly, trends and comparisons were possible to investigate once the species could be included in the analyses. Still, proportions are useful in evaluate different patterns and groups (e.g. morphotypes, clades, habitats) in a qualitative mode by using simple statistical techniques (e.g. box or line -plots, ANOVAs) as well as more complex (discriminants and PCAs). The approach is not itself a novelty, but it yields potential to elucidates several patterns of the vertebrate body, especially the neck and vertebral column.", "REFERENCES Aerts, P., V an Damme , J. & H errel, A.

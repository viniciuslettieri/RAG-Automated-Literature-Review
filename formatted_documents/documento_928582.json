Data from the 420 -day monitoring experiment were analysed using a statistical tool. Membrane -based tec hnologies stand out for their high cost -benefit. NF and RO systems removed organic matter, reported as chemical oxygen demand (COD), absorbance at 254 nm (UV 254), and ammonia nitrogen at removal efficiencies higher than 90%. The leachate treatment operating costs ranged from 0.132 to 3.35 USD per m3 of treated leachate. In contrast, the management of the concentrated leachate generated by membrane filtration processes is not considered when the expenses for NF/RO implementation are estimated. Concentrate str eams are commonly re - introduced into the landfill without additional cost for landfill managers. However, the consequences of this practice are not well -known, and the literature's findings show contrasting conclusions. Our assessment using simulated landf ill cells indicated that membrane concentrate infiltration increases the organic content of methanogenic leachates. The pollution parameters' median values were higher in leachates drained from cells that operated with concentrate recirculation (i.e., 6729 vs 1367 mg L-1 [COD], 33.39 vs 17.39 cm-1 [UV 254]; p-value < 0.05). The recalcitrant organics' accumulation impacted the RO treatment efficiency by increasing organic fouling onto the membrane surface. In that direction, greener solutions for the leachate membrane concentrate management are recommended to guarantee the long -term sustainability of the leachate treatment chain. In this scenario, the use of leachate concentrate residue in the pyrolysis process of agroindustrial biomass was investigated to pro duce add -value products.

The document structure and a state ment of novelty and contribution are presented. The publications from this work are listed at the end of this chapter .", "1.1 BACKGROUND", "Landfill leachate (LFL) contains a wide range of pollutants of varying concentrations, from high values for organic matter, nut rients, and inorganics to low values for emerging contaminants (e.g., persistent organic pollutants, pharmaceuticals, personal care products, and plastic additives) ( BUSCH et al., 2010; CLARKE et al., 2015; RAMAKRISHNAN et al., 2015). Hence, its treatment remains a major socio -environmental and economic issue in the municipal solid waste management chain. Treatment of LFLs must meet the wastewater disposal requirements established by regulatory authorities. Moreover, con sidering that the leachate physicochemical composition undergoes spatial and temporal variations, successful and efficient treatment must be ensured in both the active and post -closure landfill periods ( FAN et al., 2006; STEGMANN , 2018).", "The conventional technologies for leachate treatment are biological and physicochemical processes or their combination in integrated or sequential schemes (ABBAS et al., 2009; KURNIAWAN et al., 2010). Conventional biological systems alone cannot significantly treat methanogenic leachates, which contain contaminants resistant to biodegradation ( TORRETTA et al., 2016). Additionally, high ammonia concentrations cannot be removed successfully by biological treatment, such as activated sludge, aerated lagoons, seque nce batch reactor, or trickling filters ( MOJIRI et al., 2021). Therefore, the option of advanced technologies should be considered. In this regard, membrane -based techniques (e.g., nanofiltration [NF] and reverse osmosis [RO]) have been demonstrated to be indispensable for leachate treatment due to their cost -effectiveness ( CHEN et al., 2021).", "NF and RO are high -pressure -driven membrane filtration processes. Membrane systems generate two output streams, which are named permeate and concentrate. The permeat e is the treated water, and the concentrate, also known as retentate, is the residual stream ( BAKER , 2012). A body of scientific studies recognizes NF and RO's importance for wastewater treatment, and several works have shown NF/RO treating landfill leacha te in pilot and full -scale applications. On the other hand, economic data in the literature are scarce . Furthermore, companies that run leachate treatment plants do not provide the actual process costs. Therefore, more information on this matter would help landfill managers and stakeholders to make smarter decisions.", "Another significant aspect of membrane -based technologies is the management of concentrate streams. Due to its convenience and simplicity, the recirculation of membrane concentrate onto the la ndfill body is a commonly adopted management strategy in a leachate membrane -based treatment chain (ISWA, 2019). However, the negative experience of concentrate recirculation in some sites started to grow the debate about its long -term sustainability. Lite rature findings are contrasting in this matter, and research is still needed to elucidate the impacts of the concentrate infiltration practice on the leachate treatment chain.", "The present thesis explores the technological and economic aspects of NF and RO treating landfill leachate. Besides, the impacts of concentrate recirculation, using experimental landfill cells, on the quantity, quality, and leachate treatment performance are investigated.", "1.2 OBJECTIVES", "1.2.1 Main aim", "The main aim of this t hesis is to e valuate the impacts of the recirculation process of concentrate streams , using experimental landfill cells, on the leachate quantit y, quality , and treatment performance.", "1.2.2 Goals", "i.

Chapter two presents a brief literature overview on the main aspects of landfill leachate management and membrane -based technologies (i.e., nanofiltration and reverse osmosis) .

The fifth chapter presents a state -of-art review about concentrate leachate management options, highlighting perspectives for future studies. Chapter six analysis the results of a 420 -day monitoring experiment to assess the impacts of the membrane concentrate infiltration practice. Chapter seven address es an innovative strategy to handle mem brane concentrate streams. This section aims to provide insights into alternative approaches for membrane concentrate management within a circular bioeconomy context. Finally, major conclusions of this thesis are drawn in chapter eight .", "The thesis structu re based on its organisation and goals is illustrated in Figure", "Figure 1-1 Thesis structure.", "1.4 STATEMENT OF NOVELTY AND CONTRIBUTION", "Membrane -based technologies have been used in several landfill facilities to treat wastewaters efficiently, but concentrate management is by far a critical issue for the leachate treatment chain.

Second, to the best of the author’s knowledge, a comprehensive literature review about leachate concentrate management focusing on membrane concentrate valorisation is presented for the first time. Finally, an innovative management solution based on the pyrolysis of the membrane concentrate residue is proposed and evaluated in a bench -scale experiment, which provides insights into alternative approaches for managing concentrate streams within a circular bioeconomy scenario.", "1.5 PUBLICATIONS Article papers [1] Appendix I.

Theoretical Approach", "This chapter provides a brief background about landfill leachate management and membrane -based technologies (i.e., nanofiltration and reverse osmosis) . It presents a literature overview concerning nanofiltration and reverse osmosis applications for leachate treatment. Fundamental principles discussed herein act as a groundwork for experiments and discussion of subsequent chapters.", "2.1 LANDFILL LEACHATE MANAGEMENT", "The composition of landfill leachate (LFL) varies depending on the gravimetric composition of landfilled waste, landfill age and mode of its operation, landfill status (i.e., active or closed), site conditions (e.g., climate, site geometry, soil properties , and geohydrology), among others (EL-FADEL et al., 2002; FARQUHAR, 1989) . The typical LFL contains a significant concentration of biodegradable and non -biodegradable organics, inorganic compounds, and xenobiotic organic compounds (KULIKOWSKA & KLIMIUK, 20 08; VACCARI et al., 2019) . Recent studies identified other pollutants such as pharmaceuticals, plasticizers, and microplastics in untreated and treated leachate samples from both active and closed landfills (HE et al., 2019; SU et al., 2019) . Thus, a consi derable amount of literature about this topic can be expected in the forthcoming years. Nevertheless, major concerns of the landfill leachate are ammonia nitrogen (NH 3-N), salts (e.g., chloride, sulphate, carbonate, and bicarbonate), and organic matter – reported as five -day biochemical oxygen demand (BOD 5), chemical oxygen demand (COD), and total organic carbon (TOC) (EHRIG & ROBINSON, 2010; ISKANDER et al., 2018) .", "According to published studies (COSTA et al., 2019; KURNIAWAN et al., 2010, 2006) , landfill age plays an important role in leachate characteristics and; therefore, landfill leachate can be classified into three categories on an age basis: young, intermediate, and mature ( Table 2-1). Overall, biodegradable organic matter (evaluated by BOD 5) reduces over time, and leachate organic matter stabilizes (KJELDSEN et al., 2002; LUO et al., 2020) . In other words, the BOD 5/COD ratio (biodegrada bility index) decreases with the landfill age increases. The biodegradability index can even be more diminutive in tropical regions compared to others of temperate climate. The warmer conditions tend to boost microbial activity, which accelerates organic m atter stabilization; thus, a high concentration of non -biodegradable compounds such as humic substances can also be a concern in the short term for landfills located in tropical regions (LEBRON et al., 2021) . Besides, as earlier stated, the composition of landfilled residues can affect LFL characteristics; for instance, in regions where waste separation, pretreatment, and recycling of organic fraction are effective, inorganic leachate parameters such as total d issolved solids (TDS), conductivity, and chlorid e may be more relevant (DE ALMEIDA & CAMPOS, 2020) .", "Several methods for landfill leachate treatment have been in use, such as co - treatment with sewage on wastewater treatment plants (BRENNAN et al., 2017; DERELI et al., 202 1), leachate recirculation into the landfill body (BAE et al., 2019) , constructed wetlands (BAKHSHOODEH et al., 2020) , physicochemical processes ─ coagulation -flocculation (C/F), chemical precipitation, chemical oxidation, air stripping, carbon adsorption, and AOPs (DENG & ENGLEHARDT, 2006; FERNANDES et al., 2015; FERRAZ et al., 2013; FOO & HAMEED, 2009; LINS et al., 2015) , and biological processes ─ aerated lagoons, sequencing batch reactor process, activated sludge process (ASP), membrane bioreactor (MBR), biofilms in rotating biological contactors, and trickling filters (AHMED & LAN, 2012; EL -GOHARY & KAMEL, 2016; ROBINSON,", "Conventional treatments of LFLs are generally classified into three major groups: (1) biological processes (aerobic or anaerobic); (2) physicochemical processes; and (3) a combination of biological and physicochemical processes (Luo et al., 2020) . Biological treatment is often used to re move biodegradable organics and total nitrogen due to its reliability, simplicity, and high cost -effectiveness (EHRIG et al., 2018) . On the other hand, physical and chemical processes can be effective as a pretreatment for leachate’s biological degradation since it helps to reduce the content of non -biodegradable substances, which can compromise the efficiency of the biological treatment (MOJIRI et al., 2021) . Figure 2-1 depicts the performance of different leachate treatment processes according to the landfill age, i.e., young, intermediate, and mature.", "Table 2-1 Typical landfill leachate physicochemical composition according to the landfill age in temperate and tropical regions.

(2020) .", "As above -mentioned, several technologies are available for LFL treatment, and each of them has its merits and limitations. The selection of the best treatment route depends mainly on the LFL composition and economic feasibility. As leachate composition und ergoes spatial and seasonal variation, treatment strategies cannot be stereotyped. Every scenario is unique, and treatment approaches should vary accordingly (MUKHERJEE et al., 2015) .", "From a techno -economic point of view, NF and RO seem to be the most promising and efficient methods among the existing technologies. NF and RO, either as a foremost or polishing step in a leachate treatment chain, have shown to be an essential manner to meet the most restrictive standards for water discharge or reuse (CHEN et al., 2021) . NF and RO processes can: 1) provide high -quality treated leachate (CHEN et al., 2021) ; 2) reduce the environmental footprint and size of the landfill leachate treatment plant ( LLTP ) (modular design/installation) (JAMALY et al., 2014; PETER -VARBANETS et al., 2009) ; 3) be automated and easily scaled (PETER - VARBANETS et al., 2009) , and; 4) be easily moved from site to site (KUMANO & FUJIWARA, 2008) . Since the late 1980s, the use of RO has become a proven technology in use for LFL treatmen t. In 2018, there were over 300 leachate treatment RO plants installed worldwide (BALKEMA et al., 2018) . For this reason and considering the scope of the present thesis, the following section focuses on NF/RO processes applied to the treatment of LFLs.", "2.2 NANOFILTRATION AND REVERSE OSMOSIS", "2.2.1 Fundamental concepts", "Nanofiltration (NF) and reverse osmosis (RO) are high -pressure -driven membrane filtration processes. NF/RO systems generate two output streams during their operation: named permeate and concentrate. The permeate is the treated water , and the concentrate, also known as retentate, is the residual stream ( Figure 2-2)", "Figure 2-2 Schematic diagram of the membrane filtration process. Source: Adapted from Y e et al. (2018).", "There essential parameters determine the performance of membrane -based processes : solvent permeability or flux through the membrane, rejection of solutes, and yield or recovery of the membrane -based unit. The permeate flux (J [L m-2 h-1]) is defined as the permeate flowrate per membrane ’s permeation area (Equation 2.1) , while the membrane permeability (Lp [L m-2 h-1 bar-1]) is the permeate flux per unit of applied pressure (Equation 2.2) .", "𝐽=𝑄𝑝", "𝐿𝑝= 𝐽", "Where: Qp (L h-1) is permeate flow rate, A m represent s the membrane’s permeation area (m2), and PTM is the transmembrane pressure (bars).", "The rejection of solute “i” is defined by Equation 2.2.", "Where cp,i is the permeate concentration and c f,i is the feed concentration of solute “i”; Rejection is a dimensionless parameter , and its value varies between 100% (complete rejection of the solute) and 0% (solute and solvent pass freely through the membrane) (BAKER, 2012 ; URAGAMI, 2017 ).", "The r ecovery of membrane -based system (R [%]) is the ratio of the permeate stream (Qp) to the feed stream flowrate (Q f) (Equation 2.4). It should be noted that the recovery parameter is linked to the design of an industrial application rather than a membrane characteristic (URAGAMI, 2019).", "The RO process uses a physical mechanism in which the operating pressure must be kept higher than the solution osmotic pressure (∆P>∆π) (Figure 2-3). The transport mechanism across the RO membrane follows the dissolution/diffusion model, where both solvent and solute dissolve in the dense surface layer of the membrane and diffuse separat ely due to the chemical potential gradient of each species. In wastewater treatment systems, RO membranes are primarily used to remove low molecular mass solutes such as salts and heavy metals (BAKER, 2012; WILF, 2014) .", "Figure 2-3 Reverse osmosis mechanism principles. Source : Adapted from Kim et al. (2021.)", "NF membranes have pore sizes of 0.5─2 nm, corresponding to a molecular weight cut -off (MWCO) of 100─500 Da. NF is also described as a process that removes particles and dissolved compounds smaller than 2 nm (MOHAMMAD et al., 2015) . The principle of NF is very similar to that of RO but there are a just slight difference between RO and NF process es. RO membrane re jects monovalent ion as Na+ and Cl- ions and easily permeates water. However, NF membrane s do not almost reject monovalent ion, reject multivalent ions such as Ca+2 and Mg+2 and permeate water. Therefore, a higher driving force in the pressure -driven separation process is required for RO system s but not for the NF process (ABDEL -FATAH, 2018; BAKER, 2012; URAGAMI, 2017) . NF and RO systems can separate organic and inorganic compounds from the influent, producing water with low levels of dissolved solids", "The standard operating mode of full -scale NF/RO systems is cross -flow with high internal flow rate concentrate recirculation. Typical NF/RO systems modules include tubular, spiral wound, hollow fib re, and disc tube (YANG et al., 2020) . The higher cost -benefit of the spiral wound module makes it the most used configuration. Spiral wound modules are available in standardized’ design, in a range of standard diameters (2.5 ,4 and 8 inches) to fit pressure vessels that can hold several modules in series connected by O -rings. The module uses flat sheet membranes wrapped around a central tube. The membranes are glued along three edges over a permeate spacer to form ‘leaves’. The permeate spacer supports the membrane and conducts the permeate to the central permeate tube (Figure 2-4) (MAYNARD & WHAPHAM,", "Figure 2-4 Spiral wound module design. Source : Maynard & Whapham (2020)", "Due to their modular configuration, NF/RO modules are available in containers from various suppliers and adapted to the required condition s. NF/RO spiral wound systems are generally used in a stand -alone mode, and depending on the effluent requirements, several steps can be combined, where wastew ater gets filtered in two or more steps before final discharge (DE ALMEIDA et al., 2020 ; ISWA, 2019 ).", "2.2.2 NF/RO processes in the leachate treatment chain", "NF and RO have been widely applied in full -scale LFL treatment projects (CHEN et al., 2021; DI MARIA et al., 2018; LEBRON et al., 2021) . A body of scientific research recognizes their importance for LFL treatment (ANNA TAŁAŁAJ et al., 2021; DOLAR et al., 2 016; MARIAM & NGHIEM , 2010; RAMASWAMI et al., 2018; SMOL & WŁODARCZYK -MAKUŁA , 2017) , and several studies have operated NF/RO in pilot and full -scale application ( Table 2-2), demonstrating the membrane technology maturity. For example, according to Argun et al. (2020) , the NF process used as a final step of an LFL facility located in Turkey is essential to meet the local leachate disposal limits. The NF system is composed of 60 spiral wound modules and polyethersulfone membranes. It operates at pump pressure <18 bar, recovery rate of 85%, and permeate flux of 16 L m-2 h-1. COD, NH 3-N, TDS, and colour removal effi ciencies are, on average, 84%, 70%, 51%, and >99%, respectively. Several full -scale RO systems are also documented in other studies that looked at the RO process (CINGOLANI et al., 2018; RUKAPAN et al., 2012; THEEPHARAKSAPAN et al., 2011) . In Poland, a 72 m3 d-1 LLTP has performed the disc -tube RO system at an operating pressure of 65 bar, permeate flux of up to 50 L m-2 h-1 and recovery of 75%. Treatability results showed removal efficiencies of BOD 5, COD, and NH 3-N greater than 90% (TALALAJ , 2015) .", "Table 2-2 NF and RO in the pilot - and full -scale application for landfill leachate treatment.

Membrane fouling requires extensive pretreatment or chemical cleaning of the membrane, resulting in a short lifespan of membranes. That is still the bottleneck problem in membrane promotion and application, as fouling can also increase operational costs. Before NF/RO filtration, pretreatment steps are taken to remove suspended solids and colloids and, consequently, prevent fouling and biofilm growth on the membrane surface (JAMALY", "Membrane f ouling can be represented by a resistances -in-serie model (Equation 2.5). Resistances in serie represent the theoretical resistance to permeate flux due to a build -up of a layer of dirt or other fouling substances onto the membrane surface (COLLADO et al., 20 20).", "𝐽= 𝑇𝑀𝑃 𝜇𝑅𝑓=𝑇𝑃𝑀", "Where TMP is the transmembrane pressure (kg m−1 s -2), μ is the dynamic viscosity (kg m s−1), R f is the total fouling resistance, R M is the intrinsic membrane resistance and R rev., R irrev. and R irrecov. are the reversible, irreversible and irrecoverable fouling resistances, respectively (all resistances in m-1). In a practical way, reversible fouling is removed by physical cleaning, irreversible fouling is eliminated by chemical cleaning , and irrecoverable fouling refers to those foulants that cannot be removed by any cleaning step (COLLADO et al., 2020; URUGAMI, 2017 ).", "Finally, a challenge must be dealt with is managing membrane concentrate streams. The development of technologies and pr ocess breakthroughs in the water desalination field have been helping to tackle the concentrate management issue in other areas. There is a pool of patented technologies to improve the overall feed water recovery, aiming to reduce concentrate volume and ac hieve minimal liquid discharge (MLD) or zero liquid discharge (ZLD) (JOO & TANSEL, 2015; SUBRAMANI & JACANGELO, 2014) . However, their high costs linked mainly to energy requirements limit the implementation of full -scale ZLD systems. Furthermore, it is imp ortant to note that MLD/ZLD systems are associated with unintended environmental impacts as a result of their high energy demand and carbon footprint. Other major issues of MLD/ZLD systems include fouling, scaling, and expensive metallic materials (VOUTCHK OV & KAISER, 2020) . Therefore, future research to addresses these drawbacks are needed. The membrane concentrate management from leachate treatment plants is compre hensively reviewed in Chapter 5 of this thesis .", "REFERENCES", "ABDEL -FATAH, M. A.

The current chapter provides an overlook of techno -economic aspects of the nanofiltration technology for landfill leachate treatment. Nanofiltration was performed using a b ench -scale filtration module with commercial polymeric membranes. At the end of each filtration, a cleaning protocol was applied to recover the initial membrane permeability. The concentration of recalcitrant compounds, expressed as humic substances, was r educed from 821±86 to 84±8 mg L−1 in the permeate , and chemical oxygen demand complied with the wastewater discharge standards imposed by local legislation.

Nanofiltration applied to the landfill leachate treatment and preliminary cost estimation. Waste Manag. Res. J. a Sustain. Circ. Econ , 38(10), p.", "3.1 INTRODUCTION", "Landfill leachate treatment is expensive, multi -processed, and different from each other due to the complex composition, high loading, and seasonal variation ( LIU et al., 2015). Several technologies and treatment schemes are available for their treatment (DE ALMEIDA et al., 2019; DI MARIA et al., 2018; RENOU et al., 2008; TALALAJ et al., 2019) : (1) co-treatment of sewage and leachate on the site or transfer to the central wastewat er treatment plant; (2) recirculation into the bioreactor landfill body; (3) physicochemical treatment (coagulation -flocculation, precipitation, chemical oxidation, activated carbon adsorption); (4) biological processes (anaerobic treatment, aerated lagoon s, activated sludge plants, membrane bioreactor (MBR), biofilms in rotating biologic contractors, and trickling filters); and (5) membrane processes (main nanofiltration and reverse osmosis). Despite this, to provide a treated effluent that can be discharg ed into natural water streams or reused, one single treatment technology is not available and a combination of treatment technologies is essential.", "The selection of the best treatment scheme depends on the characteristics of the leachate, extent of treatm ent required, and economic parameters. Reported studies have shown that although biological processes are widely applied for leachate treatment ( FERNANDES et al., 2017), this is not sufficient in reaching the existing discharge standards due to the recalcitrance, i.e., the presence of non -biodegradable and/or low biodegradable compounds (CAMPOS et al., 2013; TALALAJ et al., 2019), characteristic of the matu re landfill leachate.", "The refractory organic is mainly humic substances (HS). According to Lima et al. (2017), HS can increase the solubility of hydrophobic compounds and solubilize metals such as Ni, Cd, and Zn by complexation, modifying the bioavailabil ity and biotoxicity of landfill pollutants. The presence of the refractory organic matter in the leachate illustrates the complexity of this type of wastewater, limiting the efficiency of biological processes. Thus, for the removal of these compounds, adva nced treatments such as membrane filtration are required.", "Leachate treatment by membrane process has received much attention over the last two decades. Typical membrane technologies include reverse osmosis (RO), nanofiltration (NF), and ultrafiltration (U F) (BAKER , 2012). Separation efficiency depends on the type and molecular size of leachate contaminants, the membranes used, and the operational pressure ( ZIREHPOUR & RAHIMPOUR , 2016).", "Yao (2013) points out that NF technology is capable of achieving several objectives regarding leachate treatment, e.g., control of organic, inorganic, and microbial contaminants. Comparatively, the advantage of using an NF membrane is the request for lower operating pressures, and has higher fluxes than RO mem branes, better retention than a UF membrane, high rejection of polyvalent ions and organic matter with a molecular weight of 200 -1000 Da, and has relatively low operating and maintenance costs ( YAO , 2013). Moreover, due to its unique properties as compared to UF and RO membranes, the NF membrane has a significant advantage that is the capability to remove recalcitrant organic matter from landfill leachate ( CHAUDHARI &", "Fernandes et al. (2017) stressed that most of the conventional biological and physicochemical technologies implemented at the landfill facilities are not capable to treat leachates efficiently and are currently being replaced by/or complemented with membrane technologies. Also, Brazilian researchers have highlighted the need to use efficient and economically viable technologies for the treatment of leachate in Brazilian landfills (COSTA et al., 2019; DE ALMEIDA et al., 2019). However, to the best of our knowledge , the most advanced leachate treatment technologies are not feasible in most of the municipalities due to, for instance, the high cost of implementation and maintenance, and the volumes of leachate to be treated. Consequently, municipalities are required t o implement treatment processes that are incompatible with the characteristics of the leachate, resulting in treated leachate on disagreement with established disposal legislation.", "Previous studies focused on the i nvestigation of the technical feasibility of NF. However, there are a limited number of works that examined leachate treatment costs. Also, companies that run leachate treatment plants do not provide this data. Within this context, to cover this knowledge gap, the purpose of this work was to asse ss the efficiency of the NF process and estimate the costs involved in a full -scale NF plant used as a final treatment for landfill leachate.", "3.2 MATERIALS AND METHODS", "3.2.1 Sample characterization", "This study has used the leachate pre -treated by physicochemical process from the Seropédica landfill, located in Rio de Janeiro State, Brazil. The samples used were obtained from a previous bench -scale investigation ( DE ALMEIDA et al., 2020).", "The Seropédi ca landfill activities started in April 2012 and permitted Gramacho dumpsite closure, which had been the largest dumpsite in operation in Latin American from 1976 to 2012. Seropédica landfill receives over 10,000 tons of waste per day. It operates with the reception, treatment, and final disposal of solid waste from non - hazardous industry activities and municipal solid waste (MSW). The physical composition of MSW shows that, as expected for low - and middle -income countries, organic matter is the main fracti on (> 50%).

Membrane and housings acquisition costs are approximately 25 -35% of the total investment value ( SALEHI et al., 2014). Most membrane modules are pr ovided with their housing. The cost of membranes and housings was calculated from the square meter cost of membranes ( GUERRA & PELLEGRINO , 2012) (Eq uation 3.1).", "Where: C mem (US$): cost of membranes; C mem/m2 (US$ m-2): cost related to 1 m2 of membrane; A m (m2): total permeation area.", "The membrane area required for the operation of the NF -plant depends on the design permeate flow rate, and permeate flux of polymeric membrane used (Eq uation 3.2).

The routine maintenance time and membrane integrity test are estimated in hours per day.", "For a cost estimate regarding pumps, the total cost was estimated by multiplying the pump cost by the number of modules in the plant (Salehi et al., 2014). The peripheral price that includes costs with valves, pipes, and instrumentation was estimated at 20% of the membrane cost (Guerra and Pellegrino, 2012). The startup cost, which is the amount of capital required to start the operation, corresponding to 8% of fixed investment, was also consi dered as investment cost (Amaral et al., 2016).", "For the composition of OPEX, the costs of energy consumption for the operation of the NF system, investment depreciation, membrane exchange, maintenance, hand labor, and membrane cleaning were included ( SINGH & CHERYAN , 1998). The energy required to operate the full -scale NF -unit was estimated at 25% of the membrane costs ( SINGH & CHERYAN , 1998). A percentage of 5% of the initial investment associated with preventive and corrective maintenance o f the membrane was considered as maintenance cost. As an estimated cost of chemicals used to clean the membranes, a value of 2% of the initial investment. Investment depreciation is typically considered for a period from 7 to 14 years ( SALEHI et al., 2014) . The membrane costs are not included in this estimate and are considered an independent operating expense.

However, the samples show some typical properties of mature leachate because of the substantial concentration of organic matter (COD, 2258±230 mg L-1). Likewise, BOD 5/COD (0.21) has indicated low biodegradability. Besides, the average concentration of HS was 821±86 mg L-1 and UV 254, which indicates the aromatic organic matter contents , varied from 13 to 15 cm-1. Also, all the samples were characterized by a very high conten t in dissolved salts, notably chlorides (585±73 mg L-1) and conductivity (13±1 mS cm-1). These characteristics fits well with Costa et al. (2019) and also confirms our earlier results ( DE ALMEIDA et al., 2020).", "Alfaia et al. (2017) pointed out that about 51.4% of the municipal solid waste deposited in Brazilian landfills is composed of organic matter. This may be the reason for the high organic content of the leachate from this site. On the other hand, the treatability of landfill leachate depends on its composition and characteristics. Thus, leachate characteristics such as organic matter (COD, BOD 5/COD ratio, HS) are determinants for the selection of suitable treatment.", "In our view, the physicochemical and biological leachate treatment processes applied at this site are incompatible with the characteristics of the leachate, resulting in treated leachate on disagreement with Brazilian legislation. Therefore, a further treatment process is needed. In this respect, NF represents a sound technology to complement leachate treatment because it has the advantages of providing a high permeate flux at low operating pressure and maintaining a high organic matter rejection rate ( CHAUDHARI & MURTHY , 2010; DE ALMEIDA et al., 2019 ).", "3.3.2 Nanofiltration process", "3.3.2.1 Flux and regeneration", "The permeate flux was assessed throughout the process (400 min), returning the permeate stream to the feed tank. After 250 min of operation, the process was stopped, and the membrane regeneration protocol described above was applied, then the filtration pr ocess was returned for a further 150 min to assess the permeate flux recovery. The results are shown in Figure 3-2.", "By the analysis of the permeate f luxes obtained during the filtration process of the membranes SR100 and NP030 (250 min), it was verified that the permeated flux, in the four pressures evaluated, was higher in the NP030. This can be explained by comparing the molecular weight cut -off of m embranes ( Table 3-1). As a reference, Mariam & Nghiem (2010) performed the NF process for the treatment of pre -treated leachate collected from Whytes Gully landfill (Australia) using commercial membranes NF270 a nd SR2. The authors also reported similar results.", "Figure 3-2 Monitoring of the permeate flux during the nanofiltration process with membranes SR100 (a) and NP030 (b), at 6, 7, 8, and 9 bar operational pressure.", "At the pressure of 6 bar, in the cross -flow rate of 120 L. h-1 (250 min operation), the permeate flux of the SR100 membrane ranged from 9.9 to 5.7 L m-2 h-1, whereas for the N P030 membrane, this value was 14.8 to 11.0 L m-2 h-1. At higher pressure (9 bar), the range of values was 15.3 - 10.6 L m-2 h-1 (SR100) and 19.4 -14.7 L m-2 h-1 (NP030). Nonetheless, the operating pressure of 8 bar was defined as the optimum operating condi tion because it had more stable permeate flow values during the filtration ( Figure 3-2) and due to the technical limitations of the bench module. At 8 bar s of pressure, permeate fluxes of the SR100 and NP030 decreased from 13 .9 L m-2 h-1 to 11 .1 L m-2 h-1 after 250 min of opera tion and from 17 .9 L m-2 h-1 to 15 .1 L m-2 h-1, respectively.", "It is observed that in the nanofiltration, the permeate flux, at constant pressure, decreases continuously. Sir et al. (2012) point out that the continuous decrease of the permeate flux along the leachate treatment by membrane may be associated with the adsorption of humic and fulvic acids on the surface of the membrane, which can cause fouling and lead to shallow permeate flux, making the process unfeasible. Jiang et al. (2017) state that organic fouling by humic acids is mainly due to hydrophobic interact ions between organic matters and membrane surface. From this point of view, due to the high content of recalcitrant substances, organic fouling plays a major role in membrane filtration of landfill leachate.", "By the analysis of the permeate fluxes obtained during the nanofiltration process was observed that the NP030 membrane is more susceptible to fouling. As mentioned above, the leachate treatment was tested with two polymeric commercial SR100 and NP030 membranes. The former has a hydrophilic surface and the latter has a hydrophobic surface. Fouling in membrane systems is closely related to membrane material ( ABUABDOU et al., 2020). According to Jiang et al. (2017), membranes with smooth and hydrophilic surfaces demonstrated less fouling tendency than thos e with rough and hydrophobic surfaces. Therefore, SR100 is expected to have the best anti - fouling performance.", "As shown in Figure 3-2, the membrane cleaning protocol applied in this evaluation was able to recover, for both membranes, approximately 80% of the permeate flux. After regeneration of the membranes and 150 min of operation, the drop in permeate flux values was about 25%. Zirehpour & Rahimpour (2016) point out that NF and RO membranes have to be, once a week, cleaned with special cleaning agents, and in this case, their service lives could be estimated at 1.5 years. Since a variety of contaminants of the leachate, the membrane cleaning is a complex subject, indicating the characteristics of the contaminated sediment membrane, for the selection of the most economical and effective cleaning agents and cleaning solution is essential ( GUO et al., 2012).", "3.3.2.2 Effluent treatment", "The concentration of HS was considerably reduced, and their final value corresponded to a reduction of 90% and 87% of the level present in the pre -treated leachate, given the filtration process with membranes SR100 and NP030, respectively. Regarding COD, t he concentration was reduced from 2258±230 mg L-1 in the pre - treated effluent to 193±20 mg L-1 (SR100) and 225±20 mg L-1 (NP030) in the permeate. The COD values decreased to below 250 m L-1 established by local legislation as wastewater discharge standard .", "The results of the physicochemical analysis are summarized in Table 3-3. NF was very effective at removing all pollutants. The reduction rate of UV 254 was greater than 75%. BOD 5 was eliminated by more than 98%, while over 90% of true color was reduced. The turbidity was reduced from 39±4 NTU to 0.40±0.05 NTU in the permeate, which corresponds to 99% of removal.", "Comparatively, with the NF270 and SR2 membranes, Mariam and Nghiem (2010) obtained a reduction percentage of organic matter (reported as total organic carbon, TOC) ranging from 89 to 93%. In their study, the decline in permeate flux ranged from 14 to 60%. Similarly, organic fouling was the key factor for the decline in permeate stream. In our previous research, we obtained 89% TOC removal and 30% permeate flux decline (DE ALMEIDA et al., 2019).", "Table 3-3 Physicochemical parameters of pre -treated leachate and effluent after the application of the nanofiltration. Pre-treated leachate Nanofiltration Parameters Number of samples Min Max Average±SD Number of samples Min Max Average±SD Min Max Average±SD SD: Standard Deviation.", "In the current study, additional removals of Cl- (>45%) and conductivity (>35%) were obtained. A similar result was achieved by De Almeida et al. (2019) with nanofiltration membrane SB90 (molecular weight cut -off range, 500 - 700 D a). Claudhari & Murthy (2010) observed 62 and 65% rejection of chloride from two leachate samples with NF. On the other hand, the maximum chloride rejection was 14% in a study performed by Trebouet et al. (2001). As also reported by some other studies ( DE ALMEIDA et al., 2019; SAMHABER & NGUYEN , 2014 ), monovalent ions like Na+ and Cl-, which are present in sign ificant amounts in landfill leachates, can permeate an NF membrane. Baker (2012) points out that chloride is a monovalent anion, and the rejection of this type of ion is not characteristic of the NF membrane. However, its replacement can occur due to the p recipitation of Cl- in the membrane or even by the transport of ions, to maintain the membrane electroneutrality. In complex aqueous matrices, such as leachate, the presence of a wide variety of ions also presents a wide range of complex interactions, making it difficult to predict the efficient removal of monovalent contaminants.", "According to Claudhari & Murthy (2010), for Cl-, rejection is lower at acid pH values because the protons can neutralize the negative sites on the membrane surface, then chloride ions can pass easi ly through the membrane. Kim et al. (2006) evaluated the effect of pH on the rejection of inorganic salts using NF membrane and the rejection of Cl- increased with an increase in the feed pH. In the present study, possible the pH of the effluent (11.1±0.1) contributed to the rejection values obtained. In a more recent study, Amaral et al. (2015) obtained chloride and conductivity rejection above 80% in leachate treatment by NF, at feed pH 8.2±0.2.", "It is moreover noteworthy that the presence of HAs in leach ate was associated to the permeate flux decline and increase in the concentration of inorganic salts in the permeate during membrane filtration performed by Sir et al. (2012). The authors reported that the average rejection of inorganic salts decreased by 20% when 50 mg HA L-1 was added to the leachate. As mentioned above, changes in waste composition can have effects on leachate characteristics. In developed countries, as a result of the separation, recycling , and pretreatment of organic waste fractions, inorganic leachate parameters are more important, e.g., heavy metals, sulfide, chlorides, and salts. In this case, the replacement of the NF membranes by the reverse osmosis membranes is recommended.", "3.3.3 Cost est imation", "Regarding cost estimates for the process, the information obtained from the experimental units was used to assess leachate treatment costs. The CAPEX for a full - scale plant was estimated at MUS$ 0.772, and OPEX was found to be equal to US$ m-3. According to an estimate made by Samhaber & Nguyen (2014), the total cost of the industrial NF treatment process ranges from US$ 1 m-3 to US$ 6 m-3. However, few studies mention the use of NF to treat landfill leachate ( AMARAL et al., 2016; CHAUDHARI & MURTHY , 2010; DE ALMEIDA et al., 2019) and none of these texts have examined in detail the landfill leachate management costs . The costs for treatment of leachate vary from simpler processes such as co -treatment with sewage (about 18 - 27 € m-3) to more sophisticated technologies such as reverse osmos is (15 - 40 € m-3) (DE ALMEIDA et al., 2019).", "A sensibility analysis was performed to evaluate the impact of increased recovery on effluent treatment costs. For a recovery rate of 70%, there was a 5% decrease in OPEX per m3 of permeate. While in an 80% recovery scenario, these costs were reduced by about 17%. The increase in the recovery rate enables a decrease in operating cost per cubic meter of treated leachate. However, this increase in permeate recovery would result in an increase in polarization concentration at the membrane surface, resulting in severe risk of fouling and lower efficiency of removal of effluent pollution parameters. Figure 3-3 shows the relative composition, in percentage, of CAPEX and OPEX.", "Figure 3-3 Relative composition, in percentage, of (a) CAPEX and (b) OPEX.", "CAPEX has highlighted the expenses with the installed system, which account for the acquisition of peripherals. On the other hand, peripherals cost was related to the m2 of membrane used in the NF process . Also, membrane costs are proportional to plant size, which point out to an e conomy of scale.", "Regarding the OPEX, the percentage value related to the investment depreciation and membrane (exchange and cleaning) stands out, 42% and 22%, respectively. Operating expenses are incurred over the life of the project and include a variabl e component that can be managed continuously. Thus, it is evident that good operational practices throughout the useful life of the leachate treatment plant, such as periodic cleaning of membranes, may reduce operating costs and make the NF more economical ly attractive.", "The costs for managing the concentrate were not considered since it can be disposed of in the landfill without additional costs for the NF -plant. Opinions on the environmental and economic consequences of recirculation membrane concentrate practice are not unanimous, and specific studies present in the scientific literature are scarce. According to Talalaj (2015), this practice accelerated waste decomposition. On the other hand, Calabrò et al. (2018) reported that the frequency of specific parameters, e.g. ammoniacal nitrogen, Cl- and SO 4-2, was found to be higher in the leachate recovered after concentrate recirculation.", "3.4 CONCLUSIONS", "This study dealt with the application of NF on a bench -scale, followed by a cost estimative of the applied process in a full -scale NF plant. The conclusions from this work are:", "i. Due to the complexity of landfill leachate, to provide treated leachate that can be discharged into natural water streams or reused is not achievable using a single technique but a combination of different processes is required. NF can be used as the downstream stage of an integrated treatment in which the upstream treatment is covered by a physicochemical process.", "ii. The concentration of recalcitrant sub stances, expressed as HS, was reduced from 821±86 mg L-1 in the pre -treated leachate to 84±8 mg L-1 in the permeate, which corresponds to 90% rejection. The COD values decreased to below 250 m L-1 established by local legislation as disposal standard.", "iii. The CAPEX for a full -scale plant was estimated at MUS$ 0.772, and OPEX was found to be equal to US$ 3.35 m-3. The total cost to treat the effluent by NF was estimated at US$ 8.26 m-3.", "iv. Membrane fouling seems to be an inevitable problem of NF technology. In this respect, future researches should focus on novel membrane materials (e.g., nanomaterials, polymer/carbon nanotubes, nanocomposite, graphene), and membrane surface modification . v. Nanofiltration concentrate produced during the leachate treatment is a weakne ss of the membrane process and proper management is a challenging task. In addition, opinions about concentrate recirculation on landfill cells are conflicting and vary greatly between published studies. Therefore, further researches are needed and should focus on technologies for concentrate volume minimization or system configurations for reuse, treatment, and discharge. REFERENCES", "AMARAL M. C.

Leachate treatment process is expensive and different from each other due to the complex composition, also, its composition is variable from different landfills (TALALAJ et al. 2019). For this reason, the trea tment methods have not been standardized so far. In this context, landfill leachate management is one of the major environmental and economic issues faced by landfill owners.", "Reverse osmosis (RO) seems to be one of the most promising and efficient methods among existent processes for landfill leachate treatment used as the downstream stage of integrated treatment or integral treatment ( YAO , 2013) . Several studies have been using RO in the landfill leachate treatment ( CINGOLANI et al. 2018; DI MARIA et. 2018; DOLAR et al. 2016; SCHIOPU et al. 2012; TALALAJ et al. 2019). In the early 2010s, Šír et al. (2012) reported that RO -plants were installed in more than one hundred landf ill sites in northern Europe, North America, and the Far East. Besides, membrane filtration processes have been used at landfills in Brazil, for example, at the landfills of Seropédica, São Gonçalo, Gramacho and Campos in Rio de Janeiro State, Rio Claro an d Osasco in São Paulo State ( COSTA et al. 2019; DE ALMEIDA et al. 2019; DE ALMEIDA et al., 2020).", "The published literature reports studies that evaluated the technical feasibility of RO in the treatment of leachate. In general, the process performance in terms of removal of pollution parameters, e. g., COD, ammonia nitrogen, and chloride, were investigated ( KOŠUTIĆ et al. 2014; KUUSIK et al. 2014; TALALAJ 2015; ŠÍR et al. 2012; SMOL et al. 2015). This is due to the ability to retain contaminants dissolved in leachate with high efficiency. Cingolani et al. (2018) reported that RO can remove pollutants from leachate with an efficiency up to >99%. For this reason, it is preferred over ot her technological options. However, to the best of our knowledge, v ery few authors have examined in detail the landfill leachate management costs. Moreover, companies that run leachate treatment plants do not provide the actual process costs. Within this c ontext, the main objective of this work was to estimate the cost of landfill leachate treatment from a full -scale RO plant located in Rio de Janeiro State, Brazil.", "4.2 MATERIALS AND METHODS", "4.2.1 Case study", "The sanitary landfill of this study is located in Rio de Janeiro State, Brazil. It operates with the reception, treatment and final disposal of solid waste from non - hazardous industry activities, health services, different types of construction, and municipal solid waste. The inter -municipal sanitary landfill activities started in January 2012, with an initial construction investment of MUS$ 2.45. The capacity to receive solid waste is about 2,500 tons per day, and the estimated useful life is 15 years. Leachate treatment is estimated to continue to operate 20 years after the landfill closure. Even closure of sanitary landfills will not instantaneously eliminate the problem related to leachate because even capped, it will produce this wastewater stream (ALFAIA et al., 2017).", "The leachate treatment plant has be en operating since 2014, has a treatment capacity of 120 m3 day-1 and consists of a modular container -mounted system composed of the following process: sand filter, cartridge filters and, three -step RO (Figure 4-1).", "Figure 4-1 Leachate treatment plant set -up.

Weekly the membranes are alkaline washed (pH = 12), and monthly are subjected to citrus washing, both for 60 minutes. The reagents are added via pipelines and, pH is monitored on control room. The concentrate fr om the filtration process generated in stages -II and III returns to stage -I and, the brine produced is stored in two accumulation ponds and sent to three basins for concentrate storage of 10 m3 and recirculated to the landfill cells. Part of the permeate i s used as reuse water for humidification of access roads and landfill sites, and the remainder sent to leachate accumulation ponds.", "4.2.2 Cost estimation", "The cost estimation was represented by the capital expenses (CAPEX), by the operational expenses (OPEX) and by the specific treatment cost (STC) – total cost normalized per unit volume of treated leachate. For preliminary estimation of the expenses of full -scale RO, the following considerations were made: (i) the leachate treatment plant would operate 365 days a year and would be out of operation only during periods of routine maintenance, chemical cleaning and integrity testing (GUERRA & PELLEGRINO 2012); (ii) the RO process would operate with 71% recovery (R = 71%); (iii) The full -scale RO permeate flux (flow rate per unit membrane area, J = 10 L m-2 h-1) was based on manufacturer data (iv) the spiral membrane modules used would be 40 m2 in working area pe r module ( BAKER , 2012) and (v) final disposal of the concentrate generated in the process was not considered since this waste is disposed at landfill itself without additional costs for the leachate treatment plant.", "CAPEX was determined by adding the acquisition costs of (i) membrane modules and housings; (ii) valves, piping, pumps and instrumentation that constitute an RO -plant; (iii) construction costs; (iv) start -up; (v) indirect capital costs; and (vi) RO pre-treatment.", "i) Membranes and ho usings", "Membrane and housings acquisition costs are approximately 25 -35% of the total investment value ( SALEHI et al., 2014). The cost of membranes and housings was calculated from Equations 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, and 3.5 in chapter 3.", "ii) Peripherals and Pumps", "The estimated investment cost for peripherals in studies reported in the literature is approximately US$ 780 m-2 membrane, considering the purchase of valves, instruments, equipment, and piping ( SALEHI et al. 2014). The cost of RO pumps was estimated at U S$ 12,671.00 stage-1 (WESCHENFELDER et al. 2015) and corrected for information referenced in the Chemical Engineering Plant Cost Index to represent updated data for 2019. The correction factor for the pump cost was 1.48.", "iii) Construction costs", "The cost of construction was obtained, considerin g a percentage of 20% to the value of equipment and components ( MIERZWA et al. 2008).", "iv) Start -up", "The start -up cost is the amount of capital required to start the operation, corresponding to 8% of direct capital cost ( AMARAL et al. 2016).", "v) Indirect capital costs", "In addition to direct capital costs (directly related to the process and plant construction), there are also indirect costs, which correspond to the cost of land, team training, smaller -scale experiments, state permission to operate, among others. The value of CAPEX can be obtained by multiplying the direct investment cost (sum of capital costs) by the cost factor for indirect costs. For membrane separation process systems, the use of factor 1.67 is recommended (EPA, 2005).", "vi) RO pre -treatment", "According to Baker (2012), a reasonable pre -treatment system is essential to achieve a long RO membrane life. All RO units are fitted with a 0.45 μm cartridge filter followed by the high -pressure pump, and a sand filter ( BAKER , 2012). RO pre- treatment was estimated at 5% of the total RO system installation cost.", "For the composition of OPEX, the costs of energy consumption for RO operation, membrane exchange, workforce, membrane cleaning, depreciation, and maintenance were considered (SALEHI et al. 2014). Depreciation and maintenance costs incur independently of the operational status of the plant.", "According to Samhaber and Nguyen (2014), the OPEX of membrane processes can be attributed to the membrane replacement costs (MRC ) (Eq uation 4.1), which directly depend on the required membrane area and therefore, on the size of the plant that is used for the process. In wastewater treatment, the maximum affordable MRC is less than 10% of the equipment costs ( SAMHABER & NGUYEN 2014 ).", "Where, OPEX (US$ year-1); MRC (US$ year-1).", "4.2.2.3 Specific total cost (STC)", "The STC was obtained by Eq uation 4.2, which accounts for the OPEX normalized by the annual amount of treated effluent and the CAPEX normalized by volume of treated effluent added annually to the time, in years, of operation of the RO plant.", "𝑺𝑻𝑪 =(𝑪𝑨𝑷𝑬𝑿 +[𝒏×𝑶𝑷𝑬𝑿 ])", "Where, n: the operating period of the leachate treatment plant (years); Vt: total volume of treated effluent in the period (m3); CAPEX (US$); OPEX (US$ year-1).", "4.3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION", "For the operation of the leachate treatment system, given the considerations made in item 2.2, 405.75 m2 of membranes arranged in 11 filtration modules are required, as shown in Table 4-1.", "The case study full -scale RO of this work has 20 spiral membrane modules. Considering the data provided by the manufacturer for membrane model SC8040F1012 (LENNTECH, 2019), the case study leachate treatment system has 490 m2 of membrane area. However, it was not informed how many of these are kept in operation for leachate treatment.", "Table 4-1 Cost estimation parameters.

The membranes used are polymeric (polyamide). A gravel filter for the separation of coarse matter and a cartridge filter are arranged ups tream as RO pre -treatment. The treatment system contains 60 modules with about 460 m2 total membrane surface area; 44 of which are used in the leachate stage, 13 in the first concentrate stage and 3 in the second concentrate stage. The system treats 5 m3 of leachate per hour, and the permeate recovery is about 94% ( ZIREHPOUR & RAHIMPOUR , 2016).", "The CAPEX for a full -scale RO was estimated at MUS$ 1.413 ( Table S. 4 - 1), and specific total cost ranged from US$ 10.09 to US$ 8.58, full -scale RO with R = 71% based on the case study of this paper. Before the implementation of the RO system, the leachate treatment cost was estimated at US$ 21 m-3 (PMSG, 2014).", "According to Calabr ò et al. (2018), the overall treatment cost of landfill leachate (on-site) by RO in Italy is in the range of € 15 -40 m-3 (US$ 17 -44 m-3). Kurniawan & Chian (2006) point out that in German, subject to the complexity of the RO-plant, the landfill leachate treatment range s from 2 to US$ 30 m-3. On the other hand, Thörneby et al. (2003) conducted the treatment of stabilized leachate from the Hedekosga landfill (Sweden) using RO on a pilot -scale , and t he overall cost for a full -scale treatment was", "Figure 4-2 (a) shows that capital costs per volume of treated effluent decrease given more extended treatment plant operational time, with 71% recovery and MRC corresponding to 10% of equipment costs. M oreover, CAPEX has highlighted the expenses with indirect capital costs (60%) and peripherals and pumps (26%) ( Figure 4-2 (b)). On the other hand, it stands out that p eripherals' expenses are related to membrane costs. In this analysis, as can be seen, membranes and housings corresponded to 1% of capital costs.", "Figure 4-2 CAPEX and specific CAPEX as a function of operational time RO -plant in years (a) and, relative composition, in percentage, of CAPEX (b).", "Figure 4-3 shows a sensibili ty analysis performed to evaluate the impact of an increased % of the equipment costs attributed to MRC (Table S. 4 - 2).", "Figure 4-3 OPEX and specific OPEX as a function of the percentage of equipment costs considered in the MCR calculation.", "The OPEX for a full -unit RO ranged from MUS$ 0.132 to US$ 0.265. Also, it is observed that the operational expenses per cubic meter of treated effluent can be described as a first -degree equation (Specific OPEX = 0.6494 × “% of equipment costs” + 2.5978). Hence, the higher the value attributed to MRC, the higher the process OPEX will be. On the othe r hand, operational expenses are incurred over the life of the project and include a variable component that can be managed, for example, periodic cleaning of membranes, may reduce membrane replacement costs and make the RO more economically attractive.", "Besides high -performance membranes and appropriate operating conditions, the success of RO plants also depends on smart membrane element and process design to minimize adverse effects from concentration polarization and membrane fouling/biofouling, to meet the requirement of permeate as well as to reduce capital cost and energy consumption ( WANG & WANG , 2019). Particularly in relation to the operation of the RO -unit of this case study, biofouling was reported by the plant technicians as the biggest barrier t o the operation of the leachate treatment plant. In a literature review, Guo et al. (2012) state that biofouling of RO would be prevented by a combination of pre -treatment and periodic cleaning of membranes. Therefore, it becomes clear again that performin g preventive/curative process may extend membranes lifespan and reduce operational costs. A sensitivity analysis of RO recovery on STC was performed as shown in Figure 4-4.", "Figure 4-4 STC as a function of operational time of RO -plant considering different percentual of recovery.", "The STC of leachate treatment decreases with both increased plant operational time and RO system recovery ( Table S. 4 - 3). STC also has its reduced value given higher leachate feeding flowrate ( Table S. 4 - 4). However, the phenomena that occur on the membrane surface (fouling and polarization of concentration) will be even more intense when the quantities of contaminants increase. Nonetheless, in the case of leachate, this increase in membrane process recover y would result in an increase in polarization concentration at the membrane surface, resulting in severe risk of fouling and lower efficiency of removal of effluent pollution parameters ( DI MARIA et al., 2018; SCHIOPU et al., 2012 ).", "4.4 CONCLUSION S", "In this work, a procedure by retrieving data from the literature was proposed to estimate the treatment costs of a RO -plant. The CAPEX for a full -scale plant was estimated at MUS$ 1.413, and OPEX range from US$ 0.132 to US$ 0.265 m-3 per year. The literature reviewed shows that the cost of leachate treatment by RO range from 2 to US$ 44 m-3. In this case study, the cost of leachate treatment has been estimated at US$ 8.58 m-3 considering the operation of RO -unit for 20 years after landfill closure. The theoretical analysis was divided into a set of well -known equations for the cost estimation of RO -plant organized to estimate the cost of this case study leachate treatment, an a pproach not yet available in the literature. Also, the information presented and discussed contributes to the significant advance of the full -scale RO - plant. Furthermore, the procedure presented may be used as an auxiliary tool to estimate the cost of any membrane processes for wastewater treatment.", "REFERENCES", "AMARAL M. C. S. ; MORAVIA W.

In contrast, to close the loop of the landfill leachate treatment and find a final destination for the membrane concentrate (LLMC) ─ residual stream of the membrane filtration p rocess ─ is a critical issue, and LLMC management is a challenging task.", "Several technologies have been proposed and investigated to manage the membrane concentrate, including recirculation (CALABRÒ et al., 2010; CHAMEM et al., 2020; HE et al., 2015) , na tural evaporation (COSSU et al., 2018) , solidification/stabilization (S/S) (HUNCE et al., 2012) , chemical coagulation (LONG et al., 2017) , electrocoagulation (EC) (FERNANDES et al., 2019) , ozonation (SHAH et al., 2017) , advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) (e.g., Fenton, photo -Fenton, anodic oxidation) (FERNANDES et al., 2017; HONG et al., 2017; SOOMRO et al., 2020) , and thermal treatment (ZHANG et al., 2019) . The recirculation of the LLMC onto landfill waste cells is th e conventional approach, similar to leachate recycling to adjust moisture content and degrade organic pollutants in landfills (CALABRÒ & MANCINI , 2012; GROSSULE & LAVAGNOLO , 2020; S OHOO et al., 2019) . However, some critical issues like failures of landfill stability and accumulation of pollutants in the leachate treatment facility can emerge as negative impacts linked to this practice. Before the study carried out by (HENIGIN , 1995) , the consequences of the reinjection of concentrated leachates into the lan dfill body were under -discussed. In recent years, there has been an increasing amount of literature on the effects of this procedure (CALABRÒ et al., 2018; CHAMEM et al., 2020; MORELLO et al., 2016; TALALAJ , 2015; TALALAJ & BIEDKA , 2015) . Nonetheless, the published studies show contrasting conclusions. Therefore, further research in this area is still of high importance.", "Several other reviews already exist, which do excellent work in describing LFL treatment processes (ABUABDOU et al., 2020; COSTA et al., 2019; GAO et al., 2014; LUO et al., 2020; RENOU et al., 2008; WISZNIOWSKI et al., 2006) , membrane -based technologies fo r wastewater treatment (KAMALI et al., 2019) , and treatment technologies for membrane concentrate volume minimisation (JOO & TANSEL , 2015; SUBRAMANI & JACANGELO , 2014) . Readers are guided toward these contributions for further background information. Recen tly, Keyikoglu et al. (2021) reviewed the state -of-the-art of technologies for the treatment of LLMCs. Among existing methods, they paid more attention to AOPs. However, these techniques cannot effectively handle the high salinity of the LLMC and, therefor e, are mainly applied as a pretreatment step rather than a stand -alone treatment. Besides, AOPs are associated with high installation and operational expenses, and the possible generation of intermediates with higher toxicity during the LLMC treatment also represents a limitation for their consolidation on a full -scale application.", "As aforementioned, several approaches could be adopted for the management of LLMCs. Considering the demands of efficient water reuse, carbon, and nutrients from LLMCs or from LFL itself, efforts have been focused on extracting add -value products from conce ntrated leachates, e.g., inorganic salts and biofertilizers (GU et al., 2019; KURNIAWAN et al., 2021; LI et al., 2015) . At present, a review dealing with the management of LLMCs focusing on resource recovery has not been published yet .

These influence factors have been found in the analysis of nanofiltration concentrate (NFC) and reverse osmosis concentrate (ROC) from the LLTP in Xiamen (China), where concentrate s treams were collected from two different leachate treatment configurations. The NFC contained a high amount of refractory organics; conversely, recalcitrant contaminants in the ROC were lower because most of these were removed by pretreatment processes use d in the treatment chain (CHU et al., 2020) .

In addition, the BOD 5/COD ratios are in the range of 0.03 –0.40, indicating low biodegradability. The differences between LFL and LLMC, such as non -biodegradable content and organic matter composition, were investigated in three LLTPs. Humic substances (HSs), including humic ac id (HA) and fulvic acid (FA), accounted for the highest fraction of organic matter in LLMCs, ranging from 61.7 to 69.2% (ZHANG et al., 2013) . Chan et al.

These two approaches are critically discussed in the following items.", "5.3.2.1 Disposal", "The disposal of LLMC streams into the landfill body is the simplest and cheapest method. In general, LLMCs are accumulated in lagoons where physicochemical processes occur, and depending on climatic conditions; there is a moderate reduction of the concentr ate volume. Afterwards, the concentrate is injected onto the waste mass by vertical and/ or horizontal drains (CALABRÒ et al., 2018; ISWA, 2019; ROBINSON , 2005) . Before the work of (HENIGIN , 1995) , the consequences of concentrate injection were under -discu ssed. A body of scientific research was published in the last two decades. However, literature findings have revealed contrasting conclusions; therefore, this practice's sustainability is not a consensus.", "Robinson (2005) presented monitoring data of a German landfill that operated a RO system for one year, returning the concentrate to the landfill. The study showed that ROC infiltration increased COD, ammonia, and conductivity of the generated leachate, which immediately affected the RO performance. Similar results were found by (TALALAJ, 2015) and (TALALAJ & BIEDKA , 2015) . On the other hand, 15 -years monitoring data of an Italian landfill revealed a moderate change in leachate composition (slight increase in NH 4+, Cl-, and SO 4-2) and leachate quantity (i.e., leachate volume increased). However, RO treatment performance was not impacted (CALABRÒ et al., 2018) . In a previous study at the same Italian site, Calabrò et al.

However, it should be stated that the concentrate recirculation may be only a temporary solution resulting in never -ending re -introduction of pollution as concentrate contaminants may eventually accumulate in LLTPs.

However, coBE is time -consuming and requires energy input for aeration, increasing the footprint and operational costs. Recently, the authors proposed intermittent aeration as an energy -saving strategy and found that at a regime of 10 min on/20 min off, more than 50% of energy could be saved with similar treatability results (LIU et al., 2021) . Even thoug h the coBE process seems promising, more research is needed to optimise the technique and assess its techno -economic feasibility in large -scale applications.

The maximisation of high -quality water recovery during the LFL treatment through membrane processes can reduce the concentrate volume and guarantee high reclaimed water production (ISKANDER et al., 2017) . As mentioned early , several patented technologies to improve feed water recovery based on MLD and ZLD strategies is available. However, these systems are high capital and energy -intensive, which hampers their implementation in LLTPs. For example, Panagopoulos & Haralambous (2020) assessed two different scenarios considering the MLD and ZLD framework. The MLD scheme comprises membrane -based technologies, and the ZLD is membrane and thermal -based. At the freshwater recovery of 84.60% (MLD system) and 98.15% (ZLD system), the energy consumption of MLD and ZLD systems was estimated at 5.40 and 10.43 kWh m-3, respectively.", "On the other hand, multi -stage RO has proved to improve permeate recovery and reduce specific energy demand when less than five stages are used (JUDD , 2017) . Cingola ni et al. (2018) proposed a three -stage RO system (RO1, RO2, RO3) to maximise water recovery of LFL treatment and reach standards for water discharge or reuse. The water recovery was optimised to >90% following RO1 and RO2 stages, while the RO3 step was ne eded to achieve boron and nitrogen local requirements for reuse.", "Another approach beyond concentrate minimisation would be treating LLMC streams to accomplish minimal concentrate disposal producing high -quality water. In this regard, a microbial desalinat ion cell (MDC) was studied to treat the concentrated leachate from a forward osmosis (FO) system. The FO concentrate was desalinated in the MDC and the treated concentrate was returned to the FO for further water extraction. FO water recovery increased fro m 51.5% to 83.5% when operated along with the MDC system at the hydraulic retention time of 10 h (ISKANDER et al., 2018) .", "It should be highlighted that FO technology has received increased attention for water recovery due to its low energy requirements an d the low fouling propensity of FO membranes (LI et al., 2019) . The FO technology uses the osmotic pressure gradient to transport freshwater through the membrane. In this process, a draw solution (DS) with high salinity creates an osmotic pressure differen ce, leading water to flow from the feed effluent across the semipermeable FO membrane. Further separation of the diluted DS is required after the FO process to obtain reclaimed water as a product (SHAFFER et al., 2015) .", "CaCl 2, Ca(NO 3)2, NaCl, and thermolytic solutes based on ammonia and carbon dioxide, similar to NH 4HCO 3, are the most DS employed for FO applications (Achilli et al., 2010) . At the end of the FO filtration, the DS is recovered and recycled back to the FO unit while the permeate may n eed further treatment for its direct discharge or reuse (Wu et al., 2018) . The energy consumption of FO systems without DS regeneration is notably lower (0.2─0.9 vs. 10─14 kWh m-3) (VOUTCHKOV & KAISER , 2020) ; therefore, from an energy -efficient and resourc e recovery point of view, the selection of a fertilize draw solute for FO application can be an attractive strategy. Li et al. (2017) investigated a FO system using NH 4HCO 3 (3 mol L-1) as the DS to treat landfill leachate. FO recovery was higher than 90%, and the water product met the regulatory standards for agricultural fertigation. In another study, Qin et al. (2016) proposed to use the recovered NH 4HCO 3 (2 mol L-1) as DS in a hybrid -FO system for water recovery from landfill leachates.", "5.3.3.2 Humic substances", "As discussed in item 5.3.1 , LLMCs are rich in refractory organic compounds, mainly consisting of humic substances ─ high molecular weight compounds (300─10,000 Da) with phenolic, carboxylic, and alkoxy groups along wit h the occasional presence of esters and quinones (GU et al., 2019; LIMA et al., 2017; XU et al., 2017) . In agriculture, HSs are used as organic fertilizer and play a key role in improving soil proprieties (e.g., soil physical structure, nutrient retention, and water holding capacity), increase soil organic content and microbial diversity, and boost fertilizer efficiency. Due to its high salinity, the LLMC cannot be applied directly as an HS-containing liquid fertilizer (YE et al., 2019) . Thus, the enrichmen t and extraction of HSs from LLMCs have aroused strong interest .", "To date, the main methods for HS extraction from landfill leachates are chemical precipitation and membrane filtration. Chemical precipitation requires low pH (pH < 2), and therefore, the re covered product is not suitable for direct soil applications. Membrane processes have been used for the efficient extraction of HSs (GU et al., 2019) . Overall, UF and NF membranes with MWCO ranges of 200─1000 Da and 1─10 kDa are the primary techniques to f ractionate these compounds (XU et al., 2017; YE et al., 2020, 2019) . However, tight NF membranes can jeopardize the purification process for producing liquid fertilizer. The high salt rejection of NF membranes can result in excessive salts in the target product (i.e., concentrate stream) when the NF process is applied for desalination. On the other hand, UF membranes have wide pore sizes and enable almost unrestricted passage of inorganic salts, failing to efficiently fractionate salts and humic compounds due to inadequate rejection of substances of low molecular weight (3 00─3500 Da) such as fulvic acids (YE et al., 2019) .", "Xu et al. (2017) employed two -stage tight ultrafiltration (MWCO = 1000 Da) for extracting HSs from leachate concentrates. At the end of the concentration process, organic content was 45,370 mg HS L-1. With the addition of nutrient macroelements in the obtained liquour, the recovered stream could be used as liquid fertilizer. The authors estimated the economic benefit of the HS -containing soluble fertilizer production at 4672 USD m-3. This value could offs et production costs, including operating and purchase costs of macronutrients and generates an attractive margin profit.", "To efficient fractionating and desalting of NF concentrates, Ye et al. (2019) propose to use loose nanofiltration membrane with MWCO o f 860 Da, which takes the merits of both NF and UF membranes. At a concentration factor of 9.6, the HS content was enriched from 1765 to 15,287 mg L-1 with about 86% desalting efficiency. As a water -soluble fertilizer, the recovered liquour stimulated the seed germination and enhanced the growth of green mungbean plants, presenting no phytotoxicity. In recent work, the same research group proposed an integrated bio -inspired self -polymerisation procedure to tailor loose nanofiltration proprieties for efficie nt fractionation of HSs and desalination. Using the modified loose nanofiltration (298 Da), the LLMC was preconcentrated by a factor of 10.0 without permeate recirculation into the feed. Subsequently, a diafiltration step was performed to demineralize the pretreated LLMC. The bio -inspired membrane showed superior selectivity between HSs and inorganic salts. The concentration of HSs was enriched from 1779.4 to 17,247.1 mg L-1 and desalting efficiency of 99.5% was achieved, resulting in high HS purity (i.e., 98.3%) for potential liquid fertilizer applications (YE et al., 2020) .

An interesting work investigated the use of encapsulated HAs in alginate beds extracted from anaerobic sewage sludge to allow controlled and slow-release of humic substances in the soil. The agronomic tests showed that the dry biomass of the treated plants was remarkably higher than that for non -treated plants. The encapsulation of HAs within alginate beads could immobilize toxic compounds as well as reduce the amount of added product, ensuring a proper dose of HAs in the soil at lower operat ional costs (CRISTINA et al., 2020) .", "Following another recovery approach, the recalcitrant substances in LLMC streams could be reused for energetic p urposes . Ben Hassen -Trabelsi et al. (2020) investigated the co -pyrolysis of ROC and sewage sludge to recycle organics as biofuels. At optimum conditions (mixture of 30:70 ROC/sewage sludge, 550ºC, and 10ºC min-1 as heating rate), the process produced high -energy gas (12.29 MJ kg -1), which could be at least employed as an energy source for pyrolytic conversion. Thermochemical processes (e.g., torrefaction, pyrolysis, and gasification) seem to be an exciting strategy to produce value -added products from leachate concentrates, including biochar and bi o-oils.", "5.3.3.3 Nutrients", "Nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) are the major nutrients that are present in LFLs. As mentioned in section 2, ammoniacal nitrogen is one of the main landfill leachate pollutants and therefore most of LLTPs are designed to remove N. As contaminants, N and P stimulate excessive plant and algal growth, leading to waterbody eutrophication and associated adverse impacts. N -NH 3 removal of landfill leachates has been extensively studied (ANTWI et al., 2020; DE ALMEIDA et al., 2019; GENETHLIOU et al., 2021) . As resources, N and P are critical macronutrients for crops and hence are key components for fertilizer production. Besides, phosphate shortage linked to food security has intensified interest in P recovering of wastewaters. In NFC and ROC, the ammonia nitrogen concentration is generally high, reaching levels of 3273─8300 mg L-1 (Table 5-1); such levels are high enough to shift the focus from removal to recovery.", "Stripping technology and chemical precipitation are the main methods for nutrients recovery from wastewaters. Stripping technology is based on the ammonia gas-liquid equilibrium in an aqueous solution. In an alkaline enviro nment, usually pH from 10.5 to 11.5 at 25ºC, the balance of ammoniacal nitrogen in leachates tends to produce more ammonia than ammonium (NH 4+ (aq) + OH─(aq) ↔ NH 3(g)↑ + H 2O(l)) (CAMPOS et al., 2013) . Ammonia is a water -soluble gas. Thus, passing an air st ream through the wastewater, the ammonia concentration reaches the gas -liquid equilibrium in the system, and ammonia can be recovered from the stripped gas. The primary factors affecting ammonium stripping are pH, airflow, and temperature. High - temperature water vapour can be used as the air stream to boost the ammonia mass transfer. The stripping gas must be allocated into an acid solution for recovery purposes, so ammonia is recovered as an ammonium salt like NH 4Cl and (NH 4)2SO 4. The recovered salt can be reused in different industrial and commercial applications (CAMPOS et al., 2013; KURNIAWAN et al., 2021; XIANG et al., 2020) .", "However, full -scale applications of ammonia stripping may be costly, making nitrogen recovery from me mbrane concentrates unfeasible. Dos Santos et al. (2020) estimated the total cost of ammonia recovery from concentrated leachate at 51.64 USD m-3. This cost was mainly dependent on the price of the tower (in which the mass transfer occurs), chemicals for a bsorption, and electricity consumption (KURNIAWAN et al., 2021) . In each scenario, a detailed techno -economic evaluation should be performed, considering the process energy demand, system robustness, product quality, and local market demands.", "In the preci pitation method, nutrients are recovered via struvite precipitation. Struvite ( MgNH 4PO 4.6H2O) is a phosphate mineral and can be used as a slow -release fertilizer or raw material for the chemical industry. In struvite precipitation, an alkaline solution is obtained either by the addition of alkali solution or aeration stripping of carbon dioxide, followed by the introduction of magnesium salts for MgNH 4PO 4.6H2O formation, which has a 1:1:1 molar ratio of ammonium (NH 4+), phosphate (PO 4─3), and magnesium (Mg+2). When the concentrations of NH 4+, PO 4─3, and Mg+2 exceed their solubility limit, struvite formation recovers both N and P from leachates (LI et al., 2019) . The main drawback is that, in general, struvite precipitation requires external magnesium and phosphorus to promote struvite crystallization. As leachates contain less magnesium and phospha te ammonium, a large amount of chemicals may be required. Besides, P recovery is ideal at a pH higher than 9.5, requiring the addition of an alkaline solution (KURNIAWAN et al., 2021) .", "Moreover, struvite precipitation is susceptible to interference by hea vy metals and some inorganic ions like Ca+2, K+, Fe+3, and CO 3-, which also reduces the purity of the recovered mineral. Therefore, a compromise between process control and cost - effectiveness is needed to ensure the product quality and the process sustainability with more economic benefits (LI et al., 2019; XIANG et al., 2020) . According to (KURNIAWAN et al., 2021) , P recovery from waste streams is hardly carried out because the c ost of the recovered P is higher than that of natural rock -phosphate and the current technologies have a long cost recovery time of up to seven years .", "Recently, techniques such as microbial electrolysis, MD, and FO have been proposed for nutrients recover y of LFLs (QIN et al., 2016; XIE et al., 2016; ZICO et al., 2021) . Considering the demerits of each technology, the hybridisation of these processes with existing precipitation methods could benefit nutrients reclamation from waste streams. Hybrid systems could improve nutrient recovery efficiency and integrate differen t resource platforms, making nutrient recovery cost -effective and more attractive to be an option for valorisation of LLMC streams (XIE et al., 2016) .", "A submerged FO process linked to struvite precipitation was proposed to focus on both water and nutrient extraction. Three arrangements were tested to determine the optimal configuration about effects of struvite recovery on the FO performance : FO ─ calcium pretreatment ─ struvite precipitation (A1), calcium pretreatment ─ FO ─ struvite precipitation (A2), a nd calcium pretreatment ─ struvite precipitation ─ FO (A3). The A2 system was the optimum arrangement in terms of FO performance. Calcium pretreatment mitigated FO membrane fouling and improved the purity of the obtained struvite. The submerged FO system e fficiently recovered water from the leachate and reduced its volume by 37%. The recovered mineral in chemical precipitation had a similar crystal structure and composition to that of standard struvite. The proposed system recovered about 4.34 kg struvite a nd 366 kg of water per m3 of treated leachate in optimum conditions. The net profit was estimated at 0.80 USD m-3 (WU et al., 2018) .", "5.3.3.4 Inorganic salts", "NFC and ROC from LLTPs contain valuable inorganic ions such as Na+, K+, and Cl─, often located at levels higher than 890, 210, and 1280 mg L-1, respectively ( Table 5-1). Some of these inorganic species like potassium ions are scarce and therefore could exist a driv ing force behind their possible extraction. Other elements like chloride ions could be recovered as mixed salts or even transformed into high add -value products. Therefore, in this scenario, mineral reclamation of waste streams could make leachate treatmen t more sustainable and potentially economical (HUANG et al., 2020; LE DIRACH et al., 2005; LI et al., 2015) .", "At present, few published studies focus on mineral recovery from concentrated leachates. Most of the researches has investigated mineral extraction from sea -water brines. For example, Mohammadesmaeili et al. (2010) applied RO and isothermal evaporation to manage lima -soda pretreated concentrates from desalination plants. The proposed system recovered freshwater and produced mixed solid salt (i.e., Na2SO 4 and NaCl) with potential resale value. However, it should be noted that the current energy demand of the rmal-based technologies (7.7─72 kWh m-3) can hinder field applications (PANAGOPOULOS , 2021) . Therefore, more studies are still needed to evaluate the process economics considering the influence factors of each situation.", "A combined process composed of cat ion-exchange membrane electrolysis and chemical precipitation was developed to simultaneously treat NF concentrates and recover K+ and Cl─ ions as commercial by -products. The combined system exhibited excellent treatability results and allowed efficient recovery of gaseous chlorine and potassium -containing struvite. However, a preliminary economic analysis showed that the net profit of produ cts resale would not offset the system’s operating costs, which were most associated with the high electricity consumption of the electrochemical process (LI et al., 2015) .", "In another work, through a simple chemical precipitation method, antichlors of Bi(III) containing oxides with quantum dots (QDs) or two -dimensional (2D) structures were synthesized and then mixed with spinel ferrites (M -Fe3O4) and titanium dioxide (TiO 2) to combine with Bi 2O3 for magnetic recycling and photocatalysis improvement. The co nstructed antichlor was then used to treat concentrated leachates. Under optimum conditions, Cl─ removal efficiencies ranged from 60 to 90%. The treatment of concentrated leachates with the antichlors led to the formation of Bi -precipitates that contained coated BiOCl on the residual Bi 2O3/TiO 2 structure. This by -product was recovered and further used to treat the dechlorinated leachate. It was concluded that due to the excellent photocatalytic activity of the recovered material under UV─vis - near-infrared i rradiation, better than that of commercial BiOCl in the mineralisation of methyl orange, they could be used as a photocatalyst for the degradation of organic compounds of dechlorinated wastewaters (HUANG et al., 2020) . This research provides insights into chlorine removal techniques and the potential production of commercial photocatalytic materials. Further research in this field could help find alternatives for the valorisation of membrane concentrate and other chlorinated effluents.", "5.4 FUTURE PERSPECTIVES AND MANAGEMENT DIAGRAM FOR RESOURCE RECOVERY", "Environmental concerns and resources depletion is expected to accelerate greener and sustainable practices. Most of the literature findings are based on laboratory studies, showing that LLMC resour ce recovery systems are at the embryonic stage. At present, few technologies appear to be techno -economically applicable at a commercial scale, and some critical aspects (e.g., energy demand and process robustness) still need to be solved. Considering that future researches are required, we propose a recovery train to select the best recovery route. The proposed diagram can be helpful to define and test the overall performance of the selected recovery arrangement. In general, a sequential scheme for concent rate valorisation should include volume reduction with the recovery of clean water, followed by extraction of add -value materials. As discussed earlier, different types of LFLs and applied membrane treatment will result in different organic, salt, and nutr ient contents in the LLMC. Figure 5-2 shows the recovery train for implementing the best management route based on the main characteristics of LLMCs.", "The recovery scheme’s first step incorporates FO for water reclamation. The FO process appears the most promising technology for volume reduction and water recovery from membrane concentrates. As FO permeate stream is not clean water but a diluted DS, a r egeneration step is required. The Hybrid FO -RO process is more energy -efficient than standalone FO; therefore, coupling these processes helps save energy and reduce operational costs (SINGH et al., 2021) .", "Figure 5-2 General recovery train for the selection of resource recovery route.", "After volume reduction, a membrane -based process, i.e., tight UF or loose NF, can fractionate heavily organic streams, recovering HSs as liquid fertilizer . A desalting process should be employed if either FO concentrate stream or UF/NF permeate has high salinity. Thermal -based technologies like thermal evaporation and crystallization are the preferred systems for the valorisation of saline effluents (PANAGO POULOS , 2021) . However, high energy consumption and operational expenses can hamper its implementation in LLTPs. A renewable energy source such as biogas, commonly available in landfills, could produce energy input for desalting systems. Additionally, mixed salts (e.g. , NaCl, Na 2SO 4, CaCl 2, and MgCl 2) resale can generate net profit and make them more economically attractive.", "The tertiary step is optional if the quality of the concentrate stream is acceptable to be recycled back to the LLTP head or sent to the FO-RO system for further water recovery. On the other hand, high nutrient loads imply that instead of being moved back to the facility head, struvite could be precipitated out and sold as fertilizer. The treated effluent could then be recycled to the head of LLTP, reducing the effluent’s nutrient load. The proposed recovery train intends to recommend LLMC management based on resource recovery approaches rather than treatment and disposal.", "Recommended technologies in the diagram are not limited to those desc ribed here. For example, emerging resource recovery systems have been tested in laboratory studies, and further research on pilot -scale is expected for its implications and economic feasibility. Bioelectrochemical systems (BESs) have grabbed attention for simultaneous nutrient reclamation and energy production from leachates (ISKANDER et al., 2018; QIN et al., 2016) . Iskander et al. (2017) demonstrated that a BES producing 0.123 kWh m-3 could treat LFLs. Hybrid processes involving BESs coupled to FO might be promising to recover both water and chemicals, improving FO efficiency with less energy consumption. Low -cost phytoremediation systems can be implemented as a polishing step for nutrients and heavy met als removal depending on the concentrate composition. Harvested biomasses are useful for bioenergy production (biogas, biofuels, combustion for energy recuperation and heating) (GOMES , 2012; WIJEKOON et al., 2021) . Thus, energy recovery can further improve the proposed system's overall economic and commercial viability.", "The following aspects are recommended during the assessment of the defined resource recovery framework: 1) Material balance aiming to describe the resource recovery route in a quantitative way before its implementation; 2) detailed analysis of product quality, applicability, and local market demand for the recovered material; and 3) evaluation of potential impacts of the management route through a life cycle analysis perspective.", "5.5 CONCLUSIO NS", "The state -of-the-art of current research about membrane concentrates from LLTPs was critically examined in this article. Although LLMC recycling into the landfill body is the convenient management option, a more sustainable strategy is recommended. A general recovery train for implementing the best LLMC recovery route was proposed within this context. Low energy demand and membrane fouling propensity have made FO indispensable for volume reduction and water reclamation of concentrate str eams. Material extraction (e.g., fertilizers and inorganic salts) from the FO treated effluent could generate net profit and increase the system’s economic feasibility. However, few technologies appear to be techno -economically applicable at a commercial s cale, and some critical aspects (e.g., energy requirements and process robustness) still need to be solved. Future studies should focus on developing novel integrated systems combining benefits of each recovering technology, scale -up, techno -economic evalu ation of recovering processes, and assessment based on a life cycle perspective (i.e., environmental impacts and carbon footprint). Besides, the extraction of non -conventional value -added products (e.g., catalysts and bio -fuels) via existing or novel techn ologies is a promising area for future investigations.", "REFERENCES", "ACHILLI, A.; CATH, T.

Concentrate samples collected from the full-scale leachate treatment facility identified in chapter 4 were used in the proposed assessment.", "A final version of this chapter will be submitted as a research article in a specialized journal.", "6.1 INTRODUCTION", "Landfill leachate (LFL) is an inherent consequence of waste disposal in landfills. Due to its pollution potential, this complex wastewater mus t be adequately treated before discharging into a receiving environment (RENOU et al., 2008) . Following the most restrictive standards for wastewater disposal over the years, advanced technologies have been added to several L FL treatment facilities. Among them, nanofiltration (NF) and reverse osmosis (RO) are used to achieve contaminants removal beyond conventional treatments and set the most stringent legislation standards (DE ALMEIDA et al., 2020) . In 2018, the treatment capacity of NF/R O treating landfill leachates was more than 60k m3 per day in China (CHEN et al., 2021) . In European countries, due to the change of leachate quality linked to the ban on the landfilling of organic waste , membrane systems are expected to continue to play a key role in the leachate treatment chain since conventional processes (e.g., biological processes ) are not suitable to handle methanogenic leachates (DI MARIA et al., 2018; WARWICK et al., 2018) .", "On the other hand, a heavily contaminated stream named leachate concentrate is produced during the membrane technology operation. Concentrate streams account for up to 30% of the incoming leachate (WANG et al., 2017) . Landfill leachate membrane concentrate (LLMC) streams have high organic and salt content (total organic carbon (TOC): 2365─4500 mg L-1, total dissolved solids (TDS):", "18,910─66,900 mg L-1) (KEYIKOGLU et al., 2021) . Besides, a significant concentration of heavy metals and micropolluta nts not detected in the fresh leachate can also be found due to the membrane concentration effect (KEYIKOGLU et al., 2021; LI & LIU , 2021; WANG et al., 2016) . Therefore, LLMC management is a crucial aspect to be considered to close the leachate treatment c ycle .", "Due to its convenience and simplicity, LLMC recirculation onto the landfill body is a commonly adopted management tactic (ISWA, 2019) . However, the negative experience of concentrate recirculation in some sites started to grow the debate about its long-term sustainability. In the last decade, scientific interest emerged, and some important studies have been published. 15-year monitoring data of an Italian landfill revealed a moderate change in leachate composition (slight increase in NH 4+─N, Cl─, and SO 4─2) and leachate quantity. However, RO treatment performance was not impacted (CALABRÒ et al., 2018) . In a previous study at the same Italian site, the author s observed a moderate rise in organic matter content and heavy metals (i.e., Ni and Zn). Ho wever, no significant change in LFL quantity was identified in this case (CALABRÒ et al., 2010) .", "Other research efforts were conducted to elucidate the impacts of LLMC infiltration. TALALAJ & BIEDKA (2015) assessed the infiltration of 375 m3 per month of RO concentrate in a Polish landfill. An increase in mean values of sulphate, conductivity, ammonia, and chemical oxygen demand was reported after eight months of monitoring. DZOLEV & VUJIC (2016) observed a similar increase in leachate conductivity during 83 days of monitoring in a landfill in Bosnia -Herzegovina . In another work, WANG et al. (2017) simulated landfill cells filled with 1, 5, and 15 -yr age waste to analyse the infiltration process in a 24 -day experiment. The main findings indicated an increase in organics and ammonia in leachates from the one -year cells and a moderate increase in salinity and heavy metals in the five -year cells. Morello et al. (2016) evaluated the quantity and quality of leacha tes generated by lab -scale columns with membrane concentrate recirculation for 123 days. No consistent leachate quantity changes and organic content were noticed in this case.", "Despite the associated limitations of the studies above , that is, time of monitoring, scale, or no assessment of leachate treatment performance, it has been argued that concentrate recirculation sustainability is site -specific and depends on several factors associated with the landfill site and its operational conditions. The literature’s contrasting conclusions justify this management option, especially in emerging economies. For instance, in Rio de Janeiro State (Brazil), law number #9055/2020 permits the return to the landfill body of up to 1/3 of the leachate treatment byprod ucts, including sludge, biomass in excess , and membrane concentrate. To the best of our knowledge, LLMC reinjection has been adopted in other Brazilian landfills, where membrane systems are used in the leachate treatment chain.", "Adopting such a practice wi thout fully understanding its consequences can lead to unprecedented impacts in the LFL treatment chain and limit the development of greener management strategies . Within this context, the current study extended and complemented previous work by assessing the impacts of RO concentrate infiltration using simulated landfill cells in a 420 -day experiment. The specific objectives are as follows: 1) compare the leachate quantity in the two operation modes, that is, with and without concentrate infiltration, 2) a nalyse the quality of the generated LFLs in terms of specific physicochemical parameters, and 3) evaluate RO treatment performance along the cells monitoring experiment.", "6.2 MATERIALS AND METHODS", "6.2.1 Research program me", "Six experimental landfill cells were constructed and operated in different modes, i.e., without and with RO concentrate infiltration.

Even though our analysis provides a start -point to reflect on the impacts of concentrate recirculation on the leachate production in landfills that use such practice, this result should be carefully interpreted since from a 219 -day experiment, the leachate production of C i cells was diminished. The invariability of wastewater generation happened after a workin g incident. Consequently, the cells were rebuilt, and from there on, leachate generation was not uniform among C 0 and Ci cells. We hypothesized that short -circuits of the percolation ways and/or blockage by incrustation inside the cells were responsible for hampering the leachate draining. An autopsy of experimental cells may be helpful to elucidate such behaviour in future investigations.", "Concerning leachate production in landfills that operate at membrane concentrate recirculation mode, co ntrasting conclusions are reported in the literature. Data from 123 -day monitoring performed by Morello et al. (2016) showed that RO concentrate infiltration in simulated cells did not change the leachate quantity. In another work, Calabrò et al. (2010) as sessed the concentrate reinjection practice in an Italian landfill. The results from this 30 -month experiment showed that infiltration practice did not change the leachate produced in the full -scale landfill. Later, the same research group published a 10 -year monitoring assessment with a different conclusion.", "The pollution parameters analysis revealed that no significant change in pH, NH 3─N, conductivity, and TDS values was observed after 254-days of monitoring. In contrast, RO concentrate infiltration altered the leachate's organic content reported as COD and UV 254. The latter parameter is related to the aromatic content of organic substances ( LIMA et al., 2017). Higher COD amount after c oncentrate recirculation was also reported in leachates analysed by Robinson (2005), Calabrò et al. (2010), and Talalaj & Biedka (2015). This phenomenon could be associated with the high organic input from the concentrate recirculation process. Since the UV 254 parameter showed an increasing trend, microorganisms could be unable to degrade complex organic carbon leading to the accumulation of organic matter in the drained leachate. BOD 5/COD ratio values at the later stage of landfill cells (0.07 – 0.09) show that the leachate biodegradability is low. Therefore, anaerobic digestion inside the landfill site is hampered due to the recalcitrant content of organic matter. Besides, considering the high toxicity of injected concentrate (i.e., TUa > 500), biolog ical inhibition effects could also play a key role in this process.", "On the other hand, Robinson (2005) and Talalaj & Biedka (2015) observed an increase in leachate's ammonia and conductivity in their analysis. However, it must be noted that these authors performed no statistical assessment . In the present study, although both Ci median values were higher than those for leachate from C0 group (2675 vs 2432 mg L-1 and 19.72 v s 18.50 mS cm-1), they were not statistically significant. Similar analysis occurred for TDS (37.5 vs. 30.0 g L-1, p-valor > 0.05). One of the first study on this topic hypothesized that inorganic chemical reactions (e.g., precipitation and crystallization) cause the fixation of salts onto the landfilled waste , which can explain such results (HENIGIN , 1995) .", "Sulphate was detected in a higher quantity in leachates from Ci cells than that in C 0 group. This result can be justified by the high quantity of SO 4-2 ions in RO concentrate injected into landfill cells. We collected the RO concentrate from a full - scale facility that employs sulfuric acid in leachate pretreatment steps, which contributes to the high sulphate dose found in the concentrate ( 4567─8150 mg L -1, Table 1 ). Besides, sulfides can form precipitates with Ni, Pb, and Cu. The literature shows that in a landfill environment, heavy metals precipitate as sulfides and carbonates. Precipitates are fixed by adsorption onto the landfill waste , which often justifies the low concentration of heavy metals in the municipal solid waste leachate (KJELDSEN et al., 2002) .", "Finally, it is worth mentioning that other parameters , including dissolved organic carbon, turbidity, true colour, and ecotoxicity assays using Vibrio fis cheri bacteria were performed, but not analysed yet. Data will be included in future examinations to expand this work’s contribution.", "6.4.2 Treatment of LFLs", "The median of permeate fluxes was higher for leachate treatment from C 0 than that from the Ci group in all analysed campaigns. Values ranged from 0.9415 – 0.1415 and 0.2516 – 0.0472 L m-2 h-1 for C 0 and Ci in campaign 1, respectively. A similar trend was r ecorded during the treatment of leachates from campaign 2 . However, the statistical analysis showed no significant difference between the groups. In contrast, permeate results were statistically significant for the leachate collected from a long - term monit oring period . The permeate flux was up to 858 -fold higher treating the methanogenic leachate from the control group. This result is explained by comparing the membrane fouling resistances. Median values from infiltration and control groups were 0.0906 and 2.11 m-1 during the treatment of leachates, respectively. Given the increase in leachate organic matter, it can be inferred that organic fouling plays a major role during the treatment of leachate samples from Ci landfill cells. Overall, our findings suggest that the concentrate infiltration condition impacts th e leachate treatment performance by RO. Our analysis is following Robinson (2005) , who evaluated data from a German full -scale landfill in a 12-month monitoring experiment , concluding that the change in leachate composition affected the RO performance. Acc ording to the author, the landfill managers operated the membrane system for one year, after which it was removed from the site and replaced by a biological treatment system.", "6.5 CONCLUSIONS", "The present work assessed the impacts of concentrate infiltration practice on leachate quantity, quality, and RO treatment performance using simulated landfill cells. Major findings showed no significant change in pH, ammonia nitrogen , conductivity, and TDS after 254-day monitoring. In contrast, concentrate infiltration increased the leachate's organic content reported as COD and UV 254. Biochemical degradation inside the landfill cells was insufficient to reduce the organic load, specifically recalcitrant substances, leading to their accumulation in leachate solution. High organic content in Ci group’s leachates greatly impacted RO treatment performance. Fouling resistance was 6 -fold higher when the RO system was used to treat the methanogenic leachates generated by cells operating at concentrate infiltration mode. This result may be linked to higher operational expenses to clean and replace membrane modules at the full -scale facility.", "REFERENCES ASSOCIAÇÃO BRASILEIRA DE NORMAS TÉCNICAS (ABNT) : Resíduos sólidos – Classificação .

Pyrolysis of Spent Coffee Ground Using Landfill Leachate Concentrate as a Pyrolytic Additive", "This chapter focuses on the slow pyrolysis of spent coffee grounds using leachate concentrate residue as a pyrolytic additive. Biochars were characterized in terms of physicochemical parameters, morphology, and elemental composition to discuss pot ential agronomic and environmental benefits. Based on the ideas presented in chapter 5, th e present chapter aims to provide insights into alternative approaches for managing membrane concentrate streams within a circular bioeconomy context.", "This research was conducted at Università degli Studi di Padova from november/2021 to April/2022 under supervision of Professors Maria Cristina Lavagnolo, Roberta Bertani, and Paolo Sgarbossa. The research work was continued at Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro .", "A final version of this chapter will be submitted as a research article in a specialized journal.", "7.1 INTRODUCTION", "Membrane systems remove organic and inorganic compounds and provide high-level of leachate purification (DE ALMEIDA et al., 2020; DE ALMEIDA et al., 2020) . However, closing the leachate treatment loop and finding a final destination for the landfill leachate membrane concentrate (LLMC) ─ residual stream of membrane systems – is challenging (KEYIKOGLU et al., 2021) . Generally, L LMCs are high -saline streams ( 16,130 –98,000 μS cm-1) and , depending on the leachate composition and its treatment layout, refractory organic pollutants such as lignins -like, lipids/proteins -like and unsaturated hydrocarbons are presented on it in high -level (XIANG et al., 2022) . LLMC r ecirculation onto the landfill body is typical, but contaminants can accumulate in the leachate, making this approach critical. Indeed, this practice is prohibited in developed nations like Germany (MEIER et al., 2021) . On the other hand, treatment techniq ues (e.g., coagulation -flocculation, adsorption, ozonation, and incineration) can be costly and/or ineffective in handling highly polluted streams (CHEN et al., 2019; HONG et al., 2017; LONG et al., 2017; TOW et al., 2021) .", "Considering the current global resource depletion and climate change scenario, material extraction and carbon sequestration strategies are increasingly in demand (HUANG et al., 2020; KURNIAWAN et al., 2021; LI & LIU , 2021) . Pyrolysis (Py) has emerged as an option for valorisation and sustainable management of different kinds of biomasses (e.g., sewage sludge, agroindustrial residues, and urban/industrial wastes) (MANYÀ et al., 2018; PELLERA et al., 2021; SEO et al., 2022) and, therefore, could play a key role in this sense. Py is defined as the thermochemical decomposition of carbon -based feedstock in an absence/low oxygen environment at a temperature >400ºC. Solid carbonaceous material named biochar (BC) and py -gasses, including volatile organic substances, which can be condensed to liquid phase (bio -oil), and mixed non -condensable gasses (CO, CO 2, CH 4, and H 2) (syngas) are produced in this process (TRIPATHI et al., 2016) . Py -technology can be categorised as fast, intermediate, and slow depending on heating rate, peak temperature, and residence time. Slow pyrolysis is the most employed method for BC production because it offers the highest recovery of solid carbonaceous product (MANYÀ , 2012) . Due to its physicochemical proprieties (e.g., porous structure and water reten tion capacity), BC can be used as a soil amendment for agronomic benefits. Besides, soil application of this stable carbon -rich material can imply a net carbon removal from the atmosphere since the organic waste conversion to long -term stabilized soil carb on acts as a C -sink.", "Recently, co-pyrolysis of LLMC and sewage sludge for recovery of liquid and gas products was tested as an advanced technology for recycling organics in biofuels, which could be exported and/or used as an energy source for the thermoch emical process itself (HASSEN -TRABELSI et al., 2020) . In this sense, we attempted to expand the use of Py -technology , focusing on biochar production using RO leachate concentrate (ca. 5 g L-1 of total organic carbon ). However, our preliminary findings show ed that obtained pyrolysed material had low porosity and was mainly composed of salts (e.g., Na+, K+, and Cl-) arranged in clusters with irregular shapes. By examining SEM/EDS for its chemical elemental composition, the C/O ratio was lower than 0.01 in all investigated pyrolitic temperatures ( see supporting content of this chapter). Therefore, applying leachate concentrate in mono -Py may not be the most sustainable way to recycle organics as biochars. On the other hand, literature shows that inorganic compounds can play catalytic effects in the pyrolytic reaction of biomasses, increasing char yield and porosity of the produced carbonaceous material. In that direction, we hypothesized that leachate concentrate residues could be used as an additive to boost the yield and/or improve the quality of the BC produced in the thermochemical conversion of biomasses.", "This research focuses on the slow pyrolysis of spent coffee ground (SCG) using leachate concentrate residue as Py -additive. Biochars were characterized in terms of physicochemical parameters, morphology, and elemental composition to discuss potential agronomic and environmental benefits. SCG is a solid waste by -product from the coffee processing industry. It is usually landfilled, open -burned with other coffee residues and/or mixed with animal fodder. Therefore, the carbon footprint and environmental burdens associated with the existing management solutions are very concerning (MARTINEZ et al., 2021) . Thus, our study aims to provide ins ights into alternative approaches for managing solid wastes within a circular bioeconomy context .", "7.2 MATERIALS AND METHODS", "7.2.1 Research programme", "In order to investigate the pyrolytic conversion of SCG and LLMC, a synthetic leachate concentrate (SLC) was prepared and oven -dried. At a lab -scale pyrolizer under a nitrogen atmosphere, SCGs were treated at 600ºC for 1 h. Experimental conditions were defined based on preliminary Py -tests of oven -dried SLC samples and surveyed literature. Py -tests were conducted for SCG and SCG + oven -dried SLC (1:1 wt%). Proximate and ultimate analyses of biochars were performed.", "7.2.2 Biomass and additive", "The SLC was prepared following the procedure proposed by Grossule et al.", "(2022) (Table S.7 - 1). Hereafter, the sample was oven -dried at 105ºC for 24 h. The oven -dried SLC presented water content and VS/TS (volatile solids/ total solids) ratio of 2% and 51%, respectively. This residue was powdered and used in the subsequent pyrolytic tests. For practical applications, the LLMC could be evaporated using the heat from the Py -process. The SCG (100% Arabica ble nd) was provided by an Italian company. The sample was oven -dried overnight at 110ºC and stored in glass bottles.", "It should be noted that thermal technologies such as submerged combustion evaporation and mechanical vapour recompression have been used to h andle leachate concentrate streams (ZHANG et al., 2019) . In these systems, a dried residue is generated and commonly landfilled. Likewise, evaporation pounds used in warm regions for concentrate volume reduction generate sludges that must be properly manag ed (KEYIKOGLU et al., 2021) . In that way, this research could help expand the options to valorize waste streams from available options used to manage the LLMC.", "7.2.3 Py-process", "Slow pyrolysis experiments were conducted using a lab -scale pyrolizer at a heating rate of 45ºC min-1.

Below 500ºC , pyrolysis of biomass may produce biochar with low structural stability, while at temperature >800ºC the quantity of carbon left on char is minimum (AHMAD et al., 2014; PELLERA et al., 2021) .

Based on the Proximate analysis, this value was 10 -fold higher. Therefore, it was indicated that SLC’s alkali metals could catalyze the carbonization of organics in the biomass, producing a more porous ma terial able to retain more water. From elemental composition analysis, biochar from SCG+oven - dried SLC is C -rich and has essential soil minerals such as Na, K, Ca, and Mg.", "Chen et al . (2008) investigated the effects of eight inorganic additives, including NaOH, NaCl, Na 2CO 3, and Na 2SiO 3, which remarkably increased char yield and made Py-gasses give off earlier. In another work, Wang et al. (2006) showed that sodium compounds promote char formation and make pyrolysis more exothermic. To the best of my knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the effects of leachate concentrate on pyrolysis of an agroindustry residue. Thus, recent literature is not available for a reasoning comparative analysis.", "7.5 CONCLUSIONS", "This research focuse d on the slow p yrolysis of SCG using leachate concentrate as a pyroly tic additive. Our preliminary findings suggest that inorganic elements in leachate concentrate could catalyse the pyrolysis process of carbon substrates, increasing biochar porosity and its mineral content. In this sense, pyrolysis can play an essential role in membrane concentrate valorisation for producing a material that can be used as a C-sink and for mineral recycling. However, it must be highlighted that this investigation is at an embryonic stage. Even though it was suggested that co - pyrolysis of leachate concentrate and other substrates could be an exciting way to handle and valorise membrane concentrate s treams, our findings cannot be generalized. This research will include the C-balance of the pyrolysis process and phytotoxicity analysis of biochars. Most important, pyrolysis should be performed using actual leachate concentrate samples in future investig ations .", "REFERENCES", "AHMAD, M.; MOON, D.

In the landfill leachate treatment chain, membrane concentrate recirculation to the landfill body is commonly adopted as a management strategy. This study showed that concentrate infiltration increased the leachate's organic content, which impacted the RO performance during the treatment of methanogenic leachates. In contrast, for NH 3-N, conductivity, and TDS, insign ificant statistical differences were calculated between the leachate collected from cells that operated with and without concentrate infiltration. Taken t ogether, these findings suggest that organic fouling plays a critical role in membrane permeability de clining. In full -scale facilities, membrane fouling increases treatment operating expenses by demanding intensive cleaning and replacement of membrane modules.", "iii. Membrane concentrate infiltration did not impact the leachate quantity produced by the landfill cells. However, the generalisability of this result is subject to certain limitations.", "iv. Despite its limitations, the study certainly adds to our understanding of the impacts related to the leachate concentrate infiltration practice. If leachate concentrate reinjection into the landfill waste mass is adopted as a management strategy, proper engineering design must be done by monitoring site conditions, leachate quantity, quality , and treatment performance .", "v. Membrane concentrate streams o ffer water, energy, and material extraction opportunities, c onsidering the current global scenario of resource depletion and climate change. However, for commercial applications, several critical issues need to be addressed. In this sense, the pyrolytic pr ocess using leachate concentrate as an additive showed promising results, which can contribute to the development of greener management solutions.", "vi. Future studies should focus on the development of processes considering their techno -economic aspects. Their analyses based on a life cycle assessment and carbon footprint are recommended for possible full-scale implementation .", "APPENDIX", "Landfill Leachate Treatmento by Membrane -based Technologies: Cost -benefit Analysis, Membrane Concentrate Management, and Perspectives", "Appendix I.

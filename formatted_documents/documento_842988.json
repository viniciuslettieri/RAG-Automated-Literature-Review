In the ﬁrst part of the the- sis, a TDDFT study of the photoionization cross sections at the VUV region for the benzene, pyridine, furan, pyrrole, thiophene, phenol, naphthalene, and anthracene is presented, whereitisdemonstratedthattheTDDFTcrosssectionsexhibitedsimilar quality as the ones obtained with the CC approach but with much less computa- tionaltime. ThesecondpartdealswiththeNEXAFSphotoionizationspectraforthe water, ammonia, acetone, acetaldehyde, furan, and pyrrole obtained at the nitrogen, oxygen and carbon K-edges, at the TDDFT and CC levels. The K-shell excitations are treated as individual channels, separated from the valence part of the spectrum, in combination with a more sophisticated protocol to chose the interpolating points for the analytical continuation procedure. The NEXAFS photoionization methodol- ogy was further extended to the asymmetric-Lanczos based core-valence-separated CC approach for the water, ammonia, ethylene, carbon dioxide, acetaldehyde, fu- ran, and pyrrole to show that reliable photoabsorption cross sections, below and above the K-edge core ionization thresholds, can be obtained for larger molecules, using a core-valence-separated CC scheme based on the asymmetric Lanczos algo- rithm. In the third part, we propose an asymmetric-Lanczos based formulation of EOM-CCSD to compute excitation energies and transition strengths between ex- cited states. The methodology was used to compute the pseudo-spectra of selected vii valence excited-to-excited states in the systems helium, water, carbon monoxide, and sulfur dioxide and the results were compared with available experimental data and other theoretical calculations.",
        "Finally, a theoretical study of the photoionization and photoabsorption cross section spectra of the formic acid, HCOOH, and some its hydrogen-bonded small clusters, i.e., (HCOOH) 2, HCOOH+ 2, HCOHOH+, and HCOOH\u0001H3O+was also per- formed at the TDDFT level, in the X-ray region, and the results were used to discuss the role of the hydrogen-bonded clustering in the spectra considering the formic acid NEXAFS experiments under clustering conditions.",

All these publica- tions focused on the development of theoretical methodologies and new applications of the analytical continuation procedure to obtain nicely converged photoionization cross section spectra of valence, inner-shell and transient-excited states of atoms and molecules. However, besides the development of methods characteristic of this PhD thesis, it was also proposed a theoretical study of the photoionization and photoabsorption cross section spectra of the formic acid, HCOOH, and some its hydrogen-bonded small clusters, i.e., (HCOOH) 2, HCOOH+ 2, HCOHOH+, and HCOOH\u0001H3O+in the oxygen K-edge where the results were used to discuss the role of the hydrogen-bonded clustering in the spectra considering formic acid NEXAFS experiments under clustering conditions [4].",
        "The author ﬁrst work with the subject of photoionization cross section calcula- tion via the analytical continuation procedure was during his Master dissertation \"Cálculos de seção de choque de fotoionização e polarizabilidade dinâmica de sis- temas atômicos e moleculares utilizando funções de base Gaussianas\" [6] under the supervision of Prof. Alexandre Rocha and Prof. Marco A. C. Nascimento, which re- sulted in one publication in 2016 [7]. The methodology only available at that time to studies on the ultraviolet spectral region and to small systems (due to the computa- tional aspects of the Linear-Response Coupled-Cluster ansatz) was further extended in this thesis to larger molecular systems with the TDDFT approach, to the X-ray spectral region with TDDFT and with the core-valence-separated Coupled Cluster approximation, and to transient-excited states of molecules. Transient-excited state photoionization cross sections at the Coupled Cluster levels were obtained for the ﬁrst time in this work.",

Fragmentation of Valence and Carbon Core Excited and Ionized CH 2FCF 3Molecule. J. Phys. Part I Introduction The physical process in which atoms, molecules, clusters, or solids emit electrons upon irradiation is called photoionization [15]. It constitutes the foundation for photoelectron spectroscopy (PES), an experimental technique frequently used for the characterization of materials [16]. By recording the kinetic energy emitted by electrons, PES provides a portrait of the electronic structure of the system. It is helpful to consider the four photo-processes that are relevant in the vacuum ultra violet and soft X-ray ranges of interest. These are the following: •Photoabsorption •Inelastic and/or elastic scattering h\u0017+M!M\u0003+h\u00170and/orM+h\u0017 •Photoionization •Photofragmentation The probability of a given photo-process is usually measured in terms of cross sec- tions (\u001b), and it is generally expressed in units of megabarns (1 Mb = 10\u000018cm2). The cross section is also related to the diﬀerential oscillator strength df=dEby the expression The total photoabsorption cross section ( \u001bT abs) includes the four photo-processes listed above, that is, \u001bT abs=\u001bT neutral +\u001bT ionwhere\u001bT neutralaccounts for the ﬁrst two processes and \u001bT ionfor the two last. The total photoionization cross section ( \u001bT ion) relates with the total photoabsorption cross section through the so-called quantum yield,\u0000, given by \u0000 =Number of ionized molecules=s Number of absorbed photons=s(2) in which\u001bT ion= \u0000\u001bT abs. Of course, \u0000approaches unit as the ionization threshold is reached, and then, one may consider \u001bT ion\u0019\u001bT absabove the ionization threshold.",
        "For a deeper description and for the experimental aspects of photoabsorption cross section measurements, see the review by GALLAGHER et al.[17] entitled \" Absolute Cross Sections for Molecular Photoabsorption, Partial Photoionization, and Ionic Photofragmentation Processes \".",
        "Photoionization phenomena represent a vast research ﬁeld in which a wealth of information is extracted from related properties for molecules in gas or condensed phase as well as for adsorbed species. With the emerging of new experimental techniques, as well as the advent of the third generation of synchrotron radiation facilities, novel experimental measurements with increasing spectral resolution have been performed. The interpretation of photoionization cross-section spectra in the VUV (vacuum ultra violet) or in the X-ray absorption region provides valuable information about the electronic and vibrational structure of molecular systems. Particularly, Near edge X-ray absorption ﬁne structure (NEXAFS) is one impor- tant type of X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) with a large range of recent applications in diﬀerent systems like gas-phase peptides [18, 19], peptide in water [20, 21], peptide in a zwitterion structure [22], nitroxide free radicals [23], organic molecules on surfaces [24–27], fullerenes isomers [28–30], corroles compounds [31] and organic ﬁlms [16, 32, 33]. Another important application of XAS is in the study of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) molecules with astrochemistry implica- tions [34]. PAHs are abundant in the interstellar X-ray photon-rich environments [35,36]. Photo-stabilityofthisclassofmoleculesandtheirhydrogenatedderivatives, in X-ray region, can be understood by analyzing the inner-shell photoabsorption and photoionization cross sections [34, 36, 37].",
        "Also, novel coherent laser pulses and short-wavelength pulses light sources have been extended to the ultra violet (UV) and X-ray regions and can now be employed as the probing light in pump-probe spectroscopy experiments at the attosecond time scale [38–50], which asks for further improvements of the theoretical methods necessary to help in the interpretation of such experiments. While experimental measurements are rapidly becoming more sophisticated, the theoretical methods for photoionization processes are still lagging behind in spite of the fact that explicit electron wave functions of the continuum have been ob- tained within the Hartree-Fock (HF) approximation [51, 52] and X \u000blocal exchange potential [53] for example. Correlated ab initio methods based on quadratically integrable basis set ( a.k.a.L2) such as, for example, Multiconﬁgurational Self Con- sistent Field (MCSCF), algebraic diagramatic construction (ADC), coupled-cluster (CC), and time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) are generally used to interpret bound state properties, but their application in the description of pho- toionization phenomena still represents a considerable challenge. To overcome this diﬃculty, without relying on methods to obtain the explicit electron wave function in the continuum [51–54] and yet beneﬁt from the practicality of correlated ab initio L2based methods, implemented and optimized in a number of program packages, e.g., Turbomole [55], Dalton [56], we use a procedure of continuum discretization One of the main interests of the present study is the simulation of NEXAFS photoionization cross-section, which is very diﬃcult to converge since core-excited states lie in a manifold of high energy valence-excited states which makes their cal- culation a diﬃcult task. However, the well-known locality of these states makes the calculation ideal for local correlation treatments such as CC and TDDFT. More- over,L2based methods are largely used for simulating the discrete part of NEX- AFS spectra with the help of a simple approach consisting of taking the individual excitation and oscillator strength, each broadened by a Gaussian or a Lorentzian function. Despite of being very simple and appealing, this approach does not per- mit taking any information about the continuum region of the spectra due to the diﬀerent normalization of the “true” discrete states (below the IE) and the “true” continuum states describing the outgoing electron. The former are normalized to a Kronecker-\u000e(h mj ni=\u000emn), whilst the latter are normalized to a Dirac \u000e-function (h\u001e(E)j\u001e(E0)i=\u000eE\u0000E0). Accordingly, the continuum and discrete wavefunctions satisfy diﬀerent boundary conditions.",
        "Recently,severalmulticonﬁgurationalandmultireferencelevelshavebeenapplied to study discrete inner-shell states. Despite the accurate results, only small systems can be studied with these approaches [9, 58–65]. Core-electron excitation spectra have been also obtained with the Hartree-Fock (HF) [66, 67], the algebraic diagram- matic construction approaches ADC(2) and ADC(3) [68–71] and the ADC within the core-valence separation scheme (CVS-ADC) [72, 73]. Besides, EKSTRÖM et al. [74] obtained absorption cross-section with the random phase approximation (RPA) and density-functional based electronic structure methods directly from scanning the imaginary part of the complex dipole polarizability over the relevant frequency region. Other methodologies based on density functional theory can be found else- where [16, 32, 75–82]. X-ray spectroscopy studies based on coupled cluster ansatz have been conducted via equation-of-motion coupled cluster method (EOM-CC) by Nooijen and co-workers [83] and by Coriani and co-workers [84] with damped CC linear response (CC-LR) theory based on an asymmetric Lanczos-chain algorithm [85] which further extended the approach to a core-valence separation scheme (CVS- CC) [86, 87]. Despite these advances (concerning the discrete part), there is a vast demand for development of computational methods to for the continuum part of the NEXAFS spectra.",
        "In the seventies, Langhoﬀ and co-workers [88–90] had ﬁrst proposed a method for calculating cross-section of photoionization processes through a discretized rep- resentation of the continuum spectrum, obtained with a L2based method, em- ploying the technique known as Stieltjes imaging. In this technique, the principal pseudo-spectra of the Hamiltonian is extracted from the converged moments of the distribution of oscillator strengths, S(\u0000k) =Pr This technique was quite successful and is still used up to present days, with the discretized representation of the bound and continuum states obtained through the CC [91, 92], ADC [44, 93, 94], RPA and MCSCF wavefunctions [95–103]. How- Figure 1: Diagram of the protocol for obtaining the photoionization cross-section with the analyt- ical continuation procedure.",
        "ever, instead of following the Stieltjes protocol, we took a diﬀerent direction. Our method is inspired by the work of BROAD and REINHARDT [104], further devel- opedbyNASCIMENTOandGODDARD[105]andfollowedbyTENORIO et al.[7], where an approximate representation of the dynamic dipole polarizability function is constructed from a discrete representation of the bound and continuum states of the system. The dynamic dipole polarizability function is calculated at a number of points in the complex plane and subsequently, an analytical continuation pro- cedure, based on continued fraction functions, is employed to obtain an analytic representation for the complex dynamic dipole polarizability. The dynamic dipole polarizability function at complex frequencies (now represented by the converged continued fraction) is analytical in the complex plane with exception of an inﬁnite number of points on the real axis and a branch cut on the ﬁrst ionization threshold. With the representation of the complex dynamic dipole polarizability at hand, the photoionization cross-section can be directly obtained from its imaginary part, as well as the real dynamic dipole polarizability from its real part. The protocol is summarized in the diagram of Figure 1.",
        "Recently, we have applied the analytical continuation procedure to obtain the total photoionization and photodetachment cross-section in the VUV frequency re- gion for the atoms He and Ne, the molecules H 2, N2, CH 4, H2CO, C 2H2, CO 2, CO, H2O, NH 3and SO 2, and the anions H\u0000, F\u0000, OH\u0000and NH\u0000",
        "2by means of a Lanczos",
        "based implementation of the CCSD approach [7]. This work was next extended to the TDDFT framework [1] and applied for the benzene, pyridine, furan, pyrrole, thiophene, phenol, naphthalene, and anthracene where it was demonstrated that the TDDFT cross-section exhibited quality similar to the ones obtained with the CC approach but with much less computational time. Next, the NEXAFS pho- toionization spectra for water, ammonia, acetone, acetaldehyde, furan, and pyrrole were obtained at the nitrogen, oxygen and carbon K-edges at the TDDFT and CC levels [2] in which the K-shell excitations were treated as individual channels, separated from the valence part of the spectrum, combined with a more sophisti- cated protocol of choosing the interpolating points for the analytical continuation procedure. The NEXAFS photoionization methodology was further extended to the asymmetric-Lanczos based core-valence-separated CC approach [3] for the wa- ter, ammonia, ethylene, carbon dioxide, acetaldehyde, furan, and pyrrole molecules, where it was shown that reliable photoabsorption cross-section, below and above the K-edge core ionization thresholds, can be obtained for larger molecules, using a core-valence-separated CC scheme based on the asymmetric Lanczos algorithm. We have also proposed an asymmetric-Lanczos formulation of the EOM-CCSD approach to compute excitation energies and transition strengths between excited states [5]. The methodology was used to compute the pseudo-spectra of selected valenceexcited-to-excitedstatesinthesystemsHe,H 2O,COandSO 2andtheresults were compared with available experimental data and other theoretical calculations. Lastly, a theoretical study of the photoionization and photoabsorption cross- section spectra of the formic acid, HCOOH, and some its hydrogen-bonded small clusters, i.e., (HCOOH) 2, HCOOH+ 2, HCOHOH+, and HCOOH\u0001H3O+was per- formed at the TDDFT level, in the X-ray region [4], and the results were used to discuss the role of the hydrogen-bonded clustering in the spectra considering formic acid NEXAFS experiments under clustering conditions. Shortly, this PhD thesis aimed at the development and application of compu- tational methodologies for molecular photoabsorption and photoionization spec- troscopy of atoms and molecules, in both the ground and excited states, over a broad frequency range going from VUV to X-ray (inner-shell) spectral regions. In the next subsections a brief survey of the continuum problem and the proper L2basis sets used to reproduce the continuum properties will be given.

        "For bound states the choice of the basis set is a well established issue although in many instances computer limitations might prevent the use of the most appropriate basis for a particular calculation. The most used basis functions in calculations involving bound states are the so-called (cartesian) Gaussian-type functions (GTF) deﬁned as [106] gijk(\u000b;r) =N\u000bxiyjzke\u0000\u000br2(1.1) whereN\u000bis a normalization factor, and the non-linear parameter \u000bcharacterizes each individual basis function. Note that if x+y+z= 0;1or2, then, the function is as,pordlike type, respectively.",
        "However, forcalculationsinvolvingcontinuumstates, thesituationisquitediﬀer- ent. Continuumwavefunctionsarediﬃculttoobtainduetoitsasymptoticboundary conditions characterized by a great number of nodes [51–54]. In 1989, KAUFMANN et al.[107] have proposed an universal Gaussian basis set for the calculation of Ry- dberg and Continuum states by pure L2methods, which is the most accepted and employed basis set by other research groups recently working with the subject of photoionizations cross sections via L2basis set calculations [44, 91, 94, 108]. The basic idea supporting that L2wave functions can still be used for the cal- culation of atomic and molecular photoionization cross-sections rests on fact that the wave function of the ground state j 0ihas nonzero amplitude only inside some limited region of space of the order of the atomic or molecular dimensions that we shall call “interaction region”. Thus, one can evaluate transition dipole moments between the ground state and a ﬁnal state, that is, h 0jrj fiusing the resolution of the identity in any L2basis spanning the interaction region, in particular, in the basis of the eigenfunctions of Hobtained by imposing L2boundary conditions, as long asj fireproduces the oscillations of a wave function of the continuum in a region near the interaction region.",
        "The method proposed by KAUFMANN et al.is based on the generation of optimized sequences of Gaussian exponents by maximizing the overlap with a series ofSlater-typefunctionscharacterisedbyaconstantexponentandavariableprincipal quantum number. In this way linear combination of Gaussian basis functions can be obtained which are ideally suited to imitate Laguerre-Slater functions. Instead of arbitrarily choosing Gaussian-type functions aimed to reproduce the continuum part of the spectrum, one must remember that there exist a complete orthonormal set of functions which spans the whole space of all discrete and con- tinuum solutions of a hydrogenic system [109], the Laguerre-Slater functions. The radial part of this function is deﬁned as whereL2l+2 n+l+1represents the associated Laguerre polynomial of degree n\u0000l\u00001. The scale factor \u0010is constant for all members of the set. It means that the optimiza- tion problem can be reduced to an approximation problem of Slater functions by Gaussians, like Huzinaga [110] did in the 1960’s.",
        "The central idea proposed by KAUFMANN et al.is to approximate one Slater- type function characterized by the quantum number nby one Gaussian function characterized by the exponent \u000b. The quantum number n, in Kauﬀmann’s pro- tocol, can be integer or half-integer, where ngenerates a sequence of exponents f\u000bigi=1;n. Accordingly, as the electron reaches the continuum, the quantum number nincreases up to inﬁnity. On the other hand, it is computationally unreal to use an inﬁnity number of GTF to represent the electron in the continuum, as n=1would generate a sequence of inﬁnity exponents f\u000bigi=1;1. Actually, for a generic atomic system, using a Kaufmann’s continuum-like set with a quantum number higher than 15 provokes linear dependence in the basis. Thus, one must test the convergence of the continuum property of interest for the lowest possible nquantum number, avoiding linear dependence in the basis set. Details about the mathematical pro- tocol for maximizing the overlap between Laguerre-Slater functions with GTF can be consulted in Ref. [107]. Here, a comparison between the radial part of analytic Laguerre-Slater functions, the set of optimized continuum-like GTF sets, and the explicit wave function of the continuum in a plane waves basis for the He atom is given in Figures 1.1 and 1.2. The continuum-like S and P functions were optimized self-consistently with the Dalton program [56].",

Slater functions and the optimized continuum-like set is very good showing that the Kaufmann’s protocol is fulﬁlling its purpose. Second, comparing the explicit wave function of the continuum with the continuum-like set (or Laguerre-Slater) functions one observes that the oscillations of the continuum wave function are reproduced up to 20 Bohr away from the nucleus, which is far enough to reproduce the photoionization cross-section of He up to 100 eV (see Fig. 3 in TENORIO et al. [7] for the He photoionization cross-section calculated with an equivalent basis set).

        "It is important to mention that an applied ﬁeld induces a dipole moment that might not be parallel to the ﬁeld. As a result, the dipole polarizability is a second- rank tensor but herein we worked with the averaged (diagonal) dipole polarizability only,i.e., From a quantum mechanical time-dependent perturbation theory treatment one obtains the averaged dynamic dipole polarizability as [114] with (df=d\" ) =P1 i=1fi\u000e(!i\u0000\") +g(!), and with !i,fiandg(!)representing the transition frequencies, bound and continuum oscillator strengths, respectively. This deﬁnition can be extended to complex values of frequency, leading to The dynamic dipole polarizability in complex values of frequencies, \u000b(z), is analyt- ical throughout the complex plane, except for an inﬁnite number of poles along the real axis, and a branch cut in the photoionization interval \"I\u0014Re(z)<1, where \"Iis the ﬁrst ionization threshold of the system.",
        "If we take the complex frequency as being close enough to the real axis by considering z= lim\u0011!0(!+i\u0011), the dynamic polarizability then takes the form (See Ref. [6] for a detailed derivation).",

Separating the real and the imaginary part in the lim\u0011!0\u000b(!+i\u0011) lim i=1fi lim and recalling that the cross section can be written as [114] we obtain straightaway the following relations clim A crucial point in this approach is to recognize the dynamic polarizability as a Stieltjes series [90]. A Stieltjes series can be written as with\u001fmbeing the moments of a given distribution, \u0012(u), where \u001fm=Z1 From the Stieltjes theory of moments, we know that a given distribution can be reconstructed once its moments are known [115]. We rewrite Eq. (1.9) changing the variable!2=\u0000y Its n-fold derivative is dn\u000b(y) Expanding \u000b(y)about the origin, we obtain where \u000bn=Z1 which can be also rewritten as \u000bn=1X i=1fi i+Z1 The dynamic polarizability is thus a Stieltjes series, where we recognize the terms \u000bnas the moments of the distribution of oscillator strengths, also called sum rules . Such observation enforces our need for a careful choice of the basis set which can reproduce the sum rules of the oscillator strengths in order to construct an reliable approximate representation of the dynamic polarizability. In the spirit of the work of Broad and Reinhardt [104], our methodology consists in approximating \u000b(z)by a ﬁnite sum \u000b(z) =kX i=1~fi where the pseudo spectrum f~!i;~figi=1;kstands for the approximate transition fre- quencies and oscillator strengths obtained in the L2basis-set calculation, which, in the present case, is the pseudo spectra obtained from the TDDFT [1, 2, 4] and Lanczos-based coupled cluster calculations [2, 3, 5]. We now turn our discussion back to the fact that the dynamic polarizability is a Stieltjes series. It is well known that, for a Stieltjes series, continued fractions, which are equivalent to a [N\u00001=N]Padé approximant, will converge, as Ngoes to inﬁnity, to the function \u000b(z)in the cut [115]. It was shown by Nascimento et al.that the convergence can be achieved with small values of N[105, 116, 117]. Observing that the dynamical polarizability is a Stieltjes series gives us a clue on how to perform the analytical continuation, and in this work we use a continued fraction procedure as described in Ref. 118. Having the (pseudo-)spectrum at hand, we construct the approximation for \u000b(z)as in Eq. (1.24) and calculate \u000b(z)at a number of points in the complex plane. These points are ﬁtted by the continued fractions procedure, providing a representation of \u000b(z)in the complex plane. Using this representation, from converged continued fraction, we calculate \u000b(z)on the real axis where it equals \u000b(!). The imaginary part of \u000b(z)on the real axis provides the cross section by Eq. (1.15).",

(1.24) converges to the function \u000b(z). Nevertheless, a “better” choice for the points can be found as the one described in the next section.",
        "The multipoint Padé approximants are ratios of two polynomials and can be obtained from a continued fraction function. The details of the algorithm are as follows [118]: given a number Nof points in the complex plane fzigi=1;::;N, we insert them in Eq. (1.24) which yields Napproximate values [\u000b(zi)\u0011\u000bi]i=1;:::;N.

The oscillator strengths are obtained according to Eq. 2.8. See Refs. [84] and [85] for further deﬁnitions and details. As the Lanczos algorithm is known to converge from the extremes, converged core excitation energies would require the use a very large number of chain vectors, in other words, a very large matrix T, which becomes quickly prohibitive even for medium size systems. One can overcome this limitation by taking advantage of the almost non-existent coupling between valence and core excited states, and set elements corresponding to such couplings to zero during the iterative construction of the Tmatrix with negligible loss of accuracy within the chosen approximate level of theory. Via the CVS scheme, [86, 126, 127] which is to be regarded as an eﬃcient procedure to remove the continuum sea of valence ionizations from the inner-shell excitation region, the Lanczos approach yields straightforwardly a pseudo-spectrum starting at the lowest dipole-allowed core excitation of the chosen edge. The CVS is easily introduced within the asymmetric Lanczos algorithm by ap- plying, at each iteration, the projector Pv Iba i= 0 ifi6=I; Pv Ibab to both the pT landqlvectors and their linear transformations pT lAandAql. The projector removes all vector elements not referencing at least one core orbital or a set of selected core orbitals I. In this way, the Lanczos trial-vector bases PTand Qonly contain excitations involving at least one core orbital, eﬀectively decoupling them from excitations with contributions from occupied valence orbitals only. Diag- onalization of the tridiagonal matrix yields the core excitations occurring as lowest roots, hereby quickly converging to the exact results with signiﬁcantly smaller Lanc- zos chain lengths, and the Lanczos eigenvectors only refer to core excitations. The oscillator strengths and cross sections are computed directly from them, without further modiﬁcations to the general procedure.",

[2, 3, 91, 92] Herein, we are interested in obtaining the total photoionization cross sections for a valence excited state. Speciﬁcally, we aim at generating the pseudo-spectrum from a chosen excited state employing an asymmetric Lanczos algorithm and with strengths corresponding to the EOM-CCSD ones given in Eq. (2.18). Our procedure for calculating the excited-state pseudo-spectrum within the EOM-CCSD framework can be summarized as follows:",
        "1. First, we calculate the initial excitation vectors ( RiandLi) via a regular Davidson diagonalization of Eq. (2.21) 2. Next, we select the Lanczos seeds and build the tridiagonal representation of the CC Jacobian Tsuch as to span the space of ﬁnal excited states ( j) that are dipole allowed from the initial state.",

We compute the oscillator strengths between the initial state state iand the ﬁnal states jfrom the Lanczos eigenvectors and eigenvalues of states j, and the Davidson eigenvectors and eigenvalue of state i. Crucial steps in our procedure are the proper choice of the initial Lanczos seeds in order to generate the pseudo-spectrum in the ﬁnal symmetry space (step (2)), and the computation of the EOM-CCSD transition strengths between excited states As Lanczos starting vectors, we use the following normalized q1andpT",

The seeds in Eq. (2.24) were deﬁned based on Eq. (2.18), where the last term was neglected since eventually it will not contribute because of the biorthogonality condition between excited states.

Herein, we present results obtained at other levels of coupled cluster theory and time-dependent density functional theory. The objective of this section is to establish a comparison among these approaches and particularly to check the performance of TDDFT under diﬀerent exchange- correlation functions in order to pave the way to the applications in the next sec- tions.",
        "In ﬁgure 3.1, we present the CCS, CC2 and CCSD, as well as TDDFT with PBE, PBE0 functionals and RPA total photoabsorption cross section of ammonia using aug-cc-pVQZ basis set for nitrogen and hydrogen atoms supplemented with the4s4p3d continuum-like basis set. Experimental results [135] are also shown for comparison. For the calculation using the Lanczos-based version of CC linear re- sponse theory[84, 85] the dimension of the Lanczos chain length has been truncated at the value of 300.[7] The calculations at the TDDFT and RPA levels were per- formed imposing C3vpoint group symmetry to obtain vertical excitations to 269 ( A1 A1) singlet transitions and 404 ( E A1) singlet transitions. The total photoabsorption cross section of ammonia presents two distinguished sharp and weak bands below the ﬁrst ionization threshold ( \u001810.1 eV[133]), at 6.2 eV and 9.3 eV and other nearly above at 11.7 eV.[135] The two bands below the ﬁrst ionization threshold are attributed to discrete transitions of valence electrons, whilst the one at 11.7 eV is assigned as an autoionization peak [136]. In Figure 3.1, we observe a large discrepancy between the experimental and the CCS values of the photoabsorption cross sections. On the other hand, the CC2 and CCSD results show a reasonable agreement with experiment. The time-dependent density functional theory results with functionals PBE and PBE0 show good agree- ment with experiment but it is worth mentioning that the PBE0 functional presents a slightly better performance than its GGA counterpart. The fact that PBE0 re- produces better the experimental spectrum than PBE is not surprising, since the inclusion of a Hartree Fock exchange term into the functional systematically im- proves the description of excited states[137, 138]. The TDDFT result with the PBE0 functional is also better than the RPA one.",
        "In Figure 3.2 we compare the cross sections obtained at the CCSD and TDDFT/PBE0 levels shown in Figure 3.1 with experimental results [135] . It is clear that CCSD performance in both the discrete region below the ﬁrst ioniza- tion threshold and the continuum region of the spectrum is superior to that of TDDFT/PBE0, but that the TDDFT result is still satisfactory. This comparison has encouraged us to apply TDDFT for other molecules as described in the next sections.",
        "Next we examined the photoabsorption cross section spectra dependence on the size of the basis sets, since an expensive basis set such as (d-)aug-cc-pVQZ, will not always be a convenient option for larger systems. Accordingly, we have per- formed calculations with d-aug-cc-pVTZ and aug-cc-pVTZ basis set and the results are presented in Figure 3.3. At the TDDFT/PBE0 calculation, 213 vertical excita- tions toA1states and 304 to Estates were obtained with d-aug-cc-pVTZ basis set complemented with the 4s4p3d continuum-like set, and 166 vertical excitations to A1states and 233 to Estates with aug-cc-pVTZ basis set complemented with the 4s4p3d continuum-like set.",
        "FromFigure3.3weobservethatboththed-aug-cc-pVTZandaug-cc-pVTZbasis sets furnish a satisfactory description of the continuum region of the spectrum, but for a good description of the discrete region, below the ﬁrst ionization threshold, the doubly augmented basis seems to be necessary. Comparing the eﬀect of the basis set on both levels of calculation, we observe from Figure 3.3, that the CCSD results are more sensitive to the basis than TDDFT/PBE0 in the discrete region of the spectrum.",

The sum rules are very basis set sensitive, thus, a careful choice is recommended.

Here we present the total cross section of benzene evaluated with our methodology at TDDFT level with PBE functional (Figure 3.4). Results making use of resolution of the identity technique (RI), in which the four-center two- electron integrals are approximated by corresponding three-center integrals[140], are also shown.",
        "In the previous section, for the ammonia molecule, we have shown that the hybrid functional PBE0 presents better results when compared to its GGA coun- terpart, PBE. Notwithstanding, our choice of the PBE functional to proceed with the studies is justiﬁed by the fact that in spite of being more accurate, calculations with the PBE0 functional are much more time consuming than with PBE when the RI technique is used. As the main objective of the present study is the investigation of photoionization cross-sections of medium/large sized molecules using TDDFT, it could be desirable to perform the calculations with a functional that provides reliable results at low computational cost. As will be clear from the next sections, results obtained with PBE functional are quite satisfactory for our purposes. Figure 3.4 shows the results for benzene obtained with our methodology at the TDDFT/PBE level of calculation using a d-aug-cc-pVTZ complemented with the 4s4p3d continuum-like basis. Vertical excitations, in D6hsymmetry, were obtained for 434 (A2u A1g) and 1000 ( E1u A1g) singlet states transitions.

Contributions of \u0019\u0003 \u0019(E1u A1g) singlet transitions are responsible for that feature of the spectrum, which is reproduced by our theoretical result as one can see from Figure 3.4. Above the ﬁrst ionization threshold an intense and broad peak with a maximum near 20 eV (154 Mb) is also reproduced by our methodology. At higher energies up to 100 eV, we note that the tail proﬁle of the experimental spectrum is perfectly matched by the theoretical curve. In general, good agreement with experiment[141] was obtained for both discrete and continuum regions of the spectrum, indicating that the cross sections obtained with TDDFT in conjunction withthe4s4p3d continuum-like setarequantitativeforboththeboundandunbound regions of the spectrum.",

        "The total photoabsorption cross section of pyridine presents a sharp and intense peak below the ﬁrst ionization threshold ( \u00189.26 eV), centered at 7.2 eV[142]. Our calculations indicate that such feature is due to a set of intense \u0019\u0003 \u0019(B1 A1) singlet transitions, which is conﬁrmed by other theoretical results[142]. As can be seen in the bottom panel of Figure 3.6, the experimental cross section presents two very weak peaks, one at 5 eV and other at 6.3 eV which can be associated to the theoretical narrow peaks at 4.2 eV ( B2 A1singlet transition) and 5.2 eV ( B1 A1singlet transition).",
        "The theoretical spectrum presented in Figure 3.6 shows an artiﬁcial intense and narrow peak above the ﬁrst ionization threshold centered at 10.5 eV.That region of the experimental[142] spectrum is rich of structures and it is possible that the TDDFT/PBE calculation overestimated some of them giving rise to a artiﬁcial nar- row peak at the region.",

Experimental data (red dots) have been taken from A broad and intense band above the ﬁrst ionization threshold centered at 20 eV (133 Mb) is observed in the experimental cross section. This same feature appears in the theoretical spectrum but centered around 18 eV and with an intensity (138 Mb) slightly above the experimental one (133 Mb). The maximum of the main theoretical band occurs at 138 Mb, which is slightly superior, by 5 Mb, to the ex- perimental maximum. Such diﬀerence between the theoretical and the experimental cross sections can be attributed to a deﬁciency of the functional and/or the used basis set to correctly reproduce the continuum region of pyridine spectrum. A larger basis set in conjunction with a hybrid functional, such as PBE0, could improve the theoretical results.",
        "It is know that PBE0 calculations are able to improve the excited states descrip- tion, but on the other hand, it is also know that PBE0 calculations are much more time consuming than its GGA counterpart, PBE. In that case, TDDFT calculations with PBE functional in conjunction with the RI technique (TDDFT-RI/PBE) is preferable, even more when one is dealing with a number of transitions states of the order of thousands, as in our case. In order to improve the theoretical cross sections but, without calculating thousands of electronic transitions at the PBE0 level, we have tried an approach, which we call mixed representation , where a small number of excited states, say one hundred, is obtained at the TDDFT/PBE0 level while the remaining ones are obtained at the computationally cheaper TDDFT-RI/PBE level. In Figure 3.7 we present the total photoabsorption cross section of pyridine obtained with the mixed representation . These results were obtained by taking the TDDFT-RI/PBE pseudo-spectrum of the Figure 3.6 calculation and replacing the ﬁrst 100 electronic transition states with the corresponding 100 ( A1 A1), (B1 A1) and (B2 A1) singlet transitions obtained at the TDDFT/PBE0 level. Com- paring the results of Figures 3.6 and 3.7, one observes a few improvements in the theoretical cross sections. First, the virtual narrow peak at 10.5 eV of Figure 3.6 is not present in Figure 3.7. Instead, in Figure 3.7 we observe a shoulder at the region extending from 10 to 15 eV, which represent the region of inner-valence transitions that is in excellent agreement with the experimental data. Secondly, as shown in Figure 3.7 (bottom panel) the very weak experimental peak at 5 eV is perfectly reproduced by the theoretical curve, which we consider an improvement in respect to the downshifted peak at 4.2 eV shown in Figure 3.6. The comparison between Figures 3.6 and 3.7 gives us conﬁdence that the mixed representation , wheresomestatesareobtainedwithhybridfunctionalsandtheother ones are obtained with a pure GGA (or even a LDA) functional, is a simple and eﬃcient form of obtaining total photoabsorption cross sections of molecular systems. Nevertheless, since the main purpose of this paper is to evaluate the performance of TDDFT in obtaining photoabsorption cross sections, we consider that our calcu- Figure 3.7: C 5H5N (Pyridine mixed representation ).

From the experimental points in Figure 3.11, bottom panel, one can distinguish a very weak band at 4.6 eV followed by a shoulder near 5.8 eV. The weak band at 4.6 eV is reproduced theoretically by a narrow peak which we have assigned as mainly due to a \u0019\u0003 \u0019(A0 A0) singlet transition.

Our theoretical cross section predicts a main peak, above the ﬁrst ionization threshold, with maxima at 17.4 eV (167 Mb).

Chapter 4 Coupled Cluster and Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory Description of Inner-Shell photoabsorption/photoionization Cross Sections of Molecules",
        "4.1 Introduction to the Problem",
        "Simulating photoabsorption spectra for inner-shell states represents a more compli- cated task when compared to the valence region of the spectrum. RPA and TDDFT methods suﬀer from the incomplete handling of relaxation eﬀects for the calculation of core-electron excitation energies. The relaxation eﬀect we refer can be interpreted as a correlation eﬀect since it relates the simultaneous excitation of a core-electron with the relaxation of the remaining ones due to the core-hole left behind. The core holeleftwhenaninner-shellelectronisexcitedorremovedisamuchmoresigniﬁcant perturbation to the molecular electronic structure than the excitation/removal of a valence electron. If no treatment is performed to take into account the relaxation of the core hole density, one ﬁnds considerable errors in the dipole inner-shell transi- tion frequencies. The multielectron excited character present in the hierarchy of CC approaches enables us to recover this relaxation eﬀect in part, with discrepancies in transition energies about 2 eV with singles and doubles excitations, and below 1 eV when triple excitations are included, capturing up to 98% of the relaxation correla- tion energies [87]. Nonetheless, it is a common practice to the users of RPA/TDDFT methods to consider that the error induced by the lack of relaxation of the core hole is systematic and equally distributed to all inner-shell electronic transitions which, indeed, can be shifted with some empirical factor, allowing direct comparison of the calculated spectrum with experimental data [8, 32, 82]. Using the transition frequencies and oscillator strengths coming from inner shell states in equation 1.24 is equivalent to taking the partialcomplex dynamic dipole polarizability from individual channels. Considering that the coupling between the channels from the valence excitation with the inner shell excitations is small enough, we can take the contribution from each channel separately. Converging core-electron photoionization (continuum) proﬁles with L2basis set represents a particular challenge. NEXAFS spectra oscillates quickly within a small energy range until it decreases asymptotically to zero far beyond the ionization po- tential of the measured edge. The simple selection of the complex points used in our previous works [1] for VUV spectra yields strongly oscillating cross section pro- ﬁles. We found that an eﬃcient manner to smooth out the theoretical inner-shell photoionization cross section is to use the principal pseudo-spectra, (\u0016!p i;\u0016fp i)i=1;pas obtained in the Stieltjes imaging procedure [88, 90], in the construction of the com- plex points where the \u000b(z)representation on Eq. (1.24) is evaluated. The Stieltjes principal pseudo-spectra in an L2basis set to calculate inner-shell photoionization cross section has been previously used in the Hartree-Fock (HF) [66] approximation by CARRAVETTA and ÅGREN where the authors show how the Stieltjes imaging technique can be generalized to include high energy electronic continua and also other types of inner shell ionization phenomena. Herein, we apply the principal pseudo-spectra in a diﬀerent way, where we used it as the points in the complex plane used to ﬁt the equation 1.24 via an analytic continuation procedure based on continued fraction functions.",
        "4.2 Computational Details",
        "Vertical excitation energies and oscillator strength for inner-shell electrons were ob- tained for a set of molecular systems at TDDFT level[120, 129] with the hybrid version of the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof GGA functional (PBE0)[138]. In the pre- vious chapter we have shown that good results for the valence region are obtained with PBE0. Therefore, the choice of this functional in this work was natural. The Turbomole program package[55] was used for all TDDFT calculations. Additionally, the asymmetric Lanczos chain version of coupled cluster linear response theory[85] for the hierarchy of coupled cluster CCS, CC2, and CCSD levels, as implemented in the Dalton program package[56] was obtained for the water and ammonia molecules. Lanczos chain length subspace of J= 3000was used for all CC calculations in ac- cordance with previous studies[84]. To allow for the relaxation of the valence space due to the core electron excitation, all electrons have been considered in the active excitation space for all the CC calculations. The construction of the approximation to\u000b(z)(Eq. 1.24) and the analytical continuation procedure applying the discrete electronic spectra were performed as previously described [1, 7]. Correlation consistent (d-)aug-cc-pVTZ basis sets of Dunning and co-workers [130, 131, 157] have been employed throughout the presented calculations. As one of the objectives of the present study is the representation of the cross sections at the bounded and continuum regions of the spectra, continuum-like Gaussian basis functions suited to reproduce the continuum properties of the system, have been employed in our L2basis-set calculations. For this purpose, ﬁve spherical functions ofSandPtype,andfourof Dtype,allofthemobtainedfromtheworkofKaufmann and co-workers[107] were added at the center of mass of all studied systems. The GaussianprimitivesshowninTable4.1areaslightmodiﬁcationoftheonepreviously used in Ref. 1. From now on, we will refer to them as the 5s5p4d continuum-like Experimental equilibrium geometries, obtained from the NIST web page[133], were used for all molecular species. We have used WebPlotDigitizer[134] software in order to obtain the digitized data points from other experimental data.",
        "4.3 Results",
        "The methodology described in the previous sections has already been successfully applied to VUV photoionization spectra [1, 7, 116, 117]. Now we focus our attention to the X-ray region of spectra, for which water and ammonia molecules were used as model systems in order to verify the reliability of our methodology to simulate inner shell photoionization cross sections at CC and TDDFT levels. Next, TDDFT photoionization cross sections are obtained for simple organic molecules, namely, acetaldehyde, acetone, furan, and pyrrole at the carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen K edges. It should be noted that the length of the full-space CCS within the Lanczos approximation is 280 for water and 586 for ammonia and then, for these systems, the CCS excitation energies correspond to the exact full-space calculations. The H 2O and NH 3photoionization cross sections that will be presented also result from the individual transition energy and oscillator strengths, near the O and N ionization K- edges, broadened by Gaussian functions (in arbitrary scale and standard deviation of 0.2 eV) to help visualize the position of the individual transitions of the calculated pseudo-spectra. The excitation energies of selected transitions for water, ammonia, acetaldehyde, acetone, furan and pyrrole are given in Tables 4.2, 4.3 and 4.4.",
        "4.3.1 Water",
        "The high resolution NEXAFS measurements of water obtained by SCHIRMER et al.[158] with synchrotron radiation, in the region below the oxygen K-threshold (539.9 eV[158]), and the results by ISHII et al.[159] with electron energy loss spec- troscopy (EELS) under electric dipole scattering condition are shown in Figure 4.1 with red and blues, respectively. SCHIRMER et al.[158] reported their results in arbitrary units while ISHII et al.[159] reported the absolute cross section values. ADC(2) calculations have been used[158] to study the ﬁve experimental peaks be- low the oxygen K-edge ionization threshold. The authors attributed the ﬁrst two (strong) bands centered at 534.0 and 535.9 eV to the 1s !3s and 1s!3p transi- tions, both with anti-bonding \u001b\u0003character. The width of these bands indicates that both excitations are dissociative. The third band centered at 537.0 eV was assigned to the transitions 1s !3p(a1/b1). The remaining two weaker bands located at 537.9 and 538.5 eV were attributed to members of the O 1s!nsand O 1s!npRydberg series.",
        "In Figure 4.1, we present the photoabsorption cross section spectra obtained at CCS, CC2, CCSD and TDDFT levels for the water molecule. The obtained transitions energies of selected excitations of water are given in Table 4.2. Vertical transitions at TDDFT/PBE0 level using C 2vsymmetry were obtained for 288 a1, 234b1, and 198b2singlet transitions with no frozen orbitals. It is worth emphasizing that as the experimental points indicated by red dots were given in arbitrary units of absorption, we adjusted the absorption scale to match the photoionization tail of the absolute cross section data indicated by the blue dots. The pseudo-spectra obtained at CC levels are not much diﬀerent from those obtained recently by Coriani et al.[84] In Figure 4.1 top left panel, we show the CCS results. The transition O1s !3s is overestimated by 17.1 eV which shows the inadequacy of the CCS level of calculation Furthermore, at this level of calculation the separation between the ﬁrst two transitions is poorly described and as result, the photoabsorption cross section presents a strong peak merging both the O1s ! 3s and O1s!3p contributions and a second weak peak, near the O1s ionization threshold (539.9 eV [158]), representing the density of oscillator strength in that region, as reveled by the Gaussian ﬁt of the excitations (see Table 4.2). At energies above 542 eV, the theoretical results reproduces the experimental photoionization tail of the cross section[159] reported in absolute scale, which means that in spite of the poor representation of the discrete part of the spectrum, CCS is still able to reproduce the experimental photoionization in the continuum region. The CC2 pseudo-spectrum, presented in Figure 4.1 top right, greatly improves the excitation proﬁle. It is worth mentioning that no shift in energy scale was neces- sary. The separation between the peaks corresponding to the O1s !3s and O1s! 3p transitions are in good agreement with the experiment (see Table 4.2), while the transition O1s!3p(a1/b1) and the Rydberg series near the ionization threshold are not distinguishable. In eﬀect, the photoabsorption cross section reproduces the ﬁrst two stronger peaks at 534.0 and 535.9 eV while the remaining ones are smoothened by the photoionization tail up to higher energies of the spectra. The photoionization tail is overestimated when compared to the experimental cross section (blue dots) up to 550 eV. The high density of oscillator strength in the region near the O1s ionization threshold, revealed by the two strong peaks near 540 eV, contributes to the overestimation of the photoionization tail in that region. The CCSD results are presented in the bottom left panel of Figure 4.1. The improvements compared to the CCS and CC2 spectra are clear. The position and separation between the peaks corresponding to the O1s !3s and O1s!3p (see Table 4.2) are in good agreement with the experiments of ISHII et al.[159] and SCHIRMER et al.[158] Two peaks are distinguishable at the position of the O 1s! nsand O 1s!npRydberg series, at 537.9 and 538.5 eV in the Figure, showing good agreement with the high resolution experiment of SCHIRMER et al.[158] The CCSD photoionization cross section reproduces the O1s !3s and O1s!3p peaks but the third one correspondent to the O1s !3p(b1/a1) transition is absent. The proximity between the peaks of the O1s !3p and O1s!3p(b1/a1) transitions (approximately 1 eV apart) is probably the reason for the collapse of both of them in one strong peak at 536.1 eV in the Figure. Although the photoionization cross section does not exhibit enough resolution to distinguish the three weaker peaks (O1s !3p(b1/a1), O1s!nsand O 1s!npRydberg series) below the O1s ionization threshold, the discrete and continuum regions of the spectrum are in reasonable agreement with the experimental data of ISHII et al.[159] The photoabsorption cross section using time-dependent density functional the- ory is shown in the Figure 4.1 bottom right panel together with the Gaussian ﬁt of the pseudo-spectrum and experimental data. The Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof hybrid functional (PBE0) was adopted in our present X-ray study because it has already been tested in our previous VUV photoionization study [1] showing good perfor- mance compared with other largely used DFT functionals. The inner shell transi- tions from the O1s are underestimated by 13.6 eV. The shift in the energy scale is similar, in module, to that used for the CCS spectrum, but the energy separation between the ﬁrst three peaks, on the other hand, is well reproduced. As shown in Table 4.2 the TDDFT/PBE0 O1s !3s (a1!a1) transition at 520.5 eV; the O1s are all in agreement with previous assignments[158]. Apart from the high shift in the energy scale, the discrete part of the photoabsorption spectrum resembles those from CC2 and CCSD, and the tail in the continuum of the TDDFT spectrum is better represented than in the CCSD spectrum. These results indicate that despite the high energy error in the K-shell states the TDDFT photoionization spectrum is still reliable, provided an empirical shift in the energy scale is applied.",

        "In the high resolution theoretical-experimental study of SCHIRMER et al.[158], ﬁve distinct peaks were distinguished and ADC(2) calculations were used to ascribe theexperimentalpeaks, theﬁrstcenteredat400.6eVduetotheN1s !3stransition, the second centered at 402.3 eV corresponding to the transition N1s !3p(e), the third at 402.8 eV due to the N1s !3p(a1) transition, the fourth at 403.6 eV due to the N1s!4s transition and the ﬁfth at 404.2 eV due to the N1s !3p(e) transition. The CCS photoionization cross section is presented in the top left panel of Figure eV. Similarly to the CCS spectrum of the O1s edge in H 2O, the separation of the N1s!ns and np transitions is not correctly described. In eﬀect, one single strong peak appears as the result of the collapse of the N1s !3s, N1s!3p(e), and the N1s!3p(a1) transitions. Above the N1s ionization threshold (405.5[160] eV) the photoionization tail reproduces the experimental tendency. We emphasize that the experimental absorption data were given in relative scale[158, 160], therefore, the experimental photoionzation tail was adjusted to match the theoretical proﬁle. The CC2 calculation, presented in the top right panel of Figure 4.2, reproduces the experimental photoionization proﬁle with reasonable agreement. The transition N1s!3s is 1.0 eV above the experimental peak (see Table 4.2). Although the N1s!3s, N1s!3p(e), and N1s!3p(a1) transitions are distinguishable, the cor- responding oscillator strengths are misrepresented. Therefore, the photoionization cross section shows the N1s !3p(e) peak, at 402.9 eV in the Figure, as a weak peak followed by a broad and weak peak at 403.7 eV, due to the N1s !3p(a1) transition. The CCSD photoabsorption cross section is presented in the bottom left panel of Figure 4.2. The CCSD oscillator strengths for the N1s !3s, N1s!3s(e), and N1s !3p(a1) transitions are considerably improved in comparison to the CC2 pseudo- spectrum showing good agreement with the experimental proﬁle. In eﬀect, the ﬁrst two peaks of the photoionization cross section spectrum reproduce the experimental tendency. Once again, the present methodology has not enough resolution to resolve theweakerdiscretepeaksnearthethreshold, i.e., thepeakscorrespondenttotheN1s !3p(a1) (404.3 eV), and N1s !4s (404.9 eV, see Table 4.2) transitions. Instead, since these transitions are weak and close to each other, the calculation gives rise to a broad and weak peak at 405 eV on the Figure, near the N1s ionization threshold. Finally, the TDDFT/PBE0 photoionization cross section shown in the bottom rightpaneloftheFigure4.2, reproducesthepeakcorrespondingtotheﬁrstN1s !3s transition 11.7 eV too low. Despite the high diﬀerence from the experimental data, the separation of the TDDFT peaks and their corresponding oscillator strengths reproduce the experimental proﬁle. Similar to the CC results, the TDDFT pho- toabsorption cross section has not enough resolution to separate the weaker peaks near the N1s threshold, instead a weak and broad peak at 403.5 eV in the Figure is observed followed by a smooth tail above the ionization threshold. The NH 3and H 2O CC and TDDFT photoabsorption cross sections obtained in this work so far corroborate with the hypothesis that the present methodology can provide theoretical inner-shell photoabsorption cross sections to support experimen- tal data. In the following examples this methodology is applied to a number organic molecules, namely, acetaldehyde, acetone, furan, and pyrrole at the TDDFT/PBE0 level within the frozen valence shell approximation, and the photoabsorption cross section at the carbon, nitrogen and oxygen K-edges are compared with the experi- mental data.",

        "High resolution acetaldehyde experimental results have been reported by PRINCE et al.[161] using synchrotron radiation and in low resolution by HITCH- COCK and BRION[162] using the electron energy loss spectra (EELS) technique. Both results were reported in absolute scale and are presented in Figure 4.3 with red and blue dots, respectively. The experimental spectrum at the oxygen K-edge shows an intense peak centered at 531 eV assigned to a \u0019\u0003 O1s transition fol- lowed by two less intense transitions to 3s and 3p states[161] (535 and 536 eV, respectively). According to the XPS experiments[162], the acetaldehyde oxygen 1s ionization threshold is 538.6 eV while the vertical ionization energy obtained at TDDFT/PBE0 level was 537.7 eV. The vertical ionization energy[163] is calculated as the energy diﬀerence between the ground state energy ( n electrons ) and that one of the system with a core-hole ( n-1 electrons ) at the equilibrium geometry, i.e., without relaxing the geometry due to the core-hole, but just the electronic density. Theoretical core excitation energies were recently obtained by MYHRE et al.[60] at several CC levels. The authors obtained a value of 534.6 eV excitation energy for the\u0019\u0003 O1s transition with singles and doubles excitations in multi-level couped cluster approximation (MLCCSD), which corresponds to a 2 eV error in the tran- sition energy.

Core excitation energies at the carbon K-edge have been also reported at the MLCCSD level.[60] The authors obtained a value of 288.5 eV transition energy and of 0.0638 for the oscillator strength of the \u0019\u0003 C(C=O)1s transition and 290.7 eV for the energy and of 0.0203 for the oscillator strength of the \u0019\u0003 C(CH 3)1s transition which corresponds to approximately 2 eV error in transition energy. The experimental results[161] (Figure 4.3, bottom panel) shows three intense peaks at 286.2 eV, 288.4 eV and 290.2 eV which were assigned by PRINCE et al.to the\u0019\u0003 C(C=O)1s, to \u0019\u0003 C(CH 3)1s and to the \u0019\u0003 C(CH 3)1s transitions, respectively. According to the XPS results[162], the carbon ionization thresholds are 291.3 eV for methyl and 294.0 eV for the carbonyl group. The computed DFT vertical ioniza- tion energies were of 288.2 eV for methyl and of 293.6 eV for the carbonyl with the PBE0 functional, in good agreement with experimental data.

The oxygen K shell pseudo-spectrum was calculated allowing transitions from the 1s orbital to all virtual orbitals, keeping the remaining occupied orbitals frozen generating 175 a aand 169b avertical transitions in the C2symmetry. The carbon K shell pseudo-spectrum was obtained allowing transitions from the three carbon 1s orbitals to all the virtuals generating 521a aand 515b asinglet states.

        "TheexperimentalNEXAFSspectrumforoxygenobtainedbyPRINCE et al.[161] is shown in Figure 4.4, top panel. The spectrum exhibits a intense peak centered at 531.4 eV which was ascribed to the \u0019\u0003 O1s transition followed by a weak 3p O 1s transition at 535.6 eV (see Table 4.3). According to the XPS experiments,[162] the oxygen K-edge ionization threshold is 537.9 eV while the vertical ionization en- ergy obtained at the DFT/PBE0 level was 537.1 eV, in good agreement with the experimental data. The oxygen K-edge photoabsorption cross section is presented in Figure 4.4, top panel. The TDDFT/PBE0 energy of the \u0019\u0003 O1s transition is 12.8 eV below the experimental peak, thus a shift of +12.8 eV was applied to the theoretical energy scale in Fig. 4.4 to better compare the results with the experi- ments. The calculated oxygen K-edge photoabsorption cross section reproduces the intense peak at 531.3 eV, which we have attributed to a \u0019\u0003 O1s transition, in agreement with the experiment[161]. There is also a reasonable agreement between the theoretical and experimental photoabsorption cross sections in the region above the O1s threshold. The theoretical photoionization tail reproduces the experimental tendency except for the broad and weak peak centered at 547 eV. The acetone carbon K shell photoabsorption cross section is presented in Figure 4.4, bottom panel, together with experimental data[161].

According to the XPS experiments[162] the carbon K-edge ionization threshold is vertical ionization energies are 286.5 eV for the methyl carbon and 293.3 eV for the carbonyl carbon, in reasonable agreement with the experimental data (see Table 4.3). The calculated carbon K-edge photoabsorption cross section shown in Figure 4.4 bottom panel, reproduces the two intense peaks but with the energies 9.8 eV below the experimental results. Therefore, we shifted the theoretical energy scale by +9.8 eV to better compare with the experimental data. The ﬁrst peak at 286.6 eV in the Figure has been assigned to the \u0019\u0003 C(C=O)1s transition and the second peak, at 287.7 eV, to the \u0019\u0003 C(CH 3)1s transition, both of them in agreement with previous assignments[161]. It can be observed that the experimental photoabsorp- tion proﬁle is reasonably reproduced for the discrete as well as for the continuum part of the spectrum. The photoionization tail is satisfactorily reproduced by the present calculation showing reasonable agreement with experimental data. Theoretical core excitation energies at the TDDFT level with BLYP functional andhybridbasissetschemecombiningaug-cc-pVTZwithplanewavesintheGAPW approximation were reported by IANNUZZI and HUTTER[164].

They obtained a valued of 275.8 eV for the \u0019\u0003 C(C=O)1s transition energy. The energy error was about 10.6 eV, which is a value compatible with the ones we obtained with PBE0 functional.",

Chain-length subspaces of J= 250 and 500 were used. The pseudo-spectra were subsequently fed into the Stieltjes imaging procedure [91, 92] and the analytic continuation procedure based on Padé approximants functions,[2] to generate the continuum part of the cross sections proﬁles. Both the Stieltjes imaging and the analytic continuation procedures were implemented as stand-alone Fortran90 codes. [2, 91] Stieltjes Imaging is known to be susceptible to numerical errors due to the fact that it involves recursive calculation of a number of quantities. As the positive spectral moments S(k)diverge for k>2, Stieltjes imaging was performed using the negative spectral moments. Stieltjes orders of 2–20 were typically computed[91, 92]. However, only those which are well converged (indicated in the ﬁgures) were interpo- lated to obtain the X-ray photo-ionization cross-sections. Cubic spline interpolation was used in such cases.",

An adequate description of this region has been shown to be attainable [7, 91, 92] by using the continuum-like basis functions proposed by KAUFMANN et al..[107] Therefore, sets of s, p, d and f continuum-like functions, generated according to the prescriptions of Kaufmann and co-workers, [107] were added to the centre of mass of the molecules considered. We have tested diﬀerent continuum sets by varying the quantum numbers nin the Kaufmann’s recipe where we observed that the set with nranging from 2 up to 8 is a better compromise between accuracy and computational cost. Therefore, we will report and discuss here results obtained using Kaufmann’s quantum numbers n ranging from 2 up to 8.

        "The experimental cross section[173] of ethylene presents three main peaks below the ionization threshold assigned as follows: the ﬁrst one, at 284.7 eV,[173] to a C1s !\u0019\u0003transition, the second one, at 287.8 eV, to a C1s !3s;3ptransitions and the third one, at 289.3 eV, to a C1s !4ptransition. As it can be observed in panels 5.1a and 5.1b, the cross-section below the IE limit as well as the continuum tail are already converged at J=250, as no signiﬁcant diﬀerences can be seen in the J=250 andJ=500spectra. This is an indication that the chain length J=250is suﬃciently large to treat the discrete as well as the continuum regions of the spectra. Both Padé and Stieltjes procedures yield cross section proﬁles well above the ionization limit of comparable quality and in reasonable good agreement with the experimental data.

        "the IE, the Padé procedure is unable to describe all of the experimental spectral features, which, on the other hand, are neatly obtained by the Lorentzian broaden- ing of the Lanczos sticks. In the Padé analytic continuation procedure, nonetheless, the discrete and the continuum cross sections are continuously connected, due to the analytic treatment, avoiding the discontinuity at the threshold connecting the discrete spectrum obtained by Lorentzian broadening and the continuum part pro- vided by Stieltjes Imaging. Inclusion of additional continuum-like functions of f character has a moderate, but still noticeable, eﬀect especially on the Padé results, slightly improving the continuum tail above 305 eV, but enhancing the broad band at around 298 eV (see Fig. 5.1d).",
        "As for the comparison between CVS-CCSD and CVS-CC2, it is evident from Figs. 5.1a and 5.1c that, for the K-edge of ethylene, CVS-CC2 is less accurate than CCSD both below and above the IE limit, as well as the IE value itself, most probably due to the lack of description of double excitations, which are important to describe orbital relaxation.",
        "The Pople set 6-311++G** is a rather popular choice of basis set for XAS cal- culations, [70, 127, 174] and in Fig. 5.2 we show how it performs when coupled with the same continuum-like [107] sets and Jvalue used in Figs. 5.1a and Figs. 5.1d. Up to the IE, the main diﬀerences observed when compared to the aug-cc-pVTZ results are in the positions of the C1s !\u0019\u0003peak and of the IE with respect to their exper- imental ones. The energy diﬀerence between the experimental and the calculated CVS-CCSD C1s!\u0019\u0003transition is 1.27 eV for the 6-311++G** basis set, versus 0.83 eV for the aug-cc-pVTZ basis. The IE is found at 292.0 eV, versus 291.6 eV of the aug-cc-pVTZ basis. The 6-311++G** set is thus slightly less accurate than the aug-cc-pVTZ basis set up to the IE limit. Above the IE, one observes more clustered groups of discrete pseudo-excited states than obtained with the Dunning set, which can possibly explain the presence of slight oscillations in the cross section from the analytic continuation procedure. After increasing the continuum-like set with extra ffunctions, i.e.(7s7p7d7f) n=2\u00008, the calculated cross section in Fig.5.3 is similar to the one of Fig. 5.1d, with an improved continuum tail above 305 eV when compared to experiment, but with the appearance of a broad band at around 298 eV that is not present in the experimental cross section. The 6-311++G** basis set should probably be used with some care when aiming at the photoionization part of the XAS cross section.",

The computed cross sections are compared to the experimental results of electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) under the electric dipole scattering condition, obtained by MCLAREN et al.[173] Below the O1s ionization threshold, the CO 2cross section presents an intense peak centered at 535.4 eV due to a O1s !\u0019\u0003transition. The energy diﬀerence \u0001 between the experimental and the calculated O1s !\u0019\u0003transition is 1.56 eV and 0.05 eV at the CVS-CCSD and CVS-CC2 levels, respectively. The IEs are found at 542.9 eV for CVS-CCSD and 539.0 eV for CVS-CC2, versus the experimental value of 541.3 eV. Even if the systematic shift \u0001is smaller in the CVS-CC2 case than for CVS-CCSD, the agreement between the shifted CVS-CCSD ionization threshold and the experimental value (see vertical dashed lines in Fig. 5.7) is better than in the CVS-CC2 case.",
        "Above the ionization threshold, the experimental continuum cross section ex- hibits a broad band with oﬀset at around 560 eV, with a maximum of 1.7 Mb, after which it decreases for a nearly constant plateau of roughly 1 Mb. The broad feature above 560 eV and the continuum tail up to 620 eV are well described by both procedures, whose overall spectral features are very similar to each other. Comparing 5.5 and 5.6, we note that CVS-CCSD and CVS-CC2 yield rather similar (shifted) cross sections for the O K-edge of CO 2, with CVS-CCSD marginally more accurate than the CVS-CC2 one.",
        "The C K-shell cross sections of CO 2are presented in Fig. 5.10 along with exper- imental results.[173] The strong absorption peak at 290.8 eV is known to originate from the C1s!\u0019\u0003transition [173, 175], which we found at 0.33 eV and 1.68 eV higher in energy at CVS-CCSD and CVS-CC2 level, respectively. Opposite to the O K-edge case, the shift \u0001is thus smaller for CCSD than for CC2. Also diﬀerent from the O K-edge case, the shifted CC2 IE is closer to the experimental value than the CCSD one.",
        "The calculated cross sections show, similarly to the oxygen edge, that the Stielt- jes and the Padé approximants procedures yield very similar photoionization cross sections above the IE limit. While the computed cross sections follow rather closely the experimental one up to 360 eV, at higher energies, and in particular near 380 eV, a broad feature arises in the computed proﬁles, that is not observed in the experiment.",

As in the previous cases, the continuum part of the spectra shown in Figs. 5.11 and 5.12 was treated with both the Padé analytic continuation procedure and with Stieltjes Imaging, while the discrete sticks were broadened with Lorentzian functions with HWHM=0.54 eV for CCSD and 0.41 eV for CC2. The experimental peaks below the oxygen K-edge ionization threshold have been extensivelystudiedatdiﬀerentlevelsoftheory, suchasCCSD,[2,84,127]TDDFT,[2] and ADC(2). [158] The ﬁrst two bands centered at 534.0 and 535.9 eV have been assignedtotheO1s !3sandO1s!3ptransitions. Thewidthofthesebandsindicates that both excitations have dissociative character. The third band centered at 537.0 eV has been attributed to the O1s !3p(a1/b1) transition and the remaining weaker bands located at 537.9 and 538.5 eV were assigned to members of the O1s !ns and O1s!np Rydberg series. The ﬁrst three features are also described by the present CVS-CCSD and CVS-CC2 calculations, though with quite diﬀerent relative intensities, as also observed previously. [84] The shifted CVS-CCSD ionization threshold (dashed red line) is clearly in better agreement with the experimental value at 539.7 eV (see the caption in Fig. 5.13) than the (shifted) CVS-CC2 ionization energy.",
        "Above the IE, the photoionization cross sections yielded by both continuum procedures and CC approximations noticeably deviate from the experimental result in the region between 540 and 555 eV. The Padé cross section, in particular, shows a slight oscillatory trend, which is smoothed in the Stieltjes case. As also shown in a previous study,[2] the cross section below the IE threshold obtained with the Padé approximants only accounts for the two intense peaks dominated by the O1s !3s and O1s!3p transitions.",

Experimental results are from Ref. 160. the CVS-CCSD and CVS-CC2 levels of calculation are presented together with the experimental EELS data by SODHI and BRION.[160] The calculations were per- formed in the aug-cc-pVTZ basis+(7s7p7d) n=2\u00008continuum-like set. The Lanczos chain was truncated at J=500. Since the experimental cross sections were given in arbitrary scale, the experimental photoionization tail was adjusted to match the the- oretical curve. The photoabsorption cross section of ammonia presents four distinct peaks below the IE: the ﬁrst one, centered at 400.6 eV, has been attributed to the N1s!3s transition, the second one at 402.3 eV has been assigned to the N1s !3p(e) transition, the third one centered at 402.8 eV to the N1s !3p(a1) transition, and the fourth one, at 403.6 eV, to the N1s !4s transition. [84, 158] The discrete part of the spectrum presented in panel 5.14, obtained by Lorentzian broadening the discrete CCSD sticks with HWHM=0.27 eV, describes the above-mentioned experimental features, in agreement with previous studies.[2, 85] As also discussed in Ref.[2], the analytic continuation procedure applied to the discrete region does not have enough resolution to distinguish all the discrete peaks and, normally, only the most intense transitions, in this case the N1s !3s and the N1s!3p transitions, are obtained. The shifted N 1s\u00001IE CVS-CCSD ionization energy (dashed red line) is in very good agreement with the experimental value (405.6 eV), while the shifted CC2 one IE is signiﬁcantly underestimated, as also observed for the O and C IEs in the previously discussed systems.",
        "Above the IE, our results show that the continuum parts of the spectra treated withbothcontinuumproceduresandCClevelsareinverygoodagreementwitheach other and with the experimental result but one should keep in mind the experiment has been scaled to match the computed continuum tail. As previously mentioned, a recent study by some of us[2] reported a theoretical description of the N1s cross section spectrum of the ammonia molecule calculated at the TDDFT as well as the CCS, CC2 and CCSD levels of theory in full space. That study [2] indicated that the CCSD photoionization cross sections are more accurate compared with the results obtained at the other levels of theory there employed. 5.3.5 Full space vs.CVS photoionization cross sections: the ammonia and ethylene cases In Fig. 5.19, we compare the photoionization cross sections of ammonia and ethylene obtained via a full-space CCSD calculation (blue lines) with the CVS-CCSD cross sections (purple lines) that were also shown in Figs. 5.14 and 5.1a. In the full- space calculation, all types of occupied orbitals are allowed to participate in the manifold of excitations out of the reference state.

The experimental results are from Refs. 160, 173. same basis set of Figs. 5.14 and 5.1a was used. For both molecules the full space calculation roughly reproduces the same features obtained in the CVS calculation. However, in the case of ammonia, one can notice the appearance of a broad band centered at 409 eV and a more oscillating continuum tail, compared with the CVS result. The oscillatory behavior of the full-space photoionization cross section is most probably related to the inclusion of the excitations of valence electrons in the X-ray region, giving rise to a \"background noise\" of pure valence excitations into the core-excitation region. This background noise is speciﬁcally removed via the CVS scheme. This behavior indicates that the Padé procedure is very sensitive to small changes in the pseudo spectrum. We also note in passing that Stieltjes Imaging cannot be straightforwardly applied to the full-space stick spectrum unless one explicitly leaves out all excitations below the ﬁrst core excited one.",

The high energy tail of the photoionization cross sections follows closely the experimental tail at both CVS-CCSD and CVS-CC2 levels. The Padé procedure at both CC levels yields a broad band above the IE threshold at 406.7 eV (which has been assigned to a N 1s !\u001b\u0003(C\u0000N)transition), though with much higher intensity than the experimental, as well as a slight rise at around 415 eV.",

The C 1s !\u0019\u0003transition energy calculated at the CVS-CCSD and CVS-CC2 levels is higher than the experimental value by 1.91 and 3.30 eV, respectively. Once again, the shifted carbon K-edge CVS-CCSD ionization energies, represented by dashed lines in Fig. 5.31, are in better agreement with the experimental values than the CVS-CC2 results. The continuum part of both spectra show good agreement with the experimental continuum tail proﬁle. The CVS-CC2 photoabsorption cross sections, Fig. 5.30, look very similar to the CVS-CCSD ones at both the discrete and the continuum regions of the spectra. We also performed CVS-CCSD calculations using the continuum-like set em- ployed in Ref. [2] where the photoionization cross section of pyrrole was obtained at the TDDFT/PBE0 level with the d-aug-cc-pVTZ atomic basis set complemented with a speciﬁcally tailored (5s5p4d) continuum-like set placed at the center of mass of the system. The CVS-CCSD results are presented in Fig.5.34 along with the ex- perimental values. Fig. 5.32 shows the nitrogen K-edge photoionization cross section and Fig. 5.33 the carbon K-edge results, all of them obtained with the aug-cc-pVTZ basis on N and C, the aug-cc-pVDZ on H, and the (5s5p4d) continuum set as de- ﬁned in Ref. [2]. Considering the ﬁrst results for nitrogen, it can be seen that the cross section generated by the Stieltjes Imaging procedure is very similar to the one obtained with (7s7p7d) n=2\u00008set of KAUFMANN et al.(see panel 5.26). The major diﬀerence between the two continuum sets is observed when using the Padé ana- lytic continuation procedure. Comparing the corresponding Padé cross sections of Fig. 5.26 and 5.32, one can notice the presence of a strong band near 418 eV when the 5s,5p,4d continuum set is used. The pyrrole results in Ref. 2 do not look so bad because the larger and more diﬀuse d-aug-cc-pVTZ basis set somehow compen- sated the poor description of the continuum provided by the (5s5p4d) set. This also shows that it is possible to reduce the size of the atomic basis set as long as a proper continuum-like set is used. At the C K-edge, on the other hand, the photoionization cross sections obtained with the 5s,5p,4d continuum set are very similar to those obtained with the Kaufmann’s[107] n=2,8(s,p,d) continuum-like set.",

The Lanczos chain length was truncated at J= 250. The experimental values for furan are reported in arbitrary units and are scaled such that the continuum tail of the experimental photoionization cross section matches the theoretical one. The O K-edge photoabsorption spectrum[166] of furan presents an intense and narrow band centered at 535.3 eV assigned to a O 1s !\u0019\u0003transition, followed by a broader and less intense band centered at 539.4 eV attributed to O1s !\u001b\u0003(C- O) transitions. Above the O 1s\u00001IE, a broad peak centered at 545.3 eV has been assigned to the O 1s !\u001b\u0003(C-C) transition.[166] DUFLOT et al.[167] reported the- oretical results for the furan O 1s !\u0019\u0003and O1s!\u001b\u0003transition energies at 535.6 eV and 540.0 eV, respectively, obtained from CIS calculations using core-relaxed molecular orbitals with the TZP basis set supplemented with a set of Rydberg or- bitals (3s3p3d4s4p) on the core-excited atom. Our excitation energies for the O1s !\u0019\u0003transition at the CVS-CCSD and CVS-CC2 levels are 1.54 and 0.45 eV above the corresponding experimental value, respectively. The O 1s\u00001IEs calculated at the CVS-CCSD and CVS-CC2 levels are represented by the red dashed lines in Fig. 5.37, shifted by the same amount used to shift the NEXAFS spectrum.

These results [44] showed the need to include double excitation eﬀects in order to obtain reasonable photoionization cross sections of transient states.

        "From Fig. 6.2, one can observe a reasonable agreement between the EOM-CCSD and the ADC(2)-x[44] photoionization cross sections from the1B1excited state. In the region above 30 eV the EOM-CCSD and the ADC(2)-x cross sections exhibit the same cross section decay at both geometries here considered. In the region around 20 eV, the EOM-CCSD cross section is narrower and slightly shifted, falling in between the ADC(2)-x and the ADC(2) ones. Analogous behavior is observed for the EOM-CCSD cross section at the lowest energy geometry of the excited-state shown in the bottom panel of Fig. 6.2. All in all, the EOM-CCSD photoionization cross section agrees better with the results of the ADC(2)-x calculations than with the ones from ADC(2).",
        "The photoionization cross sections of the1A2excited state, shown in Fig. 6.3, shows more spectral structures than the ones of the1B1state. Also, there is a large diﬀerence between the results computed at the equilibrium geometry and the one obtained at the excited state geometry. For example, taking the Padé analytic curves, the maximum cross section (27 Mb) obtained with the ground state equilib- rium geometry occurs at 37 eV (24 Mb by the Stieltjes highest point) and at 20 eV with 22 Mb when the calculation is performed at the excited state geometry. This is a clear evidence that the photoionization cross sections from the1A2transient state is much more sensitive to geometry changes than from the1B1excited state. The cross sections obtained with the analytic Padé procedure are in reasonable agreement with the Stieltjes cross section points.

The results of RUBERTI et al.[44] at the ADC(2)-x and ADC(2) levels, respectively, are 9.64 and 10.15 eV for the1\u0006\u0000excited state and 8.32 and 8.85 eV for the1\u0005 excited state.

        "The cross sections in Fig. 6.4 for the excited1\u0006\u0000state at the ground state (top panel) and at the excited state geometry (bottom panel) are intermediate between the ADC(2)-x and ADC(2) curves,[44] in the whole spectral region, i.e., red shifted relative to the ADC(2) cross section and blue shifted relative to the ADC(2)-x curve. Our analytic Padé cross section calculated at the ground state equilibrium geometry presents a maximum at 28 eV with 24 Mb. This maximum is 6 eV blue shifted relative to the ADC(2)-x maximum and 10 eV red shifted relative to the ADC(2) maximum. The ADC(2)-x is known to underestimate excitation energies due to its unbalanced description of correlation eﬀects in the ground and excited states, which leads to systematic red shift of the excitation energies while ADC(2) is known to give a poor description of states with large contributions from double excitations overestimating Rydberg excitations and ionization (see Ref. 185). Thus, CCSD reestablishes this correlation balance and gives excitation energies between those from the ADC(2)-x and ADC(2) methods.",

        "7.1 Introduction to the Problem",
        "The subject of hydrogen bonds represents a wide research ﬁeld [9, 192–199] since the strong dipole interaction in the molecular aggregates is able to modify the electronic structureoftheindividualmoleculesgivingrisetoalargenumberofpropertiesas,for example,theenhancementofchargetransferprocess[197]andﬂuorescencequenching [198]. Formic acid (HCOOH), the simplest carboxylic acid, is of underlying interest to natural sciences since it is the simplest model for studying biomolecules with carboxyl functional groups like, for example, lactic acid, acetic acid, amino acids and DNA base pairs. The carboxyl group ( \u0000COOH) has two sites available for hydrogen bond formation and the dimeric structure formed through doubly bridged hydrogen bonds is highly stable. The most stable dimer of formic acid has binding energy [193] around 15 kcal/mol and a cyclic structure. Heavier clusters such as (HCOOH) n (n\u00153) and ionic clusters have been reported using ab initio and density functional theory(DFT)calculations[200–203]. Moreover, itisalsoofinterestthephotophysics behaviorofthesemolecularaggregatesandparticularlytheroleofthehydrogenbond on the electronic excitation to bond states and to the photoionization process. The interpretation of the photoabsorption/photoionization cross section spectra of the formic acid hydrogen bonded clusters can provide valuable information about their electronic structures.",
        "Spectroscopic experiments on the formic acid in the region of the oxygen and carbon K-shells have been reported with electron energy loss spectrum (EELS)[204, 205], high resolution near edge X-Ray absorption ﬁne structure (NEXAFS)[206], and total ion yield (TIY)[194, 207] techniques. Regarding the oxygen K-shell region, these studies revealed an intense peak, at 532.2 eV, assigned to the O1s CO!\u0019\u0003 transition, and a band at 535.1 eV, assigned to the O1s OH!\u0019\u0003/\u001b\u0003transitions, followed by the Rydberg transitions in the pre-edge region. The TIY experiments under clustering condition[194, 207] have shown a blue shift of the O1s CO!\u0019\u0003peak by 0.2 eV and a red shift of the O1s OH!\u0019\u0003/\u001b\u0003 band by 0.6 eV and a broadening of the spectrum followed by a considerable relative increase in the continuum region of the spectrum. Recently, TAKAHASHI et al. used TDDFT calculations to analyze the NEXAFS spectra of formic acid and its small clusters at the O K-edge where the inﬂuence of the hydrogen bonds on the discrete part of the spectra was discussed. Vacuum ultra violet (VUV) experiments [208, 209] have been reported and the implications of the clustering on the valence transitions were also discussed [209]. CIMAS et al.[192] have reported a multi- state complete active space second order perturbation theory (MS-CASPT2) study on the valence singlet electronic excited states of formic acid dimer and its mono- substituted thioderivatives. Nevertheless, a more complete study covering both the discrete and continuum regions of the spectra of these systems at the VUV and X-Ray regions still represents a considerable challenge mainly due to the lack of a widespread correlated ab initio method based on quadratically integrable basis set to treat the continuum process.",
        "7.2 Computational Details",
        "Geometry optimizations for the formic acid, HCOOH, and its hydrogen-bonded small clusters, i.e., (HCOOH) 2, HCOOH+ 2, HCOHOH+, and HCOOH\u0001H3O+have been performed at the DFT level using the D3 dispersion correction of Grimme and co-workes[210] and the CAM-B3LYP hybrid exchange-correlation functional[211] with the aug-cc-pVTZ basis set.[130] The optimized geometry coordinates are avail- ableassupplementarysourcematerial. Thegeometryoptimizationcalculationshave been performed with the Gaussian09 program package[212]. Vertical excitation energies and oscillator strengths were obtained for the opti- mized structures using TDDFT with dispersion correction D3[210] and the hybrid version of the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof GGA functional (PBE0) with the Turbomole program package[55] making use of resolution of the identity technique (RI)[140]. Our previous works[1, 2] have shown that good results for the valence as well as inner shell regions are obtained with PBE0 functional. Therefore, the choice of this functional in this work was natural. Correlation consistent valence triple-zeta basis sets of Dunning and co-workers[130, 131], namely aug-cc-pVTZ, have been employed in all TDDFT calculations. Since we want to obtain the inner-shell cross sections in the bound and continuum regions of the spectra, continuum-like Gaussian basis functions tailored to reproduce the continuum properties of the system have been employed in our L2basis-set calculations. For this purpose, were added at the center of mass of all the studied systems a continuum-type set of S,P, and Dfunctions obtained from the work of Kaufmann et al.[107] withnranging from 2 to 8. From now on we will refer to this set as 7s7p7d continuum-like set . The inner-shell photoabsorption cross-sections at the oxygen and carbon K-edges were obtained in the core-valence separation approximation where the active space for the electronic excitation is formed by the respective core orbitals, keeping all the other core and valence orbitals frozen. The construction of the approximation to\u000b(z)(Eq. 1.24) and the analytical continuation procedure applying the discrete electronic spectra were performed in a stand-alone Fortran code implemented by the author.",
        "Inner-shell TDDFT calculations within the core-valence separation approxima- tion is known to reproduce an error in the energy scale due to the lack of proper treatment of the inner-shell relaxation eﬀect caused by the hole left by the outgoing excited core electron[2]. Nevertheless, the energy error is nearly systematic, and it is common practice to apply an energy shift to the calculated values to better compare them with the experimental results.",
        "To give support to the TDDFT calculations, a series of high-level ab initio quantum-mechanical calculations were performed at the Symmetry-Adapted Cluster Conﬁguration Interaction (SAC-CI)[213] level of theory performed with the Gaus- sian09programpackage[212]. Theinner-shelltransitionenergies, oscillatorstrengths andionizationenergiesoftheformicacidanditshydrogen-bondedsmallclusters i.e., HCOOH, (HCOOH) 2, HCOOH+ 2, HCOHOH+, and HCOOH\u0001H3O+were obtained with the aug-cc-pCVDZ basis set[130, 131]. The SAC-CI wave function with singles and doubles excitations were obtained for the oxygen K-shell states at the core- valence separation approximation where the singles and doubles excitation manifold include at least one of the oxygen 1s electron. Contrarily to the TDDFT framework, the described (core-valence separated) SAC-CI singles and doubles wave functions are able to recover the relaxation eﬀect due to the core hole left after the inner-shell electronic excitation. Further considerations about the relaxation eﬀect willbe given in what follows.",

        "The DFT optimized geometry of the dimer form of formic acid, obtained with CAM- B3LYP/aug-cc-pVTZ and D3 dispersion correction[210], are in good agreement with other results,[192, 193] with the O \u0001\u0001\u0001HO hydrogen bond lengths being 1.65 Å, and 1.76 Å in the HCOOH \u0001H3O+structure. The optimized geometry ﬁles are available as supplementary material.",
        "The carbon K-edge NEXAFS photoabsorption/photoionization cross section for the free formic acid is shown in Figure 7.1 along with experimental high-resolution NEXAFS cross section[206]. In Figure 7.1 we also show the peaks broadened with Gaussian functions with a full-width-at-half maximum of 0.2 eV and arbitrary inten- sity to help with the peak assignments within the discrete part of the spectrum. The dashed vertical line indicates the experimental carbon 1s ionization potential[206] at 295.9 eV. As mentioned before, the TDDFT core-valence separation space for inner- shell states cannot take properly into account the relaxation eﬀects caused by the core electron excitation, and the theoretical spectrum is shifted relative to the ex- perimental NEXAFS spectrum. However, the energy shift is nearly systematic and as long as an experimental energy shift is applied to the theoretical scale, the results can be compared with the experimental data. For the case of C 1s the energy shift is +10.2 eV (see Reference 2). The cross section shown in Figure 7.1 exhibits the ﬁrst strong peak at 288.1 eV due to C 1s !\u0019\u0003transition and the second weak peak at 291.7 eV in a region of transitions to Rydberg states. Above the C 1s threshold the cross section shows a maximum at 297 eV, in agreement with the experiments, and decreases with a continuum tail. With exception of the second Rydberg peak at 293.1 eV and a small blue shift on the peak at 291.5 eV, the calculated cross section is in satisfactory agreement with the experimental data, exhibiting the prin- cipal features of the high-resolution NEXAFS experiment. The assignments due to transitions from the C 1s to bound states are in agreement with other studies[206]. The formic acid monomer and dimer NEXAFS photoabsorption/photoionization cross sections at the oxygen K-shell are presented in the Figure 7.2 along with exper- imental data[204, 206] and the Gaussian broadening of the calculated peaks below the ionization thresholds. An energy shift of +12.8 eV was applied to the plot scale to better compare with the experimental results. In the top panel, we present the re- sults for the formic acid compared with high-resolution NEXAFS cross section[206] (in red) and the EELS arbitrary intensity measurements (in purple)[204]. The EELS points were scaled to match the intensity of the second band, O OH1s!\u0019\u0003=\u001b\u0003, of the NEXAFS cross section[206]. The theoretical TDDFT and SAC-CI peaks assign- ments of the formic acid and some hydrogen-bonded clusters are presented in Table 7.1. It is worth noticing that for the formic acid monomer the energy diﬀerence between the calculated O CO1s!\u0019\u0003transition and the experimental value is of 3.1 eV at the SAC-CI and of \u000012.8 eV at the TDDFT level, showing that the relaxation eﬀect is properly treated in the SAC-CI calculation. The oxygen K-shell ionization energies of the HCOOH, (HCOOH) 2, HCOOH+ HCOHOH+, and HCOOH\u0001H3O+species were also calculated at the SAC-CI level and the results are presented in Table 7.2. The formic acid monomer results show a good agreement with the experimental ionization energies[206] if the same shift of +3.1 eV obtained for the oxygen K-edge transition energies is applied to the calculated ionization potentials. The shifted ionization energies (Table 7.2) shown in parentheses were used in the oxygen K-edge cross section plots.

ThecomputedformicacidoxygenK-shellphotoabsorption/photoionizationcross section of Figure 7.2 top panel shows a peak[194] centered at 532.1 eV which is being attributed to the O(CO) 1s !\u0019\u0003transition, in agreement with other experimen- tal assignments.[194, 204, 206, 207] The second band, centered at 535.1 eV, was previously attributed[206, 207] to the mixture of the O(OH) 1s !\u001b\u0003and\u0019\u0003tran- sitions. However, while TAKAHASHI et al.[193] calculated both transitions at the same energy, in agreement with other experimental assignments,[204, 206, 207] our calculations show a diﬀerence of 1.2 eV and 1.1 eV between the O1s(OH) !\u0019\u0003and the O(OH) 1s!\u001b\u0003transition energies at the SAC-CI and TDDFT levels, respec- tively (see Table 7.1). Nevertheless, experimental results using supersonic beams with resolution[194] ofE \u0001E= 8000have placed the O(OH) 1s !\u0019\u0003transition at 534.8 eV and the O(OH) 1s !\u001b\u0003transition at 535.8 eV, implying an energy dif- ference of 1.0 eV, which is in agreement with our calculations. Above the oxygen 1s ionization potentials it is interesting to observe that the calculated cross section presents a maximum of 2.5 Mb near 541 eV while the experimental curves indicate a maximum of 2.2 Mb at 542 eV followed by a continuum tail,[204] which agrees with our calculation.",

The experiments of TABAYASHI et al.[194] with clustering conditions indicate a blue shift of 0.2 eV for the ﬁrst transition and a red shift, of 0.6 eV, for the second band which is associated to the O(OH) 1s !\u0019\u0003/\u001b\u0003transitions. Evidently, the observed shifts are a consequence of the presence of hydrogens bonds in the clusters, aﬀecting almost equally both transitions. It is important to mention that these last results were obtained in the small cluster beam regime, i.e., for (HCOOH) nclusters, but in the experimental conditions dimers and monomers should be dominant.[194] According to the results presented in Table 7.1 at the TDDFT level, the O(OH) 1s!\u0019\u0003transition is 0.4 eV red shifted and its oscillator strength is noticeably increased in comparison to that of the free formic acid while the O(OH) 1s !\u001b\u0003 transition is 0.5 eV blue shifted but with negligible oscillator strength. The TDDFT calculations for the monomer and dimer are compared in Figure 7.2, bottom panel, where the shifts in the O(CO) 1s !\u0019\u0003and O(OH) 1s!\u0019\u0003/\u001b\u0003transition energies can be clearly seen. The Gaussian broadening of the discrete transitions for the dimer is also shown in Figure 7.2 together with the SAC-CI ionization potentials of Table 7.2, indicated by the vertical dashed lines. It can be seen that the ﬁrst peak is shifted by +0.3 eV while the maximum of the second band is displaced by\u00000.8 eV relative to the monomer. Also, besides the experimental 0.6 eV red shift of the second band, the clustering conditions TIY spectra shows a pronounced broadening of the second band, while almost no broadening of the ﬁrst band is observed. This is consistent with the assignment of the second band to the O(OH) 1s!\u001b\u0003/\u0019\u0003transitions as they involve the donor O atom of the O-H bond and that at clustering conditions condition both the monomer and dimer forms are present, resulting in the broadening of the band with the net displacement of its maximum. Also, a comparison between the continuum region of the spectra show a considerable increase of the cross-section of the dimer relative to that of the monomer as well as relative to the intensities of the O(CO) 1s !\u0019\u0003, and O(OH) 1s!\u001b\u0003/\u0019\u0003bands. These eﬀects, also observed in the TIY experiments,[194, 207] have been attributed by the experimentalists to the formation and fragmentation of multiple charged clusters at higher energies.",

On the oxygen edge, as expected, one observes a more pronounced inﬂuence of the hydrogen bonds in the region below the thresholds, with a\u00000.8 eV red shift of the second band in the dimer. Near the thresholds, the continuum cross section of the dimer increases relative to twice the cross section of the monomer, but decreases faster and becomes practically equal to that of the monomer around 555 eV, where both continuum tails coincide showing that, at high energies, the hydrogen bond inﬂuence on the dimer is small. On the carbon edge, the observed behavior is slightly diﬀerent. Below the C 1s threshold, where the hy- drogen bonds cause no apparent eﬀect on the discrete excitations, the cross section of the dimer becomes equal to twice the monomer. Above the C 1s threshold the comparison of the dimer cross section with twice the cross section of the monomer, shown in the bottom panel of the Figure 7.3, indicates that at energies near the C 1s threshold, at 295.9 eV, the dimer cross section is smaller but becomes larger in the interval 298-306 eV and above this interval both continuum tails of the dimer and monomer coincide. Though our calculated inner-shell cross sections should be better compared with NEXAFS photoabsorption measurements, not presently avail- able, the main features agree well with the TIY[194, 207] experiments at clustering conditions, although some of the experimental observations could be either reinter- preted or complemented by the results of our calculations. As mentioned before, the increase in the continuum intensity was attributed by TABAYASHI et al.[194] to contributions of multiple-charged clusters which would be formed and fragmented at higher energies. However, our calculations show that the sole presence of dimers could well explain the increase in the photoionization cross section near the thresh- oldsandinthecontinuumregionofthespectra. Nevertheless, wecannotruleoutthe contribution of multiple-charged clusters as they were not the object of our study. The experimental results reported in the O 1s edge show reasonable agreement with our calculations and we hope that our results will stimulate NEXAFS experimental work on this system.",
        "We now consider the HCOOH+ 2, HCOHOH+and HCOOH\u0001H3O+cations that could be possibly formed[194, 207] under fragmentation of formic acid dimer struc- tures. These cations present features very diﬀerent from those of the formic acid molecule, as it can be observed in Figure 7.4. In the Table 7.2 we also show the calculated oxygen K-shell ionization potentials. The SAC-CI excitation energies of Table 7.1 show that for the HCOOH+",

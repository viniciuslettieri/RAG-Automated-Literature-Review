Specifically, the extension and co mplexity of supply chains (SCs) have raised many concerns about the level of transparency companies have and the mismatch between actual practices/impacts and what a company communicates. This is particularly important for companies headquartered in emergi ng economies. They face additional barriers to implement sustainability policies and receive less attention from the literature, in comparison to developed countries -based companies. The present study investigates the stakeholder pressures and conditions a t both company and industry -level that influence sustainability reporting focused on SC issues for Brazilian listed companies. The study has analyzed an unbalanced panel data of 220 sustainability reports from 2016 to 2018, representing 88 Brazilian compan ies listed on the national exchange market. It was found that non-governmental organizations devoted to social issues , in addition to shareholder and creditor pressures are significant and positively related to higher levels of SC reporting. In addition, t he adoption of the Global Reporting Initiative ( GRI) methodology and company size are relevant predictors for more information and SC transparency regarding sustainability issues.", "Keyword s: Supply chain transparency; sustainability reporting; Global reporting initiative; stakeholder theory", "LIST OF TABLES", "Table 3: Number of sustainability reports and companies analyzed, by industry and year ..... 31 Table 11: Random panel regression - Huber/White covariance robust matrix method ........... 42", "LIST OF ILUSTRATIONS", "LIST OF ABREVIATIONS", "CSR Corporate Social Responsibility GHG Greenhouse Gas GRI Global Reporting Initiative IBAMA Instituto Brasileiro do Meio Ambiente e dos Recurso s Naturais Renováveis ILO International Labor Organization ISE Índice de Sustentabilidade Empresarial NGO Non-Governmental Organization SC Supply Chain SCM Supply Chain Management SSC Sustainable Supply Chain SSCM Sustainable Supply Chain Management", "CON TENTS", "2.2 STAKEHOLDER THEORY AN D ITS INFLUENCE ON CORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY", "1 INTRODUCTION", "Corporate transparency has become an increasingly important topic on organizational studies, embedded on many contemporary socio -political discourses (Albu & Flyverbom, 2019) ⁠. Problems rel ated to climate change, poverty, human rights, violations, and legal compliance have urged, making companies more aware of their social and environmental impact (Yadava & Sinha, 2016) . In consequence, leaders of their industries are expand ing the boundarie s of supply chain (SC) information reporting (Marshall et al., 2016) . Thus, demands from a diverse range of stakeholders have emerged.", "The growth of environmental and social concerns is translated into the attention that many stakeholders and investors have been paying to how their pressures and investments can contribute to a better (or worse) social welfa re and environmental good , beyond short -term investments returns (Yadava & Sinha, 2016) . Capital ma rket actors are now concerned , not only about short -term profitability, but also about social and environmental impacts that influence cash flows in the long term, such as climate -related topics (Reimsbach et al., 2019) . Topics such as energy consumption (Reimsbach et al., 20 19), along with requirements of environmental and labor regulations ⁠ (Silva & Figueiredo, 2017) , have guided the attention given to sustainability performance . As social media become s a dominant source of information, the “super -transparency” phenomena has amplified the benefits and the risks of doing business (Austin & Upton, 2016) ⁠, which also include social and environmental dimensions (Xu et al., 2019) .", "Recent incidents show that non -compliant behavior often happens beyond the purview of the focal company, along their dispersed SC (Marques, 2019) . Wilhelm et al. (2016) mention some examples of “invisible ” practices that occur along SCs, such as excessive working hours and sexual harassment . Ultimately, this is reflected on the quality and coverage of sustainability reports. Many companies still lack visibility of their SCs in order to manage it properly (Sodhi & Tang, 2019) . This poses a challenge for companies that should track practic es along their SCs avoiding decoupling between practices and communication (Huq & Stevenson, 2018) .", "Considering t he increasing pressure for trustworthy sustainability data and reporting, the importance of international reporting methodologies, such as the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), i ncreases (Islam et al., 2016) . Best practices on sustainability reporting, particularly those aligned with such methodologies, help demonstrat ing to stakeholders that", "“good gove rnance, as well as environmental and social issues are taken into consideration in the management of the supply chain ” (Okongwu et al., 2013 , p. 828). They intend to support companies in communicat ing to their audience how the y are dealing with salient topics related to their SCs’ operations. Given that scenario, the present study explore s the importance of GRI in driving the attention given by sustainability reports to sustainable supply chain (SSC) issues.", "Supply chains in em erging regions face additional barriers to implement innovative and sustainable ways of production (Silvestre, 2015b) . This is particularly important for the present study, as it aims to investigate an emerging country in economic develop ment terms, namely Brazil. In the food global chain, for example, products transit through emerging countries until end -market nations with diverse socioeconomic realities (Gold et al., 2017) . This calls attention to the relevance of the players of the global SCs located in emerging economies .", "To sum up, the present study aims to investigate the stakeholder pressures and conditions that significantly influence the level of reporting covering SC issues for listed companies in Brazil. First of all, GRI Topics for Sectors was accessed to define what are the most critical industries in terms of sustainable supply chain management (SSCM). Next, a quantitative content analysis was made among corporate sustainability reports to check the attention given to SSC matters. Finally, the study checked for correlati ons between several stakeholder pressures and reporting levels. Non-governmental organization ( NGO ) devoted to social issues , creditor and social government pressures were found positive and significant in the present model, in addition to the adoption of GRI and the size of the companies. It is already known that stakeholders do have a role in corporate reporting (Chen & Kitsis, 2017; Meixell & Luoma, 2015; Sodhi & Tang, 2019). However, less is known about what types of stakeholders contribute more to sust ainability reporting in SC issues. Only one study covered in the literature review directly assessed reporting practices focused on SCs (Okongwu et al., 2013). Also, even though the existence of a diverse body of publications on corporate sustainability re porting, much research is concentrated on US -based companies (Tate et al., 2010) and developed countries in general (Kuzey & Uyar, 2017). Thus, there is a lack of knowledge on how reporting covers SC issues in emerging economies (Silvestre, 2015b). The pre sent study aims to fulfill the mentioned gaps.", "In the following sections, the study presents the definition and implications of corporate sustainability reporting practices. Next, stakeholder theory is defined, and how social constituents can influence th e level of SSC reporting in order to enhance businesses’", "reputation and legitimacy. Finally, considerations about SSCM and the risks and impacts on sustainability performance are presented. After this, the method is explained in details, followed by the pr esentation and analysis of findings and their impacts for practitioners and the SSCM literature .", "2 LITERATURE REVIEW 2.1 Corporate Sustainability Reporting", "Information reporting permit s observability, certainty, and accountability (Albu & Flyverbom, 2019) between the companies and their stakeholders, decreasing the information asymmetry between them. Through sustainability repor ting, companies disclose their performance regarding economic, social and environmental issues during a period of time, usually a fiscal year (Dilling & Harris, 2018) . The ultimate goal is to embed sustainability into the business strategy and to develop competitive advantage (Whi tehead, 2017) . Corporate sustainability reports have been employed to cover a broad range of topics, including economic related topics (Wu et al., 2018) , labor practices , communities activities (Fuente et al., 2017) , energy usage , biodiversity (Reimsbach et al., 2019) , among others . This type of reports has been helping companies to create value and legitimize actions in face to stakeholders ’ demands (Fuente et al., 2017) . Also, internally, such reports are a mechanism for management and control, assisting companies to detect and correct poor sustainability performance, im plement policies and review their results (García -Sánchez et al., 2019b) . When companies engage on sustainability reporting, they show commitment to transparency and consequently attract more invest ors and customers, enhancing operational efficiency and so on (Okongwu et al., 2013) .", "An effective and inclusive transparency strategy, bringing together all stakeholder to design sustainability reports, tends to generate several benefits to companies. Many authors stress possi ble outcomes for it, like the decrease of legal and financial risks and the increase of reputational capital and corporate value (Rashidfarokhi et al., 2018) , trust (Albu & Flyverbom, 2019) and employee recruitment and retention (Soundararajan et al., 2019) . Also, investments on social responsibility and responsiveness for transparency demands have a positive impact on company performance (Kang et al., 2016) and keep corporate competitive advantage (Marshall et al., 2016) .", "The definition of businesses practices on integrated reporting is important to understand in what extent companies ar e engaged to increase, maintain or restore the necessary legitimacy to operate in the socio -economic context (Vitolla et al., 2019) . The proactiveness and anticipation towards external stakeholders’ demands has the potential to avoid problems with reduced time for planning, particip ation and experimentation (Marshall", "et al., 2016) and give rise to capabilities needed to respond to col lective coercive pressure from buyers and improve chances of long -term survival (Huq & Stevenson, 2018) . Through stakeholders’ participation processes (Paula & Gil -Lafuente, 2018) , companies in emerging economies can better shape their reporting practices to target what really matters to their salient stakeholders in terms of SC sustainability, and avoid negative reactions from unreliable (or omitted) information.", "Some initiatives to either assure or standardize corporate transparency information and practices, like ISO, UN Global Compact member ship and GRI have been developed, in order to respond to the crescent need to improve su stainability performance from companies (Whitehead, 2017) . GRI guidelines – the framework studied in the present study - has pushed companies to commit themselve s to ethical practices and maintain high standards of public integrity (Islam et al., 2016) . GRI guidelines also have the power to ensure greater credibility and comparability of information (Cubilla -Montilla et al., 2019) , including those related to SSC. In addition, the inclusion of salient topics for different stakeholders reinforce the importance of sustainability reporting (Whitehead, 2017) that follows best practices. A key element to well-shaped reporting strateg ies is how companies engage (or not) with their stakeholders. After conducting a review in the literature, Rashidfarokhi et al. (2018) listed some motivations for companies to report their sustainability information , including the necessity to engage with stakeholders and address society ’s demands. Policies on corporate sustainability include interes ts of many stakeholder groups, like consumers, local communities and the natural environment (Zimon et al., 2019) and allow focal companies to nurture a network with suppliers, distributors, retailers, etc., to develop and manage sustainable business processes (Pohlmann et al., 2020) . Th ose policies also permit the identification of critical aspects when designing, planning and operating SSCs (Dubey et al., 2017) , which assists the formatting of transparency principles.", "The role of the society on pushing companies to sustainability is central to this study. The consideration of stakeholders and their demands on the design of business policies is key to achieve sustaina ble development (Paula & Gil -Lafuente, 2018) . Multinational companies, for example, have pushed their suppliers to comply with la bor codes of conduct and improve work conditions often as a result of pressures by media and activist groups (Bird et al., 2019) ,. Since the subprime crisis of 2008, stakeholders have demanded co mpanies to look forward on long-term value and avoid only short -term earnings (Dilling & Harris, 2018) . Such pressures, particularly in disruptive moments, help to push focal companies to improve their strategies when dealing with sustainability and supply chain management (SCM).", "2.2 Stak eholder Theory and its influence on Corporate Sustainability Reporting", "The manner in which companies report their sustainability performance have been considered by many market and nonmarket stakeholders, ranging from customers to even the United Nations (Marquis et al., 2016) . Beyond internal concerns, external pressure from legislation, peers ’ best practices and important stakeholders like NGOs (Marshall et al., 2016) and institutional investors (Hahn et al., 2015) influenc e the accountability perception and corpor ate behavior regarding sustainability topics. As a consequence, companies should consider stakeholder’s engagement in corporate strategies (Paula & Gil -Lafuente, 2018) . The array that composes the stakeholder scheme may vary depending on the author ’s perspective, either narrower or broader. In this sense, some authors mention market analysts, consultants, media (Paula & Gil -Lafuente, 2018) , academia (Paula & Gil -Lafuente, 2018; Salvia et al., 2019) , natural environment (Miniaoui et al., 2019) , industry or competitors (Salvia et al., 2019; Tate et al., 2010) , community (Tate et al., 2010) and the general society (Hahn et al., 2015; Tate et al., 2010) , besides including the mo st common ones, such as shareholders, customers, employees, governments and NGOs. The management of such complex frame, added to technological, economic and social changes (Paula & Gil -Lafuente, 2018) , have posed a challenge for relationships management and, finally, affected the long - term survival of companies (Vitolla et al., 2019) . This movement is particularly important in emerging countries like Brazil, where prior studies have not accessed such type of institutional background with proper intensity yet (Kuzey & Uyar, 2017) .", "Stakeholder theory allows the expansion of the notion of value creation to beyond shareholders ’ perspective (Soundararajan et al., 2019) . Recently, a movement called lo ng- termism have been established, in response to the unsustainable short -term orientation of past moments (Dilling & Harris, 2018) . When the economic and social scenario changes, shared value creation actions, advocated by the stakeholder theory, may arise as an alternative to generatio n of benefits for all stakeholders, includ ing the owners (Vitolla et al., 2019) . Managers are responsible for promot ing a more complete and strategic response to stakeholder expectations (Whitehead, 2017) , where financial, social, environmental, and governance performance are simultaneously reached (Vitolla et al., 2019) .", "When stakeholders have an active participation on SCM policies, leading companies develop a close relationship with their suppliers to guarantee environmental compliance, enforc ing its social values and adding value in a competitive c ost (Tate et al., 2010) . This", "tends to avoid problems on institutional settings with strong civil society defenders, caused by harming -legitimacy actions (Marquis et al., 2016) . On emerging countries’ context , Silvest re (2015b) states that companies face additional barriers to implement sustainable practices due to the turbulence and uncertainty when compared to developed country -based companies. The author proposes that, in turbulent environments companies would follow a subtler trajectory of sustainability, while companies from more stable environments would reach high levels of sustainability faster. In addition, Barkemeyer et al. (2015) corroborate that idea, in that emerging countries face more acute social and environmental crises, most of which have been through political changes in terms of democratization, liberalization and privatization. Many studies have assessed the influence of stakeholder pressures on sustainability reporting. Overall , all stakeholders, from internal (as employees ) to external (such as NGOs and governments ), have positively influenced SSCM actions. Compa nies which operate in environmentally sensitive industries, for example, face more pressure to provide significant amounts of sustainability information (Miniaoui et al., 2019; Mohammadi et al., 2018) . Customer pressure was also found t o be positively related to the transparency of sustainability reports (Fernandez -Feijoo et al., 2014) and the level of maturity on SSC reporting (Okongwu Through the employment of GRI and quantitative measures - to make sustainability more visible and comprehensive - companies can evaluate how well they are promoting an effective stakeholder communication (Yadava & Sinha, 2016) and adapt to the institutional influences of their context (Cubilla -Montilla et al., 2019) , jointly with the improvement of sustai nability reporting. Given such improvement, it is possible to reduce economic, social, and environmental uncertainties and help analysts generate more accurate forecasts (García - Sánchez et al., 2019a) . This tends to enhance the acknowledge of sustainability performance indicators and consequently decision -making processes related to SSCM.", "2.3 Reporting practices and its impacts on SSCM", "The importance of SCM has b een stablished since the nineties in the business literature (Davis, 1993; Ellram, 1991; Lee & Billington, 1995; Scott & Westbrook, 1991; Tan et al., 1999) . More specifically, the study of SSCM has gained much attention in the last decade (Ansari & Kant, 2017; Jia et al., 2018) . SSCM has em erged with the idea of incorporation and intersection of three spheres – environ mental, social and economic performance – to business management (Ansari & Kant, 2017) . While not considered in competitive strategies before the 1970s, strategies of SSCM has evolved to part of corporate", "competitive advantage (Zimon et al., 2019) . Now, companies that fail to consider, measure and/or control one of three dimensions are more susceptible to become unsustainable and incur in an ambiguous and risky path (Silvestre, 2015a) .", "SSCM literatur e classifies sustainable practices on upstream, focal company, and downstream (Zimon et al., 2019) . Various dimensions may be cited as components of a SSCM, as pointed out by Dubey et al. (2017) : environmental, social and ethical, economic, operational performance, internal and external factors. They influence the way SCs adapt their practices and improve SSCM performance, aligned with best reporting practices. The management of sustainability -related risks has gained much importance for different companies from many industries (Xu et al., 2019) . For example, t he apparel industry is the second -largest polluter, considering problems of post -consumer waste and reverse logistics (Sodhi & Tang, 2019) . Pollutio n is also a recurring problem for the consumer electronic goods in dustry - particularly in emerging regions like China (Wilhelm et al., 2016) - and CO 2 emissions for the food SC (Pohlmann et al., 2020) . Risk management through voluntary reporting of SC information may limit reputational damages for companies and the exposition on the media, NGOs and government agencies even when publishing negative news (Sodhi & Tang, 2019) , particularly in such environmental sensitive industries. Xu et al. (2019) define three steps to evaluate SC sustainability risk : mapping, materiality assessment and its analysis. Mapping process, for example, happens when focal companies initially invest on the visibility of the SC for themselves, through audits and supplier interviews, to improve the level of transparency for stakeholders (Sodhi & Tang, 2019) , acknowledging regional characteristics of the SC (Xu et al., 2019) . Some features should be taken into consideration in this process, such as power asymmetries, which varies between industr ies (Wilhelm et al., 2016) or social issues, which are more challenging in emerging countries (Silvestre, 2015b) , to cite a few .", "In some SCs, environmental sustainability is more prominent, where the choice of suppliers, materials and transport modes affects businesses more decisively. At the sam e time, financial and social performance are more relevant to companies where the assemble of the final product relies on many other companies, like in the automotive and electronic industries (Tate et al., 2010) . While transportati on industry companies focus on environmental themes, services industry tend to focus on social and human capital themes (Wu et al., 2018) . In addition, agricultural companies have been increasingly demanded to improve their sustainability practices (Whitehead, 2017) , including aspects such as the employ ment of modern slavery work ing conditions . This is particularly important in emerging countries,", "which are mostly dependent on rural activit ies, affecting the well -being and social condition of the population of these regions (Gold et al., 2017) .", "Many issues may be cited as consequences of a poor mon itoring routine for SSCM. Silvestre (2015a) list some of them when studied Petrobras ’ operations, a big Brazilian Oil and Gas company, like disturbing local fishing activities, proliferation of favelas, high levels of crime and violence, among others. Sodhi and Tang (2019) recall some scandals in corporations’ history, like a fire in a supplier facility, resulting in a loss of € 4 00M for Ericsson in 2000 ; a layoff of 1,400 workers from an insolvent supplier of Land Rover in 2001 ; and, not forgetting to mention, the Rana Plaza event in 2013 , killing more than one thousand people . Companies involved in such events general ly face various types of problems, such as consumer backlash, product recalls, fines and loss of market share ( Mani et al., 2018) . Through the promotion of SC visibility, companies develop auditing/inspection mechanisms, aiming to “prevent or reduce reputation damages caused by the public exposure of unacceptable supplier practices or undesirable supply provenance ” (Sodhi & Tang, 2019, p. In a perfect scenario, buyer companies would monitor all the upstream suppliers to guarante e a transparent SC. However, the distance commonly encountered in these chains make collaborative technologies and monitoring difficult to be applied efficiently (Wilhelm et al., 2016) . In these cases, leading companies have limited enforcement to mak e suppliers act accordingly to their sustainability standards. Wilhelm et al. (2016) support this idea stressing the important role played by first -tier suppliers, that act like interlocutors between the buyi ng company and second -tier suppliers. Still on suppliers management, Huq and Stevenson (2018) point out the importance o f suppliers selection and development for the management of social indicators as the diffusion of responsibility comes to light, when isolated actions from different constituents are viewed as part of just one single body (Eriksson & Svensson, 2016) . When companies have operational realities in their SCs, detached from what they commu nicate, the phenomenon of greenwashing takes place, according to the literature (Gold et al., 2017) . In such cases, SC actors define standards to follow, but not necessarily put effort to seek for them (Soundararajan et al., 2019) , lacking the capacity of enforcement. This has become particularly risky for businesses, as disruptions in both upstream and downstream levels, caused by a poor visibility, are now crucial to avoid negative impacts on sales (Sodhi In order t o implement a more effective SSCM, it is important to focus on solutions to measure, track and improve results along the time. Companies’ internal and external", "stakeholders should be able to interpret sustainability information and make decisions, evaluating companies and driving improvements (Barkemeyer et al., 2015) . However, in practice, companie s have failed to provide not only quantified but also qualitative assessments of their social and environmental performance (Rashidfarokhi et al., 2018) . Very few companies provide any information about suppliers beyond their ﬁrst tier (Sodhi & Tang, This directly affects the access of data from researchers (Jia et al., 2018) , limiting the quantity of studies related to sustainability issues in SCs and the influence of stakeho lders on SC reporting . GRI for example presents a gap on presenting SC assessments. While analyzing the mining industry, Mancini and Sala (2018) found that some health and safety aspects in mining communities are not included in the G4 guideli nes (active version at that moment); same case for impacts of poor working conditions and inflation and rising costs for accommodations, which are indirectly or partially treated by GRI (Mancini & Sala, 2018) . It becomes clear the importance given to the SSC, but difficult to evaluate the effectiveness of direct reporting approaches like GRI (Meckenstock et al., 2016) . The tru th is that they have limited potential to provide a real pictur e of lower -tiers realities to salient stakeholders, despite all the efforts employed.", "Additionally, it is recurrent the major interest given by scholars to developed -country cases when studying SCs (Jia et al., 2018; Kuzey & Uyar, 2017; Silvestre, 2015a) . Silvestre (2015 a) points out the differences encountered in emerging environments, like the regulatory frame and social pressures, and the role of focal companies based on such regions, which possibly has notable distinctions. As a result , the literature on SSCM still h as a long way to evolve in such questions (Dubey et al., 2017) . Because of that, the present study aims to target this gap in the literature, by investigating different i ndustries inserted in the Brazilian economy. In Table 1 it is presented some of the studies which have influenced the current investigation.", "21 Huang and Kung (2010) Environmental disclosure level External, internal and intermediary stakeholders All stakeholders were posit ively related to environmental disclosure, except for suppliers Okongwu et al. (2013) Level of maturity on SSC reporting Type of industry (B2B, B2C, polluting industry or not) Discl osure maturity level is higher in business -to-consumer industries than in business -to-business industries on both social and environmental dimensions.

The majority has found a positive relation between sustainability reporting and stakeholder pressures , including customers (Okongwu et al., 2013; Vitolla et al., 2019) , investors (Chithambo et al., 2020; Fernandez - Feijoo et al., 2014; Vitolla et al., 2019) , emp loyees (Fernandez -Feijoo et al., 2014; Vitolla et al., 2019) and so on . Exceptions ar e rare, like in the example of Chithambo et al. (2020) , which found a negative relationship between GHG emission disclosure and creditor s pressure.

Indeed, the mentioned authors found in their study that higher levels of environmental disclosure were positively related to fines paid due to violations of environmental legislation.

NGOs and Public Agenc ies, for example, were excluded as their constituents are not for -profit organizations, a dissimilar type of business compared to the other companies. The other missing cases were mainly due to the absence of reporting. After that, an analysis was made to match the remaining 25 industries from GRI Topics for Sectors (2013) classification with the industry classifi cation adopted by the Brazilian Stock exchange. The procedure was made through the description of economic activities. This resulted in a potential sample of 275 listed companies.", "After excluding companies with no sustainability reports or reports without comprehensive SSC information, the final sample was composed by 220 reports.

The obligation for companies to report their environmental and social performance is not applied for the Brazilian reality, as sustainab ility reporting is not enforced by law – they are mainly done in voluntary basis. Because of that, some alternative measures were defined to evaluate the enforcement of the regulation on companies. On EnvGov pressure, for example, a binary code was applied due to the dispersion of data – some companies w ere penalized with high amounts of fines while others have never been p unished . Also, the inclusion of a social perspective to the NGO pressure was considered relevant to be included in the investigation, as most of the studies just operationalize this specific stakeholder pressure on environmental sensitive industries.", "4 FINDINGS The descriptive statistics for the variables included in the model are presented in Table", "Table 5. Descriptive statistics of var iables", "Regarding Customer pressures , the median is 0.5, meaning that half of the companies are from industries that are close to the final customer.

In addition, most of companies did not receive any fine from IBAMA during the period searched - expressed by EnvGov pressure , which presented a median of zero with a mean close to the same numb er. Such finding may contradict the fact that most companies are classified as members of environmental sensitive industries. This leads to two possible interpretations : either companies have followed environmental regulations or the monitoring/execution o f fines have not been properly applied.", "Regarding Creditor pressures, some companies presented negative values. This is due to losses on net income for specific companies and years. Results from shareholder variable shows that, in general, companies are n ot involved in Brazilian voluntary best practices on sustainability reporting – 67 out of 88 companies did not join the ISE initiative in any of the years analyzed.

On the positive side, industries such as Food and Beverage Processing, Forest and Paper Products and Telecommunicatio n Services have dedicated above -average attention to SC issues in their sustainability reports (82%, 75% and 84% of reports classified into the first two quartiles respectively) . Food and Beverage Processing industry, for example, was considered to present customer and both NGO pressures. This means that the industry is close to the end customer, added to the fact that is one of the industries that had the most modern slavery people rescued during the 2016 -2018 period as described in Table 4 . Also, it is considered to perform an environmental sensitive economic activity. Here, it can be said that the industry has responded to stakeholder pressures accordingly.", "Same NGO pressures are encountered in the Forest and Paper Products Industry. The industry has prob lems with intensive modern slavery labor and it is an environmental", "sensitivity activity as described in Table 4 . Despite this fact, 75% of its reports – from five different companies – are positioned at the first two quartiles. It can be concluded that th e industry has accomplished stakeholder demands in terms of level of information of their SC. However, it is also plausible to believe that the reporting practices of such companies have not covered the most salient topics of their activities. Companies ma y engage on selective reporting and disclosure only “good news” (Sodhi & Tang, 2019) , not changi ng critical sustainability issues along SCs. A qualitative content analysis of sustainability reports can better evaluate what argument is valid.", "On the negative side, industries such as Oil and Gas and Educational Services presented poor performance regar ding SCmentions (71% and 88% of reports classified on the last two quartiles, respectively ). This is not in line with the environmental sensitive status and the high union membership rate (the highest among all industries) related to these industries, respectively. Then, it can be said that at least one of the stakeholders analyzed here, namely EnvNGO and Employee, has either been neglected in corporate reports or not exerting its power to improve SC reporting levels among companies from such industries. In order to complement the results found in the investigation of SC reporting levels, Table 7 shows the top and bottom -10 companies in terms of volume of SC reporting. It can be noticed that there is not any industry that concentrates top or bottom companies in terms of SC reporting.

Top and Bottom -10 companies on SC reporting score , per industry", "This may indicate that there is a significant variability within the same industries regarding the attention given to SC issues. Such fact makes difficult to predict general corporate behavior in terms of SC reporting in Brazil. The absence of enforcement to sustainability reporting can lead to this heterogeneity. Companies seem to voluntary engage on SC sustainability reporting by their own efforts, seeking for differentiation (García -", "Sánchez et al., 2019a) and, consequently, competitive advantage. Other factors to be considered are size and membership on initiatives like GRI and ISE. This is going to be explored during the m ultiple regression analysis. Following, in order to run the regression model with no problems of multicollinearity , a Spearman c orrelation matrix is presented, with the respective correlations and significances among dependent, independent and control var iables (Table 8 and Table 9).", "Multicollinearity occurs when independent variables have a significant correlation higher than +/ - 0.7.

As the former presented a less significant relationship with the dependent vari able SCmentions, it was dropped from the equation. In conclusion, Hypothesis 2 could not be verified in this study.

Public and potential customer value transparency (Hahn et al. , 2015) . Because of that, it is important that companies fulfill their expectations on SC reporting in order to avoid boycotts and bad publicity.", "On the other side, s upplier s per se are not motivated to tackle the growing interest of end customers to sus tainability issues. Among German third -part logistic companies (Maas et al., 2018) and first -tier suppliers in Germany and Aust ria (Foerstl et al., 2015) , pressure from direct clients, i.e., contractors, were perceived as more relevant, due to its proximity to them. In such cases, the importance of policies to effectively implement sustainability actions along SCs gains importance. However, among Brazilian companies which are close to their clients, it could not be possible to show their commitment to report SC information (H1 not accepted ). One of the reasons is that they might been failing to communicate to lower -tier suppliers the urgency of sustainability issues to the final customers.", "Pressure from the government is also generally considered in stakeholder and SSCM literature. Implementation of sustainability actions depends on public investment and efforts done by the multi -stakeholder a rena, including national, regional and local governments (Salvia et al., 2019) . Regarding this, Xu et al. (2019, p. 859) state that “local socioeconomic conditions largely determine the social risk of a supply chain”. Particularly in this study, the attempt was to reflect the reality of Brazi l in social issues through the evaluation of effectiveness of public monitoring agencies. In a preliminary finding, from the correlation matrix on Table 9, it was indicated that industries which incurred in more violations of the labor regulation have dedi cated more information about SC issues in their reports. However, when added to the multiple regression model, this hypothesis was not confirmed (H7 not accepted ).", "Kang et al. (2016) found that companies engage on CSR in response to poor SSCM on past events. The same was evidenced by Huq and Stevenson (2018) , which discovered that garment factories in Bangladesh have banned child labor and some uns ustainable practices after the Rana Plaza disaster. Differently from these evidences, Brazilian listed companies that have violated labor law do not seem to be willing to improve their sustainability practices", "and, in an ultimate case, SC reporting levels. In the correlation matrix presented on Table 9, it was found a moderate positive correlation between SocGov and SCmentions. But, when added to the random panel regression, the relationship was not significant.", "Same conclusion can be done for EnvGov and Em ployee pressures. It could not be possible to demonstrate that the estimates are statistically different than zero. In conclusion, H6 and H8 were also not confirmed . For employee pressure, for example, it was found that German third -party logistic companie s have perceived internal stakeholders, such as employees, as the most influential driver for environmental practice adoption (Maas et al., 2018) . However, in a different context like the one encountered in Brazil, the results were different. Perhaps these stakeholders have not perceived the value of good SSCM practices yet, including reporting and transparency on SCs’ realities.", "Poor social performance on SCs may have a negative impact on the marketplace and society (Eriksson & Svensson, 2016) . Private companies and governments from rich countries are importing “at -risk” products in an enormous scale – estimations are that this number is around US$ 354 billion annually for the top -5 products exported from each exporting country (The Mindero o Foundation, 2018) . This promotes the tenacity of unsustainable practices among SCs. Hopefully, companies that have been pressured by NGOs committed to social causes in Brazil have reported more information about their SC (H3 accepted) . This helps the achievement of social expectations regarding sustainability transparency on SCs (Islam et al., 2016) . However, this initiative is not enough. Companies should go beyond SC reporting, and should implement real changes in SSCM practices, promoting what is called “sustainability as practice ” (Silva & Figueiredo, 2017) to address rooted social unsustainable practices along entire SCs.", "Strong pressure from shareholders contribu tes to long -term performance on SSCM (Rebs et al., 2019) . The same can be translated into best reporting practices. Shareholder pressure was positively related to vol untary sustainability disclosure among 130 listed German companies (Gamerschlag et al., 2011) . Also, integrated reporting quality, considering aspects lik e assurance, content and form, was positively influenced by higher levels of shareholder pressure (Vitolla et al., 2019) . It can be concluded that shareholders, particularly those who invest their money on members of ISE, have an active voice on shaping corporate sustainability repo rting practices in Brazil, including SC -related issues (H4 accepted) . Pressure from creditors are also found in the literature as a driver to SSCM and sustainability reporting practices. Kalu et al. (2016) , for example, found a positive relationship between voluntary carbon disclosure and creditor pressure among Malaysian real", "state companies. Yunus et al. (2020) found that the perceived influence of creditors among listed Australian companies drives carbon management strategies. Sustainability practices improve economic performance (Chen & Kitsis, 2017) , a sensitive topic to debtholders. Because of that, when manager ial decisions include environmental and social dimensions, economic goals and sustainability performance are simultaneously met. Brazilian financing companies seemed to understand such logic (H5 accepted) .", "Sustainability reports developed in GRI basis allo w companies to identify concerns on environmental and social management and to ensure a proper communication with internal and external stakeholders (García -Sánchez et al., 2019b) . Adjustments on re ports considering such stakeholder demands, through the promotion of a set of core indicators (Barkemeyer et al., 2015) empower corporate transparency practices and promote a productive dialogue about environmental and social governance (Grushina, 2017) . These facts give hope to a higher attention to SC matters from focal companies, what was indeed confirmed for the Brazilian reality, considering the sampled companies that adopted GRI as framework to develop th eir sustainability reports (H9 accepted) .", "Finally, size, measured by the natural log of total employees, was also positively correlated with better performance on SCmentions. This is in line with Gamerschlag et al. (2011) findings, while investigating the drivers for CSR disclosure. Same positive correlation was found by Chithambo et al. (2020) and Kalu et al. (2016) for carbon disclosure, but now considering number of assets as a proxy. The availa bility of resources may explain these evidences. The preparation and auditing of sustainability reports, along with the implementation of standards such as GRI, require the use of human and financial resources that, in most of the times, is not available f or smaller companies (Svensson et al., 2018) .", "6 CONCLUSION", "The growing interest on sustainability topics have shaped many corporate practices in the recent years. This movement has put pressure on companies to communicate their performance regarding environmental and social issues. This is particularly important for SSCM, as it is known that many incidents have occurred beyond focal companies ’ borders. Companies have a shared responsibility on what happens along their SCs, being in charge of reporting relevant events to stakeholders.", "The presented study aimed to assess what stakeholder pressures influence higher levels of SC reporting among Brazilian listed companies. After a random effects modeling, employed on longitudinal data that comprised the years of 2016, 2017 and 2018, it was found that social NGO, shareholder and creditor pressures were significant and positively correlated with more SC reporting. Industries that had major numbers of people rescued from modern - slavery working conditions tended to report more information on SC sustainability - probably, most of it is related to social performance. This evidences that companies are prone to disclosure more SC information as they are scrutinized by past events that might damage their reputation.", "For creditor pressure, there are evidences that lenders have interest on not only financial but also environmental and social performance issues. The use of long -term debt amount as a proxy for creditor p ressure was due to the commitment of such stakeholders to the long -term value created and maintained by companies through time. Environmental and social performance are now seen as risks embedded on the overall corporate risk management equation. In result , high risks related to these areas may, ultimately, influence the availability of financial resources and raise the costs of capital for companies in Brazil. GRI reporting and the membership on ISE were also positively related to SC reporting. Companies w hich apply best practices and make efforts on differentiate themselves in monitoring SC practices may obtain several benefits, such as brand recognition, better operational and financial performance and so on. Additionally, size was found to be a relevant predictor for higher levels of SC reporting. This may be explained by additional costs associated to the implementation of a monitoring routine of SC performance. Larger companies have better resources and capabilities that allow them to track their SCs. T his helps to reinforce their leadership against smaller companies, which face additional barriers to implement SC reporting practices.", "6.1 Managerial contributions", "In terms of managerial impacts, the study aimed to recognize which factors have raised the imp ortance for SC reporting. Pressures from NGOs which monitor social issues, such as modern slavery work, and investors, either stock and long -term debtholders, have been indicated as relevant stakeholders to be considered in emerging contexts like the Brazi lian one. Consequently, the acknowledge of such stakeholders in sustainability reports, assessing sensitive topics to them, becomes key to companies ’ management . Surveys and materiality matrices are possible alternatives to assess key stakeholders ’ prefere nces and enable the design of better -shaped sustainability reports.", "The absence of a systematic movement towards SC reporting in Brazil create s opportunities for managers and report -makers to implement a more serious routine o n sustainability performance monitoring and communication. In sectors such as Banks, Oil and Gas and Retailing, where it is possible to notice companies with either top and poor performances on SC reporting (see Table 7) , companies can develop a strategic plan of action to establish a leadership regarding sustainability reporting and differentiate themselves from players of their sectors . For Banks and Financial Services, for example, the implementation of more robust reports seems particularly important , as long-term creditors and sha reholders were indicated as influential stakeholders to push companies in Brazil towards higher levels of SC information disclosure.", "Also, for organizations such as GRI, that advocates best practices on sustainability reporting, the present study aims to bring up an overview of the status quo regarding sustainability reporting on SC performance in Brazil. There are evidences that the attention given to SC issues is not institutionalized among Brazilian companies. Moreover, some sectors su ch as Oil and Gas a nd Ground Transportation, even though having a significant impact on the environment al and the society, have neglected the realities on their lower tiers, compared to other sectors (see Table 6) . In conclusion, there is a need to improve reporting practice s in order to respond to the crescent demand for more responsible SSCM, exerted with more intensity by NGO devoted to social issues, share and debtholders.", "6.2 Theoretical Contributions", "From an academic perspective, the study advances in the sustainability re porting literature by analyzing a different context from those previously studied by the majority of", "papers. The analysis of stakeholder pressures from emerging economies allows to expand the knowledge on SC reporting and SSCM. It also permits a better und erstanding on what level stakeholders drive (or not) companies to achieve higher levels of SC reporting in multiple contexts.", "Moreover, it was found a gap regarding studies that deal with SC reporting. Only one study , from the literature reviewed, investig ated SC reporting issues (Okongwu et al., 2013) . Given such evidence, the present study advances on understanding sustainability performance of not only focal companies but also their suppliers. This is particularly important as many incidents and scandals are originated from l ower -tier suppliers, most of the times “invisible” for the final customer and the society as a whole.", "6.3 Limitations and Future Research", "The employment o f quantitative instead of qualitative content analysis does not allow for a more sensitive analysis regar ding SC information published on the sustainability reports. The volume of mentions to SC issues does not guarantee that a minimum level of quality on reporting is met. In consequence, it is not possible to assess if companies are using their sustainabilit y reports as a marketing tool or they are really engaged to monitor and measure economic, environmental and social performance responsibly. The fact that GRI, employed by the majority of the sample, is auto -declared opens up opportunit ies for opaque report ing. It is recommended, for future investigations, to analyze not only how much but what Brazilian companies are reporting as SC information.", "The scarcity of studies on emerging economies brings an opportunity to the present study to compare the Brazilian results with the ones encountered on studies with developed - economy based companies . However, this same scarcity makes difficult to define the most appropriate proxies to measure stakeholder pressures and their relationship with SC reporting . Those related to regulation , for example, were particularly difficult to be set, due to the absence of systematic enforcement for companies to release sustainability reports in Brazil. Media coverage can be a possible alternative to measure such pressures in a more agg regated Finally, the absence of non -listed companies in the sample is explained by the lack of information easily available. It is known that the majority of companies in Brazil is composed by small and medium companies. Because of that, the present s tudy does not assess the entire", "scenario of SC reporting in the country. Case studies and more in -depth documentation analysis may tackle such limitation.", "APPENDICES", "APPENDIX A", "Lagrange Multiplier Test for effects on panel data", "APPENDIX B", "Hausman Test for Random/Fixed effects on panel data", "APPENDIX C", "Breusch -Pagan Test for Homocedasticity", "APPENDIX D", "Breusch -Godfrey Test for Autocorrelation in orders 1 and 2"]}

ABSTRACT RAMPs (Receptor activity-modifying proteins) are a class of single transmembrane accessory proteins that interact and modulate the activity of several G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), a seven transmembrane domains protein class. By associating themselves with this class of receptors (e.g. calcitonin receptor - CT-R), the three known RAMPs influence their function. According to the RAMP isoform, the heteromeric complex CT-R:RAMP can form three distinct subtypes of amylin receptors (AMY) for the pancreatic hormone amylin. To date, this receptor is the only known cellular receptor for Amylin, which is involved in several metabolic pathways along with insulin and glucagon in the control of carbohydrates metabolism.", "The extracellular topological domains (ETD) of RAMPs and CT-Rs used were cloned into pET28b and successful heterologous expression of proteins was achieved.", "Alternatively to cellular studies, where complete control over the parameters affecting the interactions between ligands and membrane receptors is in many ways unachievable, in this study was used a completely different approach by the use of a broad range of biochemical/biophysical tools to directly assess the interactions between the different entities involved in this interactome. The usage of protein crosslinking in solution, Electron- spray ionization–ion mobility spectrometry–mass spectrometry (ESI–IMS–MS), Small- Angle X-Ray Scattering (SAXS) and Isothermal binding assays with fluorescein-labeled (FITC) proteins revealed the oligomeric nature of RAMPs and Amylin in solution and deepen insights about their interactions, as well as the molecular affinities with CT-Rs. Isothermal binding assay with fluorescein-labeled amylin showed a nanomolar affinity between RAMP and amylin. These data suggests that RAMPs might be a direct molecular binding partner with the hormone amylin, playing a more important role than previously expected.", "RESUMO PORTUGUÊS As RAMPs (Proteínas Modificadoras da Atividade de Receptores ) são proteínas acessórias transmembranosas de passagem unica que funcionam em conjunto com diferentes membros de proteínas da classe dos Receptores Acoplados a Proteínas-G (GPCRs), que apresentam uma estrutura comum com um domínio extracelular amino- terminal, sete domínios transmembranosos, três alças extracelulares e três alças intracelulares, e um domínio intracelular carboxi-terminal..

relationship with Amylin", "Diabetes Mellitus (DM) comprises a group of diseases, clinically and genetically heterogeneous, that have common characteristics (elevated levels of glucose, disturbances in the metabolism of carbohydrates, fats, proteins and impaired production and/or action of insulin).", "DM is presented with characteristic symptoms, such as polyuria, obscure vision, glycosuria and difficulty in healing. In its most severe form, ketoacidosis can be developed, which can cause mental confusion, coma and in untreated cases, death. Long-term effects of DM include various complications (BROWNLEE, 2001) in close relationship with the control of blood glucose levels.", "The DM cases can be divided into four groups and dozens of subgroups (AMERICAN DIABETES ASSOCIATION, 2014) as shown in the Table 1.", "Classically, there are two types of diabetes more representative (accounting for more than 95% of the cases), which are:", "- Type 1 diabetes (Immune-mediated diabetes) This form of diabetes, which accounts for only ~5–10% of those with diabetes, previously encompassed by the terms insulin-dependent diabetes, type I diabetes, or juvenile-onset diabetes, results from a cellular-mediated autoimmune destruction of the ß-cells of the pancreas, usually leading to absolute insulin deficiency); - Type 2 diabetes (ranging from predominantly insulin resistance with relative insulin deficiency to predominantly an insulin secretory defect with insulin resistance). This form of diabetes, which accounts for ~90 –95% of those with diabetes, has been previously referred as non-insulin-dependent diabetes, type II diabetes, or adult- onset diabetes, encompasses individuals who have insulin resistance and usually have relative (rather than absolute) insulin deficiency.

Gestational diabetes mellitus Patients with any form of diabetes may require insulin treatment at some stage of their disease. Such use of insulin does not, ofitself, classify the patient. The current concept of diabetes as a multi-hormonal disease, arose from the 2 Table 1: Etiologic classification of diabetes mellitus (adapted from AMERICAN DIABETES ASSOCIATION report, 2014) complexity of the mechanisms that regulate glucose levels. Recent studies have shown the involvement of several hormones (e.g. Insulin, Glucagon, GLP1 and Amylin) and complex regulatory mechanisms, which makes it clear that even an intensive therapy with insulin is insufficient to control the glucose (EDELMAN, 2008) .", "1.2 Amylin", "Amylin, also termed islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP) or diabetes associated peptide (DAP), is a 37 amino acid peptide, synthesized and co-secreted with insulin from pancreatic β-cells following nutrient ingestion, acting to inhibit gastric emptying, feeding and insulin-stimulated glycogen synthesis.", "Amylin was initially discovered and characterized in 1987 as a component of amyloid 3Figure 1: State of the art high-resolution (NMR or crystallographic) structures involving Amylin. Structures available at the RCSB Protein Data Bank ( http://www.rcsb.org). fibrils in the pancreas of type 2 diabetic patients by two independent research groups (COOPER et al., 1987; WESTERMARK et al., 1987) and in some way there is still plenty to be unraveled, particularly the molecular mechanisms and interactomes underlying all the molecular entities directly or indirectly involved in the actions attributed to amylin.", "Amylin belongs to the Calcitonin (CT) peptide family, comprising CT, Calcitonin gene- related peptides (CGRP α and β), Adrenomedullin (AM), Intermedin (IMD; also known as AM2) and three Calcitonin receptor-stimulating peptides (CRSP-1,2,3). All these peptides contain a N-terminal six or seven amino acid cyclic structure, formed by a disulfide bridge that is required for their biological activity (Fig. 1 - detailed structural information can be retrieved using the RCSB Protein Data Bank using access codes: 2L86, 3G7V, 2KJ7, 2G48, 2KB8). In amylin this cyclic structure involves Cys2 and Cys7. Amylin shares ~20% sequence identity with human CT and AM, and 43-56% identity with the CGRPs (Fig. 2).", "Amylin is important in controlling the release rate of glucose derived from ingestion of a meal. It also inhibits the production/release of postprandial liver glucose, inhibiting the secretion of somatostatin and postprandial glucagon secretion, reducing glucose production by the liver (COOPER et al., 1989; JOHNSON et al., 1992; YOUNG, 1994). In some studies, the activation of the Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system has been described for this hormone (COOPER et al., 1995; WOOKEY et al., 1996) . In parallel with the feeling of satiety, amylin also produces increased thirst sensation, 4Figure 2: Calcitonin-related peptides alignment. Amino acid sequences were obtained from UNIPROT, and alignment was performed using Geneious 4.8.5 (Biomatters). Two cysteines are conserved across all the peptides are responsible for an intramolecular disulphide bond that is very important for the structure adopted by these peptides.", "which is an indication of its action in the central nervous system (ARNELO et al., 1996; LUTZ et al., 1998a, 1998b; RIEDIGER et al., 1999) . Since its discovery, amylin has been characterized as the third pancreatic hormone active on glucose homeostasis (STEINER et al., 2002) (JAIKARAN et al., 2001) being currently classified as a potent neuroendocrine hormone and its complementary and synergistic role is important for the action of insulin in the regulation of metabolism of carbohydrates (EDELMAN, 2008) . Even though its importance, therapeutic interest and application is still in a very early stage of development, being its intrinsic propensity to aggregate and form amyloid fibers, one of the major obstacles. The effects of amylin on glucose metabolism and food intake have been extensively studied and characterized (as systematized in Figure 3). They are mediated by peripheral and central mechanisms (YOUNG, 2005a) .", "Amylin and insulin after being produced in the pancreatic beta cells, are co-secreted in a constant molar ratio of approximately 1:20 (MARTIN, 2006) and plasma insulin and amylin concentrations follow a similar pattern after meal intake (KRUGER; GATCOMB; OWEN, 1999) . In healthy fasting adults amylin circulates at 5Figure 3 - Schematic model of glucose regulation, highlighting the physiological roles of amylin and integrating with those of insulin and glucagon. Adapted from (KRUGER; GATCOMB; OWEN, concentrations of 4-8 pM and after meals, amylin concentrations can increase up to 15-25pM (KRUGER; GATCOMB; OWEN, 1999) . Insulin secretion after a meal stimulates the peripheral tissues to take up circulating glucose with a concurrent increase in amylin secretion that acts to suppress glucagon secretion from the pancreatic β-cells, which in turn suppresses the mobilization of glucose from liver glycogen stores. Amylin also potently slows gastric motility, decreasing nutrient delivery to the small intestine thereby delaying absorption of glucose into circulation. In addition, amylin mediates signals of satiety to the CNS (MARTIN, 2006; YOUNG, 2005a). Amylin is an important part of the multi-hormonal regulation of glucose homeostasis. In type 1 diabetic patients (Insulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus; IDDM), there is an absolute deficiency in insulin and amylin, whereas in late stage non- insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) or type 2 diabetes there is a relative deficiency of insulin accompanied by a relative deficiency of amylin (MARTIN, 2006). In diabetic patients failure to suppress glucagon secretion after meal intake, even when administered with exogenous insulin, results in a continuous increase in plasma glucose levels from glycogenolysis in the postprandial period, attributed to the lack of insulin’s “partner hormone” amylin (MARTIN, 2006) . SYMLIN® (pramlintide acetate) was approved by the United States FDA in March 2005 as an adjunct therapy for type 1 and 2 diabetic patients, who use mealtime insulin therapy and have failed to achieve desired glucose control despite optimal insulin therapy. Pramlintide is an injectable amylin analogue developed by substituting amino acids in the amyloidogenic native human amylin (25Ala, 28Ser and 29Ser) with corresponding prolines in the non-amyloidogenic rat amylin, and 10G ln for Asn (Figure 2) (YOUNG, 2005b). With that modifications, Pramlintide presents a higher solubility in a variety of buffered solutions (KENLEY et al., 2000; MCQUEEN, 2005; YOUNG et al., 1996) . Despite the enhanced solubility of the proline-rich variants, evidences have been found elsewhere that such human amylin analog peptides are prone to assembly into amyloid fibrils. Segments 8–20 and 14–20 of human amylin are able to form amyloid fibrils (GILEAD; WOLFENSON; GAZIT, 2006; JAIKARAN et al., 2001) . Also, it has been found that the equivalent segment of murine amylin spanning amino acids 8–20 (differing from human amylin solely by the His 18) also forms amyloid fibrils (JAIKARAN et al., 2001) . A peptide comprising the region 30–37, which share the same sequence in both human and murine amylin, also can be structured into amyloid fibrils (NILSSON; RALEIGH, 1999) . Single-point mutation in the murine amylin sequence enhances the propensity for amyloid formation in murine amylin (GREEN et al., 2003) . In fact, murine amylin has been found to form amyloid fibrils under very particular circumstances, by dissolving lyophilized amylin directly with Tris–HCl buffer pH 7.4, while attempts to dissolve with water or phosphate buffered saline did not result into amyloid fibrils (MILTON; HARRIS, 2013a) . Moreover, formation of murine amylin amyloid assemblies has been reported with discretion in the literature (GREEN et al., 2003; PALMIERI et al., 2013b) , and so far these data have not received much attention.", "The collected evidences concerning amyloid fibrils formation from murine amylin fragments have been indicative that murine amylin can in fact perform homoassociation, resulting in the assembly of high order oligomers (as shown in the present thesis) that ultimately could result in the formation of amyloid fibrils (PALMIERI et al., 2013b) . However, the lack of experimental evidences for such intermediates and the lack of detection of amyloid deposits in rodent ( in vivo) has been used as an excluding criteria in the assignment of murine amylin as an amyloidogenic peptide.", "1.3 Amylin Receptor (AMY)", "1.3.1 Discovery", "The enigma surrounding the molecular nature of amylin receptors was solved in 1998 following the discovery of RAMPs (MCLATCHIE et al., 1998).", "Before the discovery of amylin receptors, CGRP and CT peptides were known to have abounding binding sites in the Central Nervous system (CNS) and these sites were anatomically distinct in most regions. Evidence for a new class of salmon Calcitonin (sCT) sensitive CGRP receptors came in 1988 when Sexton and colleagues identified a binding site in rat brain with high affinity for two biochemically distinct peptides (SEXTON; MCKENZIE; MENDELSOHN, 1988) . These were in the first place called C3 binding sites. These sites were first characterized in rat nucleus accumbens, and were later shown to be high affinity amylin binding sites (BEAUMONT et al., 1993) .", "In the same study, amylin was nearly 3-fold more potent than rat β-CGRP, 14-fold more potent than rat α-CGRP, and at least 300-fold more potent than rat calcitonin in affinity for these sites. This selectivity profile markedly differed from the profile of either the CGRP1 or CGRP2 receptor subtype (BEAUMONT et al., 1993) .", "The distribution of amylin binding sites was mapped in detail the following year in the rat brain (SEXTON et al., 1994a) and later in monkey brain (PAXINOS et al., 2004) . The high affinity amylin binding site displayed a distinctive pharmacology, not similar to any of the previously characterized CT or CGRP receptors, with a high affinity for sCT and somewhat lower affinity for CGRP (BEAUMONT et al., 1993; SEXTON et Nevertheless, early evidence for potential heterogeneity in amylin binding sites was provided through differential sensitivity to CGRP, of amylin binding to rat brain sections (VAN ROSSUM; HANISCH; QUIRION, 1997) . High affinity amylin binding sites were also identified in kidney (CHAI et al., 1998; WOOKEY et al., 1996) (Chai et al. 1998; Wookey et al. 1996) and in skeletal muscle (ALBRANDT et al., 1995b; PITTNER et al., 1994) and in a growing number of cell lines such as MCF‐7 human breast carcinoma cells (CHEN et al., 1997; ZIMMERMANN et al., 1997) , mouse TSH thyrotroph cells (HANNA et al., 1995; PERRY et al., 1997a) . The highest density of amylin‐specific binding sites, was described later in the nucleus accumbens and area postrema regions of the brain (YOUNG, 2005c) .", "Along the literature on amylin and its binding sites (and associated potency), inconsistent results can be found because of the complexity exhibited by this signaling system, different cellular backgrounds, extensive alternative splicing exhibited by the CT-R among other factors. These data implied a link between expression of CT receptors and specific cellular backgrounds for the generation of amylin receptor phenotypes. The enigma surrounding the molecular nature of amylin receptors was solved only after the discovery of RAMPs. Following the discovery of RAMPs, most of the previous observations could be reconciled with the different endogenous background levels of RAMPs expressed in the cells (JUST et al., Although a larger number of theoretical possibilities are known to exist, t he current IUPHAR (The International Union of Basic and Clinical Pharmacology - http://www.iuphar.org/ ) consensus is that there are three amylin receptors (AMY1−3R) generated by the interaction of the CT-R with RAMPs 1–3, respectively (POYNER et al., 2002) .", "1.3.2 Molecular Identity of Amylin Receptors (AMY)", "Amylin, as a member of the calcitonin (CT) family of peptides, also shares receptors from the same family and relatively similar mechanisms of recognition. The receptors 9Figure 4 - Complex formation between the (CT-R) and RAMPs in the endoplasmic reticulum. All three RAMPs are capable of existing as homodimers in the ER, however in the presence of CT-R an equilibrium is established in which, heteromers between the receptor and each of the RAMPs, are formed. Adapted from (HAY; DICKERSON, 2010, p. 47) for these peptides (Calcitonin family) comprise the Calcitonin receptor (CT-R) and the Calcitonin Receptor-like receptor (CRLR) that may be complexed with one of three Receptor activity-modifying proteins (RAMPs) (TILAKARATNE et al., 2000) . Expression of AMY phenotypes requires the co-expression of RAMPs with the CT-R gene products (CHRISTOPOULOS et al., 1999; MUFF et al., 1999b) . Similar to its functional interaction with other proteins, RAMPs interaction with CT-Rs engenders novel receptor specificity with induction of multiple forms of AMY.", "Amylin receptors are formed when the CT-R is in complex with one of the RAMPs forming AMY1, AMY2 and AMY3 receptors (depending on which of the RAMPs is involved) (JUST et al., 2010b) . These three distinct receptors also present different cellular or tissue expression, which is an important aspect in the control of these receptors activity, specificity and pharmacology (ARMOUR et al., 1999; HAY; POYNER; SEXTON, 2006; HUSMANN et al., 2000; TILAKARATNE et al., 2000) .", "Each of these receptors binds amylin with similar affinity, while maintaining a distinct pharmacology (agonists and antagonists). More recent work revealed that RAMP2 can also induce an AMY phenotype, which is distinct from either the RAMP1 or RAMP3 induced receptors (TILAKARATNE et al., 2000; ZUMPE et al., 2000) . The pharmacological nature of the AMY that is formed by RAMPs and CT-Rs co- expression appears to be quite variable and dependent upon host-cell environment (CHRISTOPOULOS et al., 1999; TILAKARATNE et al., 2000) .", "Several CT-R splice variants have been reported (to present date, there are 6 isoforms already characterized at UNIPROT); increasing (in theory) the number of possible amylin receptors subtypes. There is considerable complexity in this system with RAMPs enabling substantial pharmacological diversity from only two GPCR genes.", "To date, the stoichiometry of the heteromers remains unclear (JUST et al., 2010a) . In addition, although the oligomers between the CT-Rs and RAMPs can then be transported to the cell surface, the CT-R is able to be transported to the cell surface in the absence of RAMPs.", "1.3.3 The Calcitonin Receptors (CT-Rs)", "G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) constitute the largest and most diverse family of membrane proteins whose primary function is to transduce extracellular stimuli into intracellular signals. They are among the largest and most diverse protein families in mammalian genomes. In humans, they represent the largest family of membrane proteins in the genome and the richest source of targets for the pharmaceutical industry (KOBILKA, 2007) . On the basis of homology with rhodopsin, they are predicted to contain seven membrane-spanning helices, an extracellular N-terminus and an intracellular C-terminus. This gives rise to their other names, the 7-TM receptors or the heptahelical receptors. GPCRs transduce extracellular stimuli to give intracellular signals through interaction of their intracellular domains with heterotrimeric G proteins (KATRITCH; CHEREZOV; STEVENS, 2013; KROEZE; SHEFFLER; ROTH, 2003; PIERCE; PREMONT; LEFKOWITZ, 2002) , and the crystal structure of one member of this group, bovine rhodopsin, has recently been solved (PALCZEWSKI et al., 2000) .", "These receptors act like entryway for a diverse range of messages or stimuli ( light, neurotransmitters, odorants, biogenic amines, lipids, proteins, amino acids, hormones, nucleotides, chemokines and, undoubtedly, many others) (FILMORE, 2004; KROEZE; SHEFFLER; ROTH, 2003; PIERCE; PREMONT; LEFKOWITZ, In addition, there are at least 18 different human Gα proteins to which GPCRs can be coupled (HERMANS, 2003; WONG, 2003) . These Gα proteins form heterotrimeric complexes with Gβ subunits, of which there are at least 5 types, and Gγ subunits, of which there are at least 11 types (HERMANS, 2003) .", "GPCRs play a role in an incredible array of functions in the human body, and increased knowledge of these receptors have great impact in modern development of pharmaceutical technologies and medicine. In fact, researchers estimate that between one-third and one-half of all marketed drugs act by interacting with GPCRs (OVERINGTON; AL-LAZIKANI; HOPKINS, 2006) . GPCRs are very important drug targets and are already identified as being involved or having important roles in several diseases such as: obesity, cardiovascular disease, inflammation, several types of cancer, di abetes and Alzheimer’s Disease (HAY; DICKERSON, 2010) - General features of GPCRs:", "Composed by 7 transmembrane domains, 3 intracellular loops, 3 extracellular loops.

The family of class B secretin-like receptors (which comprises 3 subfamilies – B1, B2 and B3) includes approximately 30 different receptors for a variety of peptide hormones and neuropeptides, including glucagon, glucagon-like peptides (GLP-1, GLP-2), glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), secretin, vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP), growth-hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH)) , calcitonin, parathyroid hormone/parathyroid hormone-related peptides and vasoactive intestinal peptide. As common features, they all trigger adenylyl cyclase and the phosphatidyl-inositol- calcium pathway (HARMAR, 2001) .", "These receptors contain seven transmembrane regions (7TM), fairly similar to those of the rhodopsins and other receptors considered to interact with G-proteins. Nevertheless, there is no significant sequence identity between these families and the secretin-like receptors have their own unique '7TM' signature (HARMAR, 2001) . Their large N terminus (~ 100 residues) is located on the extracellular side of the membrane and potentially glycosylated. This N-terminal region contains a long conserved region which allow the binding of peptide ligands (Fig. 5-6). This region contains five conserved cysteines residues that presumably form a network of disulfide bridges. Moreover, the conserved prolines in the B family are different from the conserved prolines in the A family, and the DRY motif at the TM3 is absent (GETHER, 2000; HARMAR, 2001) . The C-terminal region of these receptor is cytoplasmic. Every receptor gene in this family is encoded on multiple exons, and several of these genes are processed via alternative splicing to yield functionally distinct products (which contributes to receptor plasticity).", "By interacting with RAMPs, some members of this family shift their affinity for other peptide hormones thus expanding the range of action of these receptors. The ability for CT-R and CLR to interact with receptor activity-modifying proteins adds another level of sophistication to these receptor systems (BARWELL et al., 2012) .", "1.3.3.2 Calcitonin Family GPCRs", "The CTs are 32 amino acid peptide hormones with both peripheral and central actions mediated via specific receptors. The CT family of G protein coupled-receptors (GPCRs) are categorized as Family B or secretin-like GPCRs. These receptors are thought to share the same topology as other GPCRs with seven putative transmembrane segments (Fig. ) and interaction with heterotrimeric GTPases (G proteins) to regulate signaling pathways of intracellular second messengers such as Ca2+, cAMP and inositol phosphates.", "Family B GPCRs are approximately 500 amino acids with a relatively large extracellular N-terminal domain of >150 amino acids that contains three conserved disulfide bonds for structural stability and a signal peptide for plasma membrane translocation.", "Until now, no high resolution structure of CT-R has been deposited in the PDB database, but due to their high similarity with other members of GPCRs (e.g. CRLR) it is possible to speculate a high similarity in the structure of the ectodomain as shown by the model obtained by homology (Fig. 6).", "14Figure 5: Schematic representation of CT-R1. White residues represent missense variants or complex variants and yellow residues represent silent variants.

Not long after, the first human CT-R was cloned (GORN et al., 1992); a second CT-R, was also identified (KUESTNER et al., 1994) . The human CT- R gene includes at least 12 coding and 2 non-coding exons and is located on chromosome 7q21.3 (KUESTNER et al., 1994) . The two major variants of the human CT-R are a result of alternative splicing; CT-R1 differs from CT-R2 in the deletion of 48 bp encoding 16 amino acids in the first intracellular loop, presented by the later (KUESTNER et al., 1994) . The CT-R1 variant is the most commonly expressed and the receptor used in the initial studies identifying amylin receptors, but both receptor isoforms are extensively expressed, with the CT-R1 receptors occurring in all receptor expressing tissues and the hCT in many tissues including particularly high mRNA expression levels in placenta, ovary, lung and bone marrow (KUESTNER et The CT-R, although being the most similar receptor to CLR, does not require RAMP 15Figure 6: Homology modeling of CT-R1-ETD (superposition of three models created with different tools).

Activation of the cAMP stimulating pathway is the most potent response to ligand binding, while the agonist potency for PLC stimulation observed is at least 100-fold lower than seen for cAMP, when studied in equivalent cell backgrounds (MOORE et al., 1995) . The presence of the 16 amino acid insert in the first intracellular loop of the human CT-R2 receptor has quite profound consequences for the receptor’s ability to activate intracellular signaling pathways, with loss of PLC activation mediated by G αq, attenuation of cAMP stimulation mediated by G α and reduced agonist-induced internalizations (MOORE et al., 1995; NUSSENZVEIG; THAW; GERSHENGORN,", "1.3.3.3 Calcitonin receptor (CT-R)", "In humans, the major CT-R variants differ by the absence (CT-R1) or presence (CT- R2) of a 16 amino acid insert in the first intracellular domain, with th e CT-R(a2) being the more commonly expressed form and the variant used for initial studies with RAMPs (CHRISTOPOULOS et al., 1999; GORN et al., 1992; KUESTNER et al., 1994; MUFF et al., 1999b) . Other splice variants have also been determined, although there physiological significance is still not determined (e.g.CT-R3). These two main human CT-R isoforms differ in their ability to activate signaling pathways (presumably due to an effect on G protein coupling) and to internalize in response to agonist treatment (MOORE et al., 1995) , which may suggest a role for G proteins in the ability of RAMPs to alter receptor phenotype.", "1.3.4 RAMPs (Receptor activity-modifying proteins ), the", "second component in the AMY receptor", "1.3.4.1 Discovery and paradigm shift in the GPCR mechanisms", "In 1998, Foord and colleagues identified a single transmembrane accessory protein called receptor-activity modifying proteins that revolutionized the field of Amylin, adrenomedullin 1-2 (AM) and calcitonin gene related peptide (CGRP) receptors biology (MCLATCHIE et al., 1998) .", "Using an expression cloning strategy in Xenopus oocytes, a 148-amino acid protein (RAMP1) was identified and was shown to regulate proper translocation of calcitonin receptor-like receptor (CLR) to the plasma membrane. In addition, this protein was shown to regulate CGRP responsiveness of this receptor. Data base search revealed two additional and related RAMPs, RAMP2 and RAMP3 (Fig. 7). It was then determined that RAMP1 and CLR combination gives rise to a CGRP responsive receptor whereas RAMP2 or RAMP3 and CLR combinations give rise to an adrenomedullin receptor. Prior to McLatchie and colleagues (MCLATCHIE et al., 1998) discovery of RAMPs, adrenomedullin/CGRP receptor biologists were frustrated because heterologous expression of CLR alone gave rise to a CGRP receptor only in specific cell types (AIYAR et al., 1996; FLUHMANN et al., 1995) . McLatchie and colleagues report clarified that the presence of a particular RAMP in a specific cell line dictated whether CLR expression would give rise to a CGRP receptor or an adrenomedullin receptor, thus ending the confusion (MCLATCHIE et al., 1998) . Subsequent studies have found the differences between the action of the two peptides (amylin and calcitonin). Both signal through the Calcitonin receptor (CT-R), but amylin’s interaction is dependent on RAMPs, in contrast with that of calcitonin, which is independent. Taken together, this unique diversity in receptor interaction (four ligands, three RAMPs, two GPCRs) provided a paradigm shift in the understanding of GPCR biochemistry and showed important elements related with the plasticity of this intricate interactome, wh ile producing numerous other questions. Recent findings suggest that RAMPs may diversify ligand-receptor interaction to a much larger scale within the Class II GPCRs. In this regard, Christoupoulos and colleagues (CHRISTOPOULOS et al., 2003) showed that VPAC1 receptor (vasoactive intestinal polypeptide/ pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating peptide receptor) interacts with all three RAMPs, whereas the glucagon and PTH1 (parathyroid hormone receptor) interact only with RAMP2. Interestingly, PTH2 receptor was shown to interact with RAMP3. In a recently published study, Harikumar and colleagues (HARIKUMAR et al., 2009) presented further evidence that another member of the Class II GPCR, namely the secretin receptor associates with RAMP3, but not RAMP1 or RAMP2.", "Together these studies not only expand the repertoire of GPCRs that RAMPs interact with, they also provide evidence for selectivity of GPCRs for certain RAMP members. In addition to interaction with members of Class II GPCRs, previous studies from Dr. Henley’s group have shown that Calcium Sensing rec eptor (CaSR), which belongs to the Class III GPCR, is also regulated by RAMPs. The role of RAMPs in regulating a variety of GPCRs is only expanding and in the upcoming years we can expect that new biochemical and physiological functions of RAMPs with regard to the life-cycle of their cognate GPCRs that they regulate will be unraveled (PARAMESWARAN; SPIELMAN, 2012).", "RAMPs are a class of transmembrane proteins that interact/modulate the activities of several Class B G Protein-Coupled Receptors including the receptors for secretin, calcitonin, glucagon and vasoactive intestinal peptide (SEXTON et al., 2006) . There are three distinct types of RAMPs, designated RAMP1, RAMP2 and RAMP3, each encoded by a separate gene (YOUNG, 2005a) . All RAMPs are built around a common structure , each possessing a single transmembrane alpha-helix, an extracellular topological domain-N-terminal (ETD), and an intracellular C-terminal (as shown in figure 7).", "The interaction between RAMPs-ETD and CRLR-ETD (Calcitonin Receptor-Like Receptor – UniProt Q16602) has been extensively studied and has been demonstrated by Ter Haar and colleagues (KUSANO et al., 2008, 2012) and deposited at the PDB (accession codes – 3N7S, RAMP1-ETD in complex with CRLR-ETD; 3AQF - RAMP2-ETD in complex with CRLR-ETD) and also by Kusano and colleagues (KUSANO et al., 2012) deposited at the PDB (accession code – 3AQF, RAMP2-ETD in complex with CRLR-TED). Apart form these complexes, there are also structures deposited for RAMP1-ETD (accession code – 2YX8) (KUSANO et al., 2008) and RAMP2-ETD (accession codes – 2XVT, 3AQE) (KUSANO et al., 2012; QUIGLEY et al., 2010) – see figure 7.", "20Figure 7 - RAMPs domains schematic representation on the left (generated using TMRPres2D (SPYROPOULOS et al., 2004) ) and high resolution structures available at the PDB database for RAMP1-ETD (2YX8) and RAMP2-ETD (3AQE).

The ETD can be considered rather significant, constituting as much as 80% of the protein (as shown in Figure 7). Depending on the species, there is a predicted N- terminal signal peptide. The widespread distribution of RAMPs and their presence in tissues/cells suggest that they have other functi ons or may interact with additional receptors. RAMPs provided novel mechanisms for modulating receptor–ligand specificity (HAY; POYNER; SEXTON, 2006) .", "In common with the difficulty of reconstituting the CGRP receptor, receptors for related peptide Amylin, also proved difficult to isolate. While Amylin binding was usually associated with the presence of Calcitonin Receptors ( CT-Rs) and calcitonin antibodies linked to certain receptors, CT-Rs in transfected cell lines did not consistently yield high-affinity Amylin Receptor(AMY) (PERRY et al., 1997b) . These early evidences suggested the action of more than just the CT-Rs to act as receptors for amylin, later discovered to be the interaction with RAMP proteins (ARMOUR et al., 1999; CHRISTOPOULOS et al., 1999; HAY et al., 2005; LEUTHAUSER K et al.,", "1.3.4.3 Structure–Function", "Analysis of RAMP chimeras and deletion constructs has provided insight into domains of RAMPs that contribute to ligand and signaling specificity (JUST et al., 21Figure 8 - Alignment of the three members constituting the RAMP protein family (generated using Geneious 4.8.5 - Biomatters). The large ETDs are assigned in dark green arrows and evidentiate the representativeness of this domain in the RAMPs.", "RAMPs have a relatively large extracellular domain, a transmembrane domain and a short intracellular domain of ~10 amino acids.", "Previous studies by Fraser and colleagues using RAMP chimeras to study the structural basis of RAMP activity (CHRISTOPOULOS et al., 1999) suggested that the RAMP N-terminus was the primary domain involved in generating CGRP and AM receptor phenotypes from CLR. Recent work also suggests that, RAMPs-ETD (Extracellular Topological Domain) are sufficient to maintain the functional phenotypes of the receptors generated (FITZSIMMONS, 2003) .", "Furthermore, expression of the RAMP1 extracellular domain as a chimera with the transmembrane domain of platelet-derived growth factor receptor generated fully functional CGRP receptors with only ~10 fold loss in potency, compared to wild type receptors (FITZSIMMONS, 2003) .", "The N-terminal domain (ETD) is the main domain involved in altering the ligand binding specificity, being involved in the molecular interaction with co-receptor (GPCR) and ligand recognition (CHAUHAN; RAJARATHNAM; YALLAMPALLI, 2005; KOLLER et al., 2002) The ability of RAMP 1-ETD to functionally interact with HA-CRLR-GFP suggests that the region of interaction is in the extracellular N terminus and/or loops of CRLR. The fact that RAMP 1 was able to interact with the N terminus of CRLR fused to the secretin receptor to recapitulate the glycosylation pattern characteristic of the holo- CRLR, combined with the fact that RAMP 1-ETD can change the glycosylation pattern of HA-CRLR-GFP, indicates that the main interaction is between the ETD of RAMP 1 and the N terminus of CRLR (FITZSIMMONS, 2003) .", "Zumpe and colleagues studied the structural basis of RAMP activity in generating amylin receptors. In COS7 cells RAMP1 is more potent than RAMP2 in generating amylin receptor phenotype when co-expressed with hCT receptors (CT-Rs) and using chimeras of the RAMP2 N-terminus attached to (a)RAMP1 transmembrane domain and C-terminus and vice versa (RAMP1/2), unveiled highest specific I125-rat amylin binding with RAMP1 or RAMP2/1, indicative of the transmembrane and C-terminal domains playing an important role in the degree of amylin receptor expression. As seen for the CLR, the N-terminal domain of RAMP determined the binding phenotype of the expressed amylin receptor with similar amylin receptor phenotypes observed, with RAMP1 and the RAMP1/2 chimera engendering higher hCGRP and lower hCT affinities than the RAMP2 and RAMP2/1 induced phenotypes (ZUMPE et al., 2000) . The C-terminal domain contributes to the peptide signaling profile of the receptor complexes and could be directly involved in the interaction with G proteins in the cytoplasmic side (UDAWELA et al., 2006) .", "The C-terminal tail of RAMPs plays a significant role in modulating the G-protein coupling of amylin receptors, where the RAMPs are complexed to the calcitonin receptor. Removal of the C-terminus of RAMP1 reduced the potency of CGRP at stimulating cAMP formation at the AMY1 receptor (UDAWELA et al., 2006, 2008) . C-terminal deletion studies have added further support for the importance of this short intracellular fragment of RAMPs (UDAWELA et al., 2006, 2008) . RAMPs without the last eight amino acids in the C-terminus, RAMP1'c, RAMP2'c and RAMP3'c, respectively, had little effect on the signaling profile and plasma membrane trafficking of CLR-derived receptors, whereas its importance in generating functional amylin receptors was marked. Significant attenuation of AMY receptor phenotype induction, measured by I 125 - rat amylin binding, was observed with all three truncated RAMPs, with RAMP1'c and RAMP2'c based receptors being more impaired than those formed by RAMP3'c. Interestingly, the loss of I 125 - rat amylin binding could be partially recovered with co-expression of G αs indicating that the C-terminal deletion leads to loss of G protein coupling. Deletion of the RAMP1 C-terminus also led to attenuation of CT-R-dependent translocation of this RAMP to the cell surface (Udawela et al. 2006a), leading the authors to speculate that G proteins may be important for stabilization of the complex and that this may at least in part, contribute to the loss of I125 - amylin binding. A role for the RAMP C-terminus in defining AMY receptor signaling is also supported by RAMP chimera studies, where only the C- terminus is exchanged between RAMPs 1 and 2 (UDAWELA et al., 2006) . In that study, presence of the RAMP1 C-terminus in the RAMP2/1 chimera specifically potentiated CGRP signaling, whereas CGRP responses were attenuated for the RAMP1/2 chimera. Thus, in contrast to the CLR, it seems the RAMP C-terminus is of vital importance to the G protein coupling of CT-R-based AMY receptors, and that there are significant differences in signaling by CLR- and CT-R-based receptors. This difference could be related to the role of receptor component protein (RCP) in CLR generated receptors. RCP is important in CGRP and AM receptor-mediated signaling, as antisense knock-down of RCP expression leads to significant attenuation of cAMP signaling (PRADO M; EVANS-BAIN B; DICKERSON I, 2001) ; currently there is no evidence supporting a link between RCP and AMY receptor signaling. One could speculate that the RAMP C-terminus is of vital importance for amylin receptor G protein-coupling because there is no interaction with RCP, whereas for the CLR based receptors association with RCP promotes the G protein- coupling function, making the RAMP C-terminus of less importance for this function. In summary, the N-terminal domain is the principle domain involved in defining ligand binding specificity, whilst the combined transmembrane and C-terminal domain contribute to the degree of functional amylin receptor expression. The C-terminal domain itself contributes to the peptide signaling profile of the receptor complexes and may be directly involved in the interaction with G proteins.", "1.3.4.4 Second Messenger Activation", "To date, only limited studies on AMY receptor signaling have been performed. Where investigated, AMY receptor stimulation has resulted in robust elevations in cAMP, including L6 myocytes (CODY et al., 1991) , hepatocytes (ZENG; HOUSLAY, 1995) and D-TSH thyrotrophs (PERRY et al., 1997b) . The α-TSH thyrotroph cell line ( α- TSH cells derived from the transplantable mouse tumor MGH101 secrete only the α- subunit of TSH) has an AMY1a-like receptor, having similar affinity for CGRP and amylin, in addition to an endogenous CT-R. In this cell line, both cAMP and intracellular calcium mobilization were measured, however, amylin only evoked responses via the cAMP pathway, suggesting relatively weak coupling to calcium mobilization (PERRY et al., 1997a) . In recombinant systems, where there is a molecular definition of the receptor phenotype, analysis of signaling has been limited to stimulation of cAMP production. In all cells examined to date, there is a robust increase in cAMP accumulation following stimulation of AMY receptors, including HEK293, COS7 and RAEC (CHRISTOPOULOS et al., 1999, 2003; MUFF et al., 1999a; HAY et al., 2005; KUWASAKO et al., 2004; UDAWELA et al., 2006, 2008) . As discussed before, AMY receptors comprise CT-R/RAMP complexes and CT-Rs are known to pleiotropically couple to multiple G-proteins to modulate pathways including generation of cAMP, mobilization of intracellular calcium, and various kinases including ERK1/2 and FAK (FINDLAY; SEXTON, 2004; CHRISTOPOULOS et al., 1999; PURDUE; TILAKARATNE; SEXTON, 2002) . As such, AMY receptors have the capacity to also pleiotropically couple to multiple pathways through the CT-R component of the complex, however, the effect of RAMP on signal preference has not been explored. Nonetheless, preliminary data suggests that AMY1a and AMY3a, at least in COS7 cells, may preferentially signal to G αs without parallel increases in signaling via either calcium or ERK1/2 activation (MORFIS et al., 2008) . This remains to be fully explored but may imply that RAMPs, in addition to determining binding phenotype, may also alter the profile of signal pathway activation. A similar action has been proposed for the VPAC receptor, where RAMP2 specifically augmented IP3 signaling (CHRISTOPOULOS et al., 2003) .", "1.3.4.5 Regulation of Receptors", "The regulation and trafficking of amylin receptors has not, to date, been extensively studied, with current knowledge of regulation of RAMP containing receptors inferred from studies of the CLR-RAMP complex. Hilairet and colleagues investigated the regulation of the RAMP1 and the CLR-RAMP1 complex in HEK293T cells (HILAIRET et al., 2001). When expressed alone RAMP1 was retained in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi, predominantly as a disulfide-linked homodimer, whereas when co-expressed with CLR, RAMP1 was primarily plasma membrane-located, in complex with the CLR. Upon agonist stimulation with CGRP, the CLR is phosphorylated and the CLR-RAMP1 complex internalized together in a dynamin and β-arrestin dependent manner (HILAIRET et al., 2001) . Similarly, RAMP1 is also translocated to the cell surface by CT-R (CHRISTOPOULOS et al., 1999) , although the trafficking of the receptor components following agonist stimulation has not been studied to date.", "More recent studies of RAMP trafficking properties have revealed that the PDZ binding domain in the C-terminal tail of RAMP3 (-DTLL motif, not conserved in RAMP1 or 2), may confer novel receptor regulation to RAMP3 complexed receptors, in a cell-dependent manner (BOMBERGER et al., 2005a, 2005b) . AM1 (CLR/RAMP2) receptors are targeted to the degradative pathway following internalization, whereas, AM2 (CLR/RAMP3) receptors can display altered, antagonist-dependent trafficking, leading to receptor recycling (BOMBERGER et al., 2005a), or lack of internalization (BOMBERGER et al., 2005b) , depending upon the presence of specific PDZ containing proteins; NSF promotes receptor recycling, while NHERF1 inhibits internalization (BOMBERGER et al., 2005a, 2005b) . This altered behavior was entirely dependent on the RAMP3 PDZ binding motif. By analogy, it is probable that regulation of AMY3 receptors may also be altered depending on the types/levels of PDZ containing accessory proteins present in the cells.", "1.3.4.6 RAMP-Regulated Receptor Signaling", "There is evidence that RAMPs may also modify the signaling profile of receptors. Most information is available for RAMP/CT receptor-derived AMY receptors. In early studies, receptor isoform- and cell background-dependent differences in the ability of RAMP2 to create a high affinity AMY phenotype were identified (MORFIS et al., 2008). For example, in COS-7, and rabbit aortic endothelial cells, RAMP2 only weakly engenders amylin binding from the CT(a) receptor isoform, in contrast to strong induction of AMY phenotype when co-expressed with the CT(b) receptor isoform. The presence of the 16 amino acid insert in the first intracellular domain of the CT(b) receptor results in reduced Gq-mediated signalling and receptor internalisation (BOMBERGER et al., 2005a) . The situation is different in CHO-P cells where co-expression of either receptor isoform with RAMP2 led to strong induction of AMY phenotype. This led to the hypothesis that a component of the cellular background, potentially G proteins, could modulate RAMP/CT receptor interaction. CGRP potency for cAMP formation at RAMP/CT receptor complexes tracked with the C-terminal RAMP region as demonstrated using chimeras of RAMP1 and RAMP2 where the intracellular C-terminus was exchanged. In contrast, the binding affinity tracked with the RAMP N-terminal domain, indicating that the RAMP C-terminus played a direct role in signaling (UDAWELA et al., 2006) . RAMP C-terminal truncation also decreased amylin binding, an effect that could be partially reversed by overexpression of G αs, suggesting that the RAMP C-terminus played a direct role in G protein coupling. Further investigation revealed a preferential coupling of AMY1 and AMY3 receptors to Gs versus Gq, relative to CT(a) receptors (CT-R2) expressed alone. Furthermore, G α subtypes differentially influence the amount of 125I-amylin binding to RAMP/CT(a) complexes.", "Gs over-expression increased binding of RAMP2/CT-R2 and RAMP3/CT-R2 complexes but Gq only increased binding at RAMP3/CT-R2 complexes. Taken together, these data support a direct role for the RAMP C-terminal (KUWASAKO et", "1.4 Interaction RAMPs: GPCRs: Ligand", "The interaction between RAMPs-ETD and CRLR-ETD (Calcitonin Receptor-Like Receptor – UniProt Q16602) has been extensively studied and has been demonstrated by Ter Haar and colleagues (KUSANO et al., 2008, 2012) and deposited at the PDB (accession codes – 3N7S, RAMP1-ETD in complex with CRLR-ETD (Fig. 9); 3AQF - RAMP2-ETD in complex with CRLR-ETD) and also by Kusano and colleagues (KUSANO et al., 2012) deposited at the PDB (accession code – 3AQF, RAMP2-ETD in complex with CRLR- ETD).", "The structures of these complexes had been elucidated by X-ray protein crystallography and represent a valuable contribution to better understand the interactions between the ETDs of these co-receptors.

In this company, it has been developed a similar peptide to human IAPP, called ''Amlintide''. However, in the same way that human, this analogue formed amyloid fibrils in vitro, which made its administration unsuitable as a substitute amylin.

Amylin decays rapidly in plasma, with a half-life (t0.5) of approximately 13 min (YOUNG et al., 1996) ; therefore, increasing amylin's t0.5 would be a desirable strategy to achieve effective basal hormone restoration.", "In an attempt to develop a conjugated amylin product with improved control over glycemia, our group evaluated the PEGylation strategy using two distinct methoxy polyethylene glycol (mPEG) succinimidyl coupling agents, namely, mPEG succinimidyl carbonate (mPEG-SC; and mPEG succinimidyl propionate (mPEG- SPA), both in aqueous (phosphate buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4) and nonaqueous solvents (e.g. dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)).

GPCRs represent the major signaling system in mammalian cells and are subdivided into three groups: Family A, the largest family, containing receptors for prototypical neurotransmitters and hormones; Family B, incorporating receptors for peptide hormones such as calcitonin (CT) and secretin; and Family C, which includes receptors for small molecules such as glutamate and GABA.1 GPCRs, like other signaling proteins, can form oligomeric protein arrays which may be critical to many aspects of their function. For many GPCRs it is likely that constitutive dimers or oligomers act as the core functional unit. Furthermore, these receptors, as either a monomer or oligomeric complex, may also interact with other proteins that regulate their function. Interactions such as these create novel opportunities for drug discovery and development as exemplified by the receptor activity-modifying protein (RAMP) family (MCGUANE; CONRAD, 2012; SALON; LODOWSKI; PALCZEWSKI, 2011; SEXTON et al., 2012) .", "Because of their role in inducing, altering or shifting the activity of several GPCR proteins, RAMPs represent a potential and very challenging target for different classes of drugs.

The simplicity of the procedure, which requires only the mixing of glutaraldehyde with the protein solution, the availability of glutaraldehyde as a common reagent easily found in a biochemical laboratory, and the direct detection of crosslinked products by sodium dodecyl sulfate– polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS–PAGE) have led to the wide application of this method. The major limitation of the technique arises from the nonspecific character of the reagent, which can react with all the nitrogens of a protein and mainly with lysines, tyrosines, histidines, and arginines. Intra- and intermolecular links are formed that could connect atoms of neighboring but not interacting molecules, yielding artificial protein oligomers that lack biological significance. To reduce the occurrence of artificial interactions, the proper reaction conditions must be established through a detailed and often time-consuming investigation of the influence of many parameters such as protein concentration, reagent concentration, temperature, and time of reaction (FADOULOGLOU; KOKKINIDIS; GLYKOS, 2008) Because of the above stated reasons, the assays developed were first optimized concerning different parameters (e.g. protein concentration, reaction time, glutaraldehyde concentration, etc) and then applied to different samples. The conditions preferred for the assays, were the mildest possible, with the lower concentration of cross-linker and lower reaction times possible in order to avoid artificial interactions to the most. The outcome of these assays should be considered with caution and supported by other techniques, particularly in the cases that protein- protein interactions (PPI) are the subject of study.", "4.1.1 Stepwise oligomerization of murine amylin", "In the initial steps of the characterization of our system, an assessment in the oligomerization abilities of the individual components was performed. Amylin, particularly human, has a natural tendency to form oligomers, being that stepwise association is a characteristic feature the process of amyloid fibrils formation. Regarding murine amylin, its self association and ability to form amyloid fibers was reported in previous works, but is associated with very particular circumstances (by dissolving lyophilized amylin directly with Tris-HCl buffer pH 7.4, while attempts to dissolve with water or phosphate buffered saline did not result into amyloid fibrils) (MILTON; HARRIS, 2013b) . Moreover, formation of murine amylin amyloid assemblies has been reported with discretion in the literature (GREEN et al., 2003) , and so far these data have not received much attention.", "To understand the oligomerization of mAmylin in the conditions performed in our assays, crosslinking studies were performed in similar conditions to those reported elsewhere (SAWAYA et al., 2007) .", "Murine amylin was incubated with 0.5% (v/v) glutaraldehyde (for 1h at 25ºC) and subjected to SDS-PAGE (Fig. 17) as described in detail in Section 3.10.

Typically, the presence and amount of a fluorescently-labeled analyte is correlated to the intensity of the fluorescence measured.", "Fluorescence Polarization The use of fluorescence polarization (FP) uses a fluorophore's properties to indicate binding state and microenvironment. Polarization is a measurement of a molecule's rotation from its excitation until its emission. Polarization (P) is defined as: Where I|| is the emission intensity parallel to the excitation plane and I ┴ is the intensity perpendicular to the excitation plane.", "In the actual measurement of polarization there is usually an angle between the excitation dipole and the emission dipole within a molecule.", "Anisotropy Another term representing the degree of polarized emission is anisotropy (r) which is defined as:", "The difference between polarization and anisotropy is in the presence of a second perpendicular intensity term in the denominator. The definition of anisotropy takes into account the second possible perpendicular emission plane, which is oriented along the axis of propagation. Anisotropy is a more accurate representation of the physical phenomena because it takes into consideration the contribution of all degrees of rotational freedom and reflects orientations of constrained molecules that can be detected through two-dimensional mapping of polarized fluorescence emission (JAMESON; SAWYER, 1995; LAKOWICZ, 2006a, 2006b) .", "Both can be used to analyze macromolecular interactions in which one of the reactants is labeled with a fluorophore.

In this work, the labeled proteins with FITC are used as the fluorophores in a polarization assay. The advantages of using FITC as the fluorophore is the high reactivity of the isothiocyanate moiety and the high quantum yield of fluorescein, thus allowing the detection of very small concentration of labeled protein in microplate assays. The disadvantage is the high bleaching rate for fluorescein requiring small / low light exposure.", "Protein-FITC is then titrated with protein Y, and the equilibrium C50% is obtained from the increase in anisotropy that accompanies complex formation. A free fluorescein-labeled ligand is likely to rotate more rapidly and therefore to have a lower rotational correlation time than does the FITC–X·Y complex. An increase in rotational correlation time upon binding results in an increase in anisotropy, which can be used to assess complex formation (JAMESON; SAWYER, 1995) . In these assays, the interaction between the two proteins is assessed in a homogeneous solution.", "The assays were performed with the FITC-labeled proteins used in a constant concentration of 50 nM and the unlabeled proteins (RAMP1, RAMP2, mAmylin, CT- R1 and 3) have been serially diluted.

For the assays with CT-R3 and RAMP1, the results showed that the profiles of interaction were similar for both free and PEGylated amylin, but for higher concentrations (above 10 μM) there was a significant difference in the anisotropy 103Figure 46 - Amylin self-assembly and interaction with co-receptors.

The ESI source operates at atmospheric pressure and the sample solution is sprayed from a small syringe into a strong electric field in the presence of a flow of warm nitrogen to assist desolvation. The droplets formed evaporate in a region maintained at a vacuum of several torr causing the charge to increase on the droplets. The multiply charged ions then enter in the Ion-Mobility spectrometry coupled apparatus. The most important feature of this ionization is that the ions carry multiple charges, which reduces their mass-to-charge ratio compared to a singly charged species. This allows mass spectra to be obtained for large molecules or even mixed size samples, which potentiates the resolution for proteomic applications. Not all proteins are able to be ionized by this source or in some cases the conditions where that occur are challenging to uncover (being one of major drawbacks only solved by experimentation, trial and error).", "Ion-mobility spectrometry–mass spectrometry (IMS-MS) is a powerful method that is potentially able to separate components on a millisecond timescale using ion- mobility spectrometry and coupled with mass spectrometry on a microsecond timescale to identify them within a sample. In this technique, gaseous ions are separated not only on the basis of their mass to charge ratio, but also of their size and shape (LÓPEZ et al., 2013) . Continuous technical advances have increased the sensitivity and resolution power of IMS-MS, and the development of soft ionization techniques has prompted the structural study of biomolecules. The applications of this technique have been growing steadily ever since (BOHRER et al., 2008; RUOTOLO et al., 2008) to a wide range of applications and fields (structural biology, protein-protein interactions – PPI, etc). IM-MS data are inherently three-dimensional, consisting of mass, drift time and intensity (relative abundance) data for all the ions observed.", "Generally, plots of drift time versus m/z, reveal trends in the data that can be indicative of either the charge state or molecular class of the ions observed, even in situations where the envelope of the ion is not clear (HOAGLUND et al., 1998; RUOTOLO, 2002; RUOTOLO et al., 2002; VALENTINE et al., 1998) . In the case of analyzing known samples (known MW), that can be overcome by the previous calculation of the possible ions that can be found in a spectrum.", "For most protein complex ions, it has been observed that the signals for a charge state series corresponding to a monodisperse protein assembly display a good correlation (R2 > 0.99) to a linear relationship between drift time and m/z allowing for polydisperse samples to be identified readily (GANGLOFF, 2008) by analyzing series of ions that are in a different line (exhibit a different slope) in the spectrum. If protein complexes are separated by ion mobility as intact assemblies and are activated before mass measurement, any fragmentation products generated will appear at the same drift time as the original parent ion. Therefore, three-dimensional representations of IM-MS data are of critical importance for the interpretation. IMS-MS allows the separation of the spectral congestion typical of ESI resulted by multiple charged species and oligomeric species by adding another dimension of separation. This allows the identification and accurate sample characterization. In the present work, this technique has been used to analyze particularly the interaction between RAMP2 – mAmylin and RAMP2 – hAmylin truncated peptides. For that purpose, the samples were prepared as described in Materials and Methods section and their analysis performed using software tools supplied the equipment manufacturers. The analyzed samples are described in the Table 3.", "As mentioned above, in the cases that samples subject of analysis are known, it is possible and advisable to, previous to data analysis, calculate the theoretical ions that possibly will be present in the spectrum given by the equipment after sample analysis. To calculate the theoretical ions in a given sample, for this study, spreadsheets were calculated applying the following formula:", "Ion(m/z)=Molecularweight+Charge Charge - The “molecular weight” used is from the subject protein or complex (e.g. oligomer, protein-protein complex, protein – peptide) - The “charge” corresponds to the charged state of the ion. Depending on the size of the protein and intrinsic properties (different amino acids have different propensities to ionization) the number of charges has to be adequate. Other factor limiting the calculation of charges is the range of m/z detection selected in the equipment. After these simple calculations we have a list of theoretical m/z for a given sample. This values are genuinely found in the results, but a careful consideration must be taken care because of the presence of adducts (e.g. sodium, potassium). In this case, adducts are positive ions that can be adsorbed to the protein and if some shift is detected in the m/z of ions, it is just a matter of including that in calculation (by adding the mass of the adduct to the molecular weight in the formula.

SAXS is intrinsically a low resolution method because samples move freely in solution during data acquisition resulting in spherically averaged scattering intensity curves. To obtain a SAXS scattering profile, x-rays with a constant wavelength (λ) irradiate a purified protein sample solution (using a concentrated sample of ~1.0-3.0 mg/ml). As the X-rays collide with the sample, they scatter elastically. The scattered X-rays are captured on a detector as spots of varying intensity. The overall SAXS scattering profile is calculated by subtracting the scattering profile of the blank buffer solution from the profile of the sample dispersed in solution (background subtraction or reduction) (BLANCHET; SVERGUN, 2013; SVERGUN; PETOUKHOV; KOCH, 2001) .", "A SAXS scattering measurement represents a molecule’s rotationally average intensity (I) as a function of scattering angle (q). In this representation, large pairwise atomic distances are represented by small scattering angles and small pair wise atomic distances are represented by large scattering angles. The information content of a SAXS profile is much less than other high resolution experimental techniques because the overall scattering curve represents the radially averaged contribution of all non hydrogen surface atoms in all orientations (FÖRSTER et al., 2008; PUTNAM et al., 2007). Despite this limitation, several parameters can be extracted directly from the scattering curve which enables fast sample characterization. These parameters include the molecular weight (MW), radius of gyration (Rg), hydrated particle volume (Vp) and maximum particle diameter (Dmax). Furthermore, the SAXS scattering curve contains information related to the overall shape of the molecule and is routinely used to validate structural models (BLANCHET; SVERGUN, 2013; FÖRSTER et al., 2008) . The Guinier analysis is a rapid method to compute protein size, particle interactions (aggregation), oligomeric state, and overall data quality. First, the radius of gyration and forward scattering I(0) are easily obtained from a plot of ln[I(q)] vs. q2. For monodisperse samples, this plot should be a linear line where the radius of gyration is the slope and the y intercept is I(0). If the Guinier plot is nonlinear, that may indicate inter-particle interactions, polydispersity, or improper background subtraction.", "The I(0) value normalized to solute concentration is proportional to the MW. The MW can be used to distinguish different oligomeric states.", "After Guinier analysis, the distance distribution function, p(r), is computed by a Fourier transformation of the SAXS pattern. This function represents the SAXS data in real space and gives information about the overall shape of the macromolecule. For example, a spherical particle has a bell shaped p(r) curve. Direct Fourier transformation of the SAXS profile is not possible and indirect Fourier methods must be used. Because the original SAXS profile contains all of the information from which the p(r) curve is derived, we used SAXS profiles directly for analysis without computing the distance distribution function.", "GNOM GNOM is an indirect transform program for small-angle scattering data processing. It reads in one-dimensional scattering curves and evaluates the particle distance distribution function p(r) (for monodisperse systems) or the size distribution function D(R) (for polydisperse systems) (SVERGUN, 1992) .", "SAX MOW (Molecular weight of proteins in solution determined from a single SAXS measurement on a relative scale) This tool is a new and simple method to determine the molecular weight of proteins in dilute solution, with an error smaller than ~ 10%, by using experimental data of a single small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) curve measured on a relative scale. This procedure offer the main advantage of not requiring the measurement of SAXS intensity on an absolute scale and does not involve a comparison with another SAXS curve determined from a known standard protein. The proposed procedure can be applied to monodisperse systems of proteins in dilute solution, either in monomeric or multimeric state, and it was successfully tested on SAXS data experimentally determined for proteins with known molecular weights.", "Importantly, this method allows for an unambiguous determination of the multimeric state of proteins with known molecular weight in dilute solutions (FISCHER et al., 2010) – available at http://www.if.sc.usp.br/~saxs/ .", "OLIGOMER The program OLIGOMER fits an experimental scattering curve from a multicompoment mixture of proteins to find the volume fractions of each component in the mixture. The input data for OLIGOMER is experimental SAXS or SANS scattering curve from a mixture of several distinct components and a set of form- factors for each component of this mixture (KONAREV et al., 2003) .

To create form-factor file from pdb files we used the program FFMAKER (also part of the ATSAS suite) that automatically creates form-factor file (KONAREV et al., 2003) To create the form-factors used in OLIGOMER, we worked with three sets of structures.

Since the high resolution structure of RAMP2-ETD has already been determined by X-ray Crystallography, in the experiments we focused on the effect of amylin in the oligomerization process and showing another evidence of direct interaction between the two components of the AMY receptor in the absence of the CT-R.", "The following rationale is behind the data presented in the following sections: - GNOM program was used to evaluate the particle distance distribution function p(r). The program parameters were used as our system was monodisperse because we obtained a better fitting of the curves and the main goal of using GNON was to generate an appropriate fitting to supply the SAX MOW tool; - SAX MOW tool was used with the GNOM output files to determine the oligomeric state and radius of gyration (Rg).; - Ffmaker program (included in the ATSAS package) was used to obtain the form- factors for the pdbs containing the structures of the oligomers described before (for the individual oligomers as well their combination; - OLIGOMER program was used with created form factors to determine the oligomeric state of RAMP2 in the three samples analyzed. The use of three different sets is justified by the different orientations adopted by the proteins in the two different structures deposited at the PDB database ( 2XVT and 3AQE). This rationale was developed because of the limitations presented by SAXS when analyzing polydisperse systems where the structures of all the assembles are well determined. The behavior and structure adopted by proteins in solution and in a crystal can be different and another aspect that plays crucial influence in the strategy used is that there is no information relative to the stoichiometry of interaction between RAMP2 and amylin in the specific conditions of these experiment (mainly because of the concentrations needed for SAXS that are much higher than for other experiments).", "A real-space analysis obtained from the Fourier transform of the scattering profile using GNOM program (Fig. 71), it has been possible to observe a distinction in the scattering profile of RAMP2 when amylin is present (Fig. 71a). It allowed the recovery of mean structural parameters of the RAMP2-ETD in solution, including the radii of gyration (Rg) of approximately 34-35 Å. The obtained pair-distribution function P(r) also revealed a similar molecular shape for all samples.", "Together, these data indicate that RAMP2 had not undergone significant structural variation upon interaction with amylin. Although there is an observable differentiation in scattering profiles, the low molecular weight could be the major responsible for this effect. Other important aspect it is worth mentioning is that when two proteins that do not interact are measured by SAXS (isolated and in a mixture), the individual 146Figure 71 - Experimental SAXS profile of the three samples analyzed and GNOM program fitting (a). b) Pair-distribution function P(r) calculated by the GNOM program for the same samples. scattering profiles can be summed to give the scattering of the mixture. We performed that simple exercise and the scattering of the mixture was different, revealing once again that there is an interaction between the two proteins (Fig. 72).", "4.4.1 RAMP2 analysis", "Proceeding with the rationale described to analyze the samples, the output of the GNOM program was subjected to the SAX MOW program to determine an average oligomeric state for the samples.

Overall we can state that mAmylin has a clear effect over the oligomerization of RAMP2.

Traditionally, the studies surrounding the action of hormones (e.g. amylin) and their interactions with receptors are performed in cellular environments. By reducing the complexity associated with working with whole cells, the present work and its strategy allowed to focus at the molecular level in ways to study, specifically, some of the components that intervene in this small interactome. Questions like dynamic oligomeric transitions and states (RAMPs and amylin and interactions study, component-by-component, were proposed new ways to be addressed.", "With this thesis we intended to apply a set of biochemical and biophysical methods to study the interaction of the components in this interactome always envisioning its wider application not only to characterize PPI (protein-protein interactions) but also provide valuable tools to act as support tools to the development of new or existing biopharmaceutical products. The complexity hindered by the evaluation and development of biopharmaceutical products requires new methodologies that were traditionally applied only in “fundamental research”.", "The techniques and assays described in previous sections bear great potential of application in the development of new drugs related with RAMPS, GPCRs (e.g. CT- Rs) and Amylin and even practical usage as High Throughput (HTP) techniques for the analysis of protein-protein interactions (PPI) to assess the biopharmaceuticals modifications.", "A multidisciplinary approach where molecular biology, biophysics, molecular modeling, X-ray diffraction techniques (e.g. protein crystallography and SAXS) applied to proteins, physiology, receptor pharmacology, pharmaceutical biotechnology could walk side by side and contribute to the advancement of science, technology and knowledge.", "Our goal is that this project can be a proof of concept, creating a starting point in the establishment of new methodologies in the study of an important interactome that have implications in metabolic diseases and advance of fundamental knowledge related with amylin and its associated co-receptors.", "This work represent a contribution to conjugate different complementary methodologies that will serve not only as a starting point to deepen characterization of the amylin interactome but also serve as a guide to study other members of this GPCR family and its interaction with other hormones that play important roles in the control of metabolism. Moreover, with this work we open a new hypothesis of direct interaction between Amylin and RAMPs, or at least we hope to diversify the questioning related with the interactions within this three component system (RAMP:Amylin:CT-R).", "7 Bibliography", "ABUCHOWSKI, A. et al.

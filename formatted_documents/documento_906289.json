Those improvements brought speed in our daily lives. Then, we are suddenly drowning in tones of instant messages, emails, photos, social networks interactions which consume hours of our da ily-routine and massively changed the way people interact, consume goods and discover new things. According to GSM Association (2016), worldwide we have more than 5 billion people using smartphones which represents almost 67% of total world population. In Brazil, according to Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatística (IBGE), there were more than 130 million smartphone users in 2015, which represents more than 60% of total population; around 80% of the urban population and 50% of rural population have access to devices. Each year we have more 10 million smartphones´ users added in this account in Brazil. Some factors are direct responsible for influence people´s decision to purchase a smartphone such as income and education. The number of users is highe r among representants with higher education and income when compare with low income and education users. Although, the smartphone access is spread among classes C and D because of the increased of purchasing power in Brazil.", "According to the 2018 Global Digital Report, Brazilians spend, on average, more than 9 hours daily on internet, where 3 and half hours is spending only on social networks apps. Surprisingly, this number is 50% bigger than the hours spent by a global internet user, which spends just 6 hours daily on the internet. Consequently, this dissemination of portable devices that support mobile electronic transactions associated with the consolidation of high -speed internet networks were responsible for the strengthening and growth of the m-commerce The evolution of self -service technology, for example, promoted a deep change in the way customers interact with companies in service purchasing, where face -to-face has been gradually replaced by the “do yourself” with the use of machinery and electronic assistance anywhere, anytime. (Eisenmann, Parker, & Alstyne, 2006; Jonash, Koehler, & Onassis, 2007; Tiwana, 2013) Actually, the mobile platform has fundamentally revolutionized the manner in which companies maintain customer relations by creating the unique, novel, and personalized experience (Eisenmann et al., 2006; Jonash et al., 2007; Tiwana, 2013) . Companies are aware of the importance to have a good image on the internet thus they are engaging customers through it. Many changes happened in the relationship between customers and companies. Therefore, companies have started to use apps to increase brand awareness and enhance brand experience, resulting in higher sales (Eisenmann et al., 2006; Jonash et al., 2007; Tiwana, 2013) . Those technological improvements that facilitates trade could bring benefits such as reduction of transaction costs and possibility of more information to participants, increasing access to a wide range of products, efficiency gains as well as resu lt in welfare improvements for the entire economy (Eisenmann et al., 2006; Reinartz, Wiegand, & Imschloss, 2019) .", "However, because more consumers are choosing for the convenience of digital shopping and the mail -order delivery, many physical ret ailers are seeing foot traffic plunge. Multiple forces give rise to internet -based retailing's dynamic growth. On one hand, the consumer perspectives include more and better information availability about a product. This readily available information enabl es customers to make a well -informed decision. On the other hand, in instances where such information is not available, the customer will not be inclined towards using the mobile app (Eisenmann et al., 2006; Jonash et al., 2007; Tiwana, 2013) . Other fact ors such as larger assortments, greater transparency across vendors and potentially lower prices because of lower fixed -cost operations also influence the consumer decisions to purchase online (Eisenmann et al., 2006; Reinartz et al., 2019) . Certainly, n ew players such as manufacturers or online platforms increasingly enter the retailing arena and challenge that interface, thereby contributing to physical retailing's decline in importance (Eisenmann et al., 2006; Jonash et al., Indeed, digital transformation facilitates and enables new ways of value creation because it allows for the fulfilment of long -standing consumer needs in unprecedented ways. The basic premise is customers will prefer to interact with the players that best provide the benefits sought in each buying situation (Eisenmann et al., 2006; Reinartz et al., 2019) . Previous research in this area identify this following dimensions as sources of value creation, automation, individualization, ambient embeddednes s, interaction, and transparency and control combine plenty of activities and processes which not only will influence on consumers decisions on purchase as well as will go further than that, for instance, user experience sharing or effects on product use v alue (Devaraj, Krajewski, & Wei, 2007; Jonash et al., 2007; Pigatto, Guilherme, Ferraz, Negreti, & Machado, 2017; Tiwana, 2013) .", "1.2 Food Delivery World Context", "Mobile communication technologies triggered mobile commerce development across the world. The rap id adoption of smartphones and subsequent development of mobile applications (“app” or “apps”) have been changing the ways in which customers interact with a brand. Suggesting that apps have deeply penetrate the daily lives of smartphone users. Today, everything can be practically purchased online, from daily grocery to flight or hotel bookings, ordering food or even buying a house (Eisenmann et al., 2006; Jonash et al., 2007; Tiwana, 2013) . Consumers accustomed to shopping online through apps or websites, with maximum convenience and transparency, increasingly expect the same experience when it comes to ordering dinner (Eisenmann et al., 2006; Reinartz et al., 2019) . The possibility of buying food online while remaining more time at home or at work, for example, has become an option for many people. Technology penetration , mainly smartphone and online penetration , has only been slightly relevant to the speed of adoption so far due to the geographic expansion of food players. We believe that the food categ ory will grow in line with the smartphone category as new smartphone users adapt their behavior to take full advantage of the technology (Devaraj et al., 2007; Jonash et al., 2007; Pigatto et al., 2017; Tiwana, 2013) . Thus, changes in the lifestyle, along with the use of smartphones in the daily routine, allowed the emergence of the online delivery model, which could be viewed as a business opportunity (Eisenmann et al., 2006; Jonash et al., 2007; Tiwana, 2013) .", "Consumer demand for online d elivery is growing rapidly and their interest in food delivery is up year over year. Worldwide, the market for food delivery stands at €83 billion, or 1% of the total food market or 4% of food sold through restaurants and fast -food chains. It has an overall annual growth rate estimated at just 3.5% for the next five years. Furthermore, as in so many other sectors, the rise of digital technology is reshaping the market (Eisenmann et al., 2006; Reinartz et al., 2019) . Meanwhile, more restaurants, including some large fast food chains, are now making delivery part of their strategies (Devar aj et al., 2007; Jonash et al., 2007; Pigatto et al., 2017; Tiwana, 2013) . Many factors contributed for this growth such as the increased purchasing power of C and D classes associated with the need for fast food a result of the lack of time, extra conve nience, improvement in telecommunication infrastructure and the low cost of smartphones, among other factors, allowed the rapid growth and exponential of this new business model (Hult et al., 2012) .", "According to Morgan Stanley´s report, in 2016, 43% of consumers who ordered food for delivery say it replaced a meal at a restaurant, up from 38%, suggesting incremental cannibalization of dine -in meals. Besides, share of orders placed online through a delivery service website or app increased to 18%, vs. 15% last year (Eisenmann et al., 2006; Jonash et al., 2007; Tiwana, 2013) . Customers drawn to the new online food -delivery platforms have a different set of needs and expectations from the traditional pizza customer (Eisenmann et al., 2006; Reinartz et al. , 2019) . In 2015, Mckinsey & Co held a consumer research in three continents in order to uncover the following important traits regarding platform´s user behavior: speed of delivery reveals to be the most important variable in consumer´s satisfaction; alm ost 82% of orders were placed from home against only 16% were place from the workplace; the highest -volume days for online platforms were Friday, Saturday and Sunday where 74% of orders were placed. Besides, this previous study reveals that once customers sign up for a platform , 80% never or rarely leave for another platform, creating a strong winner takes all dynamic.", "By 2022, digital food delivery may comprise 11% of total market, vs. 6% today. Delivery has become a driving force in the restaurant indust ry and a key investor debate (Devaraj et al., 2007; Jonash et al., 2007; Pigatto et al., 2017; Tiwana, 2013) . More than two -thirds of today’s urban delivery start -up action is in one category: prepared -food delivery. A new set of competitors , which are on-demand urban delivery providers , has since entered the B2C delivery market. These start -ups, including Deliveroo and Foodora in Europe, as well as DoorDash and Postmates in the United States offer a different form of service: they integrate demand aggreg ation via their own mobile platforms with dedicated in -house operations to enable (almost) instant delivery. (Hult et al., 2012) Noting that restaurants have started looking beyond dedicated delivery startups to potentially working with much bigg er players in retail, and beyond, who could offer robust logistical infrastructure, greater operational scale and broader consumer reach , which creates value for food providers (Eisenmann et al., 2006; Jonash et al., 2007; Tiwana, 2013) . Namely, the succ ess of the urban delivery market depends on scale at a level that is only possible with heavy up -front investment. Winners in this space are already emerging, and their dominance is clear (Eisenmann et al., 2006; Reinartz et al., 2019) As a result of the se investments, between 2014 and 2015, the two largest companies , iFood and HelloFood, which the last was sold to iFood in 2016, captained by international groups, acquired nine Brazilian companies that provided such services in different regions of Brazil (Devaraj et al., 2007; Jonash et al., 2007; Pigatto et al., 2017; Tiwana, 2013) . On a national level, there are typically two or three competitors that dominate, mostly driven by their ability to build a large user base (Eisenmann, 2006) . As with oth er forms of two -sided markets, retail platforms give rise to network effects because the platform's overall value to sellers and buyers increases with a growing user base on either side (Hult et al., 2012) . Hence, large platforms tend to grow even more w hile small competitors are pushed out of the market, resulting in winner -takes all outcomes (Eisenmann et al., 2006; Reinartz et al., 2019) .", "Furthermore , one of the main benefits to join a platform is because players in this category provide th e logistics for the restaurant. This allows them to open a new segment of the restaurant market to home delivery: higher -end restaurants that traditionally did not deliver. The new -delivery players are compensated by the restaurant with a fixed margin of t he order, as well as with a small flat fee from the customer (Devaraj et al., 2007; Jonash et al., 2007; Pigatto et al., 2017; Tiwana, 2013) . Consequently, at the supplier side, with the arrival of digital platforms, commercial establishments have gained the option and opportunity to focus only on process operation steps , such as in their core business as well as it was possible to reduce tasks and investments in non -core activities (Eisenmann, 2006) . Moreover , companies have started to use apps to incr ease brand awareness and enhance brand experience, resulting in higher sales. There are plenty of attributes for a mobile app or website, which influences a consumer's purchase intention (Hult et al., 2012) . Meanwhile, for these companies, the increasing use of the service by a growing number of consumers has generated the highest number of accesses, a factor that serves as an indicator to attract new restaurants to its website and investors for business expansion to other regions (Eisenmann, 2006) .", "However, besides all possible gains when join a platform , one of the challenges faced by them is because of their nature to be generalist, lack on creating more individualized relationship with users . Retailers and brands may offer solutions, expertis e, and tailored customer experiences for products and thus serve as gatekeepers with respect to many decisions once made on online retail platforms. As consequence, the attractiveness of general platforms may also suffer (Devaraj et al., 2007; Kumar & Pug azhendhi, 2012) . In addition, brands fear losing access to their customers, transaction commissions tend to be significant, and some platforms choose to sell their own versions of certain products once they realize the revenue potential of those products, that might threat revenue of current users. Therefore, some brands will not consider selling on those platforms and other brands withdraw after their negative experience with the platform. Brands often search for ways to be independent of those platforms, especially large brands that do have enough clout on their own (Hult et al., 2012) . Indeed, platform businesses have revolutionized many retailing markets and forced traditional players to exit the market or consider far -reaching strategy adaptati on (Eisenmann, 2006) . The mobile platform has fundamentally revolutionized the way companies maintain customer relations by creating the unique, novel, and personalized experience (Devaraj et al., 2007; Kumar & Pugazhendhi, 2012) . Transformative busine ss model innovations often become necessary, because competing head -to-head on product sales with fully grown retail platforms is almost always a lost cause. Consequently, platforms have come to dominate online retail sales. Digitization breaks up retail's monopolistic ownership of the customer interface and provides opportunities for new gatekeepers to emerge. It shifts traditional retail functions to different players, rendering the creation of competitive advantage based on these functions increasingly d ifficult. Moreover, digitization also gives rise to new sources of value creation, which address long -standing customer needs more effectively than previously possible (Hult et", "1.3 Food Delivery - The Brazilian Context", "Society has been changing in a fast pace. Nowadays, time is an important asset in everyone´s lives. The increase of convenience aligned with the shortage of available time gave space to develop a new market of food delivery platforms (Eisenmann, 2006) . In Braz il, a survey conducted in 2017 by Sebrae with about 1,800 small business that operate in the away - from -home food segment found that half of the restaurants and eateries offer the service. In addition, 19% said that they want to bet on delivery services (if they don´t have one yet) and 28% plan to invest in online ordering over the next two years (ABRASEL - Associação Brasileira de Bares e Restaurantes, 2019) .", "Regarding the Brazilian´s consumption and preferences of this ty pe of service, a study held by the QualiBest Institute shows that the food digital platforms has 93% of knowledge rate by the public. Despite of iFood isolated leadership, the number of competitors has been increasing and jeopardizing the “ winner takes al l dynamics ”. Uber Eats is cited by 32% of respondents, followed by apps from restaurants themselves with 28%, Pedidos Já appears with 20%, Rappi with 17%, Delivery Much with 14%, Glovo with 11% and Rapiddo with 7%. Moreover, according to the survey, 60% of users using food delivery applications belong to class A and B and 65% reside in the Southeast of Brazil. The average ticket per registered person was R$38.00 and the app usage intensifies on weekends and holidays (Instituto Qua libest, 2019) . Certainly , ordering food via apps is already common habit among consumers. In October of 2018, ifood accounted for 390,000 orders per day in Brazil. This number surpassed by 109% from the number of daily orders in October 2017. Ot her food delivery platforms such as Uber Eats agreed with this Brazilian growth although, they didn´t disclosure their numbers. The demand for food delivery in Brazil is notable growing more than other places such as US, Europe and Asia (ABRASEL - Associação Brasileira de Bares e Restaurantes, 2019) . Indeed , platforms are changing the way consumers and food providers are interacting all over the world . There are recent investigations that have already addressed the value cr eated by platforms for customers. However, few studies addressed the value creation to food providers and the main reason s they want to join food platforms. Thus , in order to understand how this value is perceived by food brands and food providers in Brazi l, this study aims to answer the following research question:", "RQ: Wh y food providers want to join food delivery platforms?", "1.4 The role of food delivery platforms for food retailers", "It is well -know the service that food delivery platforms provide fo r customers: facilitate payment options and delivery, different kinds of menu options available, easy access in a friendly -user app and the security if you have any problem with your order that would be solved by the platform. On the other hand, what are the services that platforms provide for the restaurants?", "When platforms are integrated with the restaurant´s operations, it can perform many activities that usually is done by many workers. Platforms offer to food retailers automatization of operation s’ activities, deepening specialization in the sector and access to huge customer network which the platform deeply understands their preferences and needs. Basically, restaurants operate the following activities presented in the figure 1 below : Figure 1 - Restaurant´s Operations", "Source: Autho r Figure 2- Platforms activities in the food retail", "Source: Author", "In the figure 2, some activities such as marketing, receive orders, payment and delivery could be performed by food delivery platforms if the restaurant decided to join. Despite of exploit the advantages of automatization of routine operations in the restaurant, food retailers join food delivery platforms because they expect and seek to other advantages that in this study will call as drivers for them to join.", "First, one of the advantages of use food delivery platform, that this study believes that could be a possible drive to food retail ers decide to join platform, is the information about the customer network. Food delivery platform have access to relevant information regarding customer such as demographic (social class, income , gender, age, etc) and their preferences (preferences of ki nd of food, how many times order per week/ month, each days usually to order more, from where they usually order food - work or home, etc). This relevant information plays a big role when the platform decides to promote a restaurant to target/reach new cus tomers with this preference. The promotions are more efficient because they align customer needs to what the restaurant offers that could be a specific kind of food, quality or price, for instance. This study believes that food retailers want to join food delivery platforms in order to increase revenue to the business. There are two possible ways of doing it which are: by raising products´ prices or by increasing volume of sales. The second option is more viable for food business because this sector is very price sensitive. As consequence, in order to increase volume of sales, this study believes that the access to this customer network, in order to reach new clients, could be a driver that make food retailers want to join food delivery platforms. Second, as another possible driver to stimulate restaurants to join food delivery platforms is the possibility to exploit the food platform expertise in the automatized operations and the third possible driver might be the possibility to third -party the delivery operation through the platform. The packetization of services, which could be described as the possibility of use an automatized operation system to receive orders outsource the delivery, might be another driver that stimulate food retailers to join food delivery platforms. The drivers mentioned will be discussed and analyzed later in this paper.", "This paper is organized by the following structure: chapter 2 covers the Literature Review regarding the value created by platforms in supply chain s and describing the theor ies lens used in this research in order to analyze and answer the RQ. Chapter 3 covers the Methodology used in this research regarding the research design, data collection and how the interviews were designed. Chapter 4 addressed the analysis and its evaluation linking with the background theory explained in the chapter 2. Chapter 5 covers the conclusion and the summary of the results, limitations of this study and what could be addressed in Future Researches.", "CHAPTE R 2 – LITERATURE REVIEW", "2.1 Value Creation in the supply chain", "2.1.1 Traditional Business versus Platform Business", "In traditional markets , the concept of pipeline is quite common. The pipeline is considered a linear supply chain as it follows a s ingle path: the company produce and makes the product or service available in the market then, the customer buys. It is the system used by most companies to create and transfer value, with fixed places for producers and consumers. Incumbent business model s in retail are challenged by new competition and evolving consumer expectations as retail has increasingly moved online. New business models take advantage of digitalization and changing consumer expectations, requiring managers to understand and react to the changing retail landscape. (Hult et al., 2012) While traditional store labels participate in that shift via multichannel strategies, a significant chunk of the trade goes to new players. According to the Rocket Internet’s CEO, “ Stores only existed because the Internet hadn’t been invented.” (Hult et al., 2012) The shift from the traditional system to platform models has had numerous implications on business processes and outcomes by changing not only the form of interaction and consumption relatio nships, but the whole usual trading mindset. The platform model goes beyond the pipeline in many ways, for example when it eliminates intermediates in processes.", "Advancements in technology and communication gave space to the emerge nce of platforms inside the business landscape. Platforms business models goes beyond firms’ supply chain. It has changed the way firms interact in the ecosystems and spread value. In platform models, which work in a multilateral way, producers, consumers and even the tool establish a variable set of interactions and value exchanges. Platform business has been widely used to transform business process and activities and even to create entirely new business models and markets. (Hult et al., 2012) They are responsible to tran sform the nature of exchange in retail as platforms by linking consumers with independent supplier base, in other words, the marketplace. (Hult et al., 2012) The migration of competition from products to platforms -in technology and nontechnology industries alike – requires a different mindset for managing them. Managing platform -based business requires an entirely different mindset for strategy. (Tiwana, 2013) As a result, platform business has changed the way companies conduct their business and the way competition has been establish among players. Additionally, platforms enable to dramatically expand business possibilities, eliminating gatekeepers. Consequently, companies could exploit the opportunity to reduce costs and makes processes more tran sparent and agile, allowing for greater negotiation. Another highlight, comparing to the traditional business, platforms offers more interaction among parties, feedback and improvement points can be continuously evaluated and upgraded, generating benefits for all involved. In addition, companies are massively using data, as a powerful asset, and increasingly investing in their platforms using features such as Artificial Intelligence and Internet of Things (IoT), for instance - which could provide more accurate results.", "Furthermore, platforms change the logic for value creation in the supply chain . Value creation in platform ecosystems comes from the interaction between independent participants around the platform that together form an ecosystem. The difference between the traditionally platform ecosystem and the multisided digital platform is that the last one has a platform ecosystem that extends to include competitors that may form a secondary or complementary platform. (Hänninen et al., 2018) In sum, it means that instead of following a single path, value generation is created and can even be modified according to user demand. Where all users have active participation in processes, sometimes even performing different roles.", "Despite all tra nsformation in the business environment, the effects of the platform economy and platform -based business on the retail sector have received limited attention from academics so far. Recent research on retailing in the digital era has looked at topics such a s consumer engagement and interactivity in online retail channels. Although, just a few studies addressed the need for further enhancing managerial understanding of the unique business models and strategies of multisided platforms, especially because they have significant repercussions on the retail industry value chains. (Hänninen et al., 2018) Besides, the evolvability of platform business in unforeseeable ways is a key to thriving in platform markets but is rarely the dominant emphasis on academic resea rch (Tiwana, 2013) 2.1.2 The power of growth platforms in two side markets - how they create value for its users Emerging technologies are science -based innovations that are capable to transform an existing industry or creating a new one. Emerging techno logies include discontinuous technologies derived from radical innovations as well as more evolutionary technologies formed by the convergence of previously separate research streams. The term technology is used broadly in business and science to refer the process of transforming basic knowledge into useful application. The purposed of emerging technologies is to expand the knowledge base through the application in existing markets or in the creating of the new one. (Day & Schoemaker, 2000) Managing allia nces and other partnerships is one of the central activities in successfully developing and commercializing emerging technologies. Then, the structures of these relationships determine the payoffs from the process. (Day & Schoemaker, 2000) One of the bigg est mistakes that companies make is not paying adequate attention to the connections between them to the parent firm. Companies that do recognize this challenge can create formal coordinating mechanisms and structures to keep both parts of the organization s in the sync .(Day & Schoemaker, 2000) In this scenario, platforms took advantage of technologies advancements and could enhance their capability to provide to create an infrastructure and rules that facilitate transactions between two groups of users o r companies. (Eisenmann, Parker, & Alstyne, 2006) The definition of Platforms could be better explained in the statement below:", "“Platforms are powerful launching pads for new ideas, products, services and businesses. They help define and organize strateg ically relevant innovation activities and initiatives, and they are essential frameworks for focusing an organization toward true sustainable growth.” (Jonash, Koehler, & Onassis, 2007) Platforms are creating an entirely new blueprint for competition – one that puts ecosystems in head -to-head competition. They are transforming competition, in many industries and markets, from product and service to platform based. These transformations in the ecosystem are driven by 5 forces described below:", "1. Deepening Spec ialization: Increased need for deep expertise due to growing of complexity of products and services. The consequence is simultaneously shrinking and expanding firm boundaries.", "2. Packetization: Digitization of some processes. activities, product or service t hat was not previously digitized. The consequence is seeing as location -independent distribution ability of work and the company is capable of focus on their own core capabilities.", "3. Software embedding: Baking a routine business activity into software. As", "consequence, products to service transformation and convergence of adjacent industries.", "4. Ubiquitous networking : The growing omnipresence of cheap and fast wireless", "internet data networks. As consequence, loosely coupled networks rival efficiencies of firms, a lters who can participate from where, alters where services can be delivered, scale without ownership.", "5. Internet of Things (IoT): Ability to direct talk using an Internet protocol. As consequence, deluge of data streams from networked objects (Jonash et a l., 2007; Basically, platforms enable the company to connect the capabilities and assets of different organizational units and external partners. (Jonash et al., 2007; Tiwana, 2013) The potential power of platforms ecosystems comes from l everaging the unique expertise of many, which is impossible to replicate within a single organization. (Tiwana, 2013) Essentially, platforms throws the brainpower of thousands of small firms, mixes it with their hunger to succeed in the market and lets th e market determines the winners and losers. (Tiwana, 2013) When some companies discovered the power of growth platforms, which is a strategic link or anchor in a stream of growth and innovation opportunities that connects differentiated internal capabili ties (or capabilities that could be attained) with external market needs. (Jonash et al., 2007) The most compelling platforms are found at the intersection of unmet customer needs and distinct capabilities available to the firm. Many authors described so me steps to considered before the company join a platform and better exploit its opportunities and it is where they create value for its users:", "1. Develop a deep understanding of customer markets and identify new unmet market needs. In order to accomplish thi s, companies need to update their analytical toolkits, capabilities and processes for generating insights.", "2. Identify existing or potential internal capabilities and competencies. This requires that sophisticated processes and tools are developed and deploye d.", "3. Finding opportunities at the intersection of market needs and capabilities and clustering innovation opportunities around strategic platform 4. To do this, leaders need to look across their organization – across business units, geographies, and their comp any boundaries – for the right talent to lead and support growth platforms. Then leaders need to visibly drive platform initiatives. Platforms can face some of the biggest challenges from within their own organization. It is the attention and support of se nior leaders that will ensure their success.", "5. Investing in the innovation pipeline and executing on the strategic growth platforms and their opportunities. (Jonash et al., 2007; Tiwana, 2013) Furthermore, companies might have many benefits when join a p latform. They help to focus on company’s creative and analytical forces. They are an effective mechanism to both integrate innovation in business unit strategy and to anchor it in the structure of the organization. (Jonash et al., 2007) Although, it is w ell-known that growth platforms could also enable companies to be successful innovators and harvest the financial rewards over the long - run because companies could take advantage of factors such as networking effects and winner - takes all dynamics (Eisenman n et al., 2006; Jonash et al., 2007) . Networking effects has two sides. On one hand, networking effects could help business to increase returns on scale because users will pay more for access to a bigger network, so, margin improve as user base grows (Eisenmann et al., 2006) . On the other hand, fueled by the promise of increasing returns, competition in two -sides network industries could be fierce. (Eisenmann et al., 2006) Indeed, platform business incorporates both digital and physical busine sses (Hidding, Williams, & Sviokla, 2011) . Besides, platforms serve as a very tangible vehicle to drive cultural change in companies and even to redefine the perception of the company in the marketplace. (Jonash et al., 2007) The common denominator of all platforms is that they facilitate interactions between two distinct groups (or sides) that want to interact with and need each other (Tiwana, 2013) . One of the main gains to be part of a platform business, is that it collaborates to increase informa tion sharing among supply chain partners by sharing information regarding demand forecasts and production schedules, for instance. (Devaraj et al., 2007) (Jonash et al., 2007) Moreover, they are an effective way to communicate the long -term strategic pri orities and growth prospects to investors and employees. And when a company manages a portfolio of platforms effectively, the result is sustained growth and success in the marketplace (Day & Schoemaker, 2000) .", "2.1.3 The challenges facing by food retail ers in the Sharing Information era", "The business environment is a competitive arena where companies fight to survive. In order to stay alive, they have to keep consumers´ expectations high by attending their needs and offering products with speedy delivery .(Hult et al., 2012; Kumar & Pugazhendhi, 2012; Lotfi, Mukhtar, Sahran, & Zadeh, 2010; Marinagi, Trivellas, & Reklitis, 2015; Wu, Chuang, & Hsu, 2014) . On one side, consumers are more demanding and expecting customized products and services with high qua lity in less time. On the other side, companies are trying to improve their operations to attend consumers’ needs in order to stay competitive in the market. Consequently, to achieve their quality standards, they acknowledge the importance of integrate and coordinate supply chain activities through information sharing. Therefore, information sharing serves as an essential approach for enabler of supply chain integration and achieve performance goals. (Lotfi et al., 2010) According to Frohlich et al (2001) , there are many previous studies that suggests that the high level of integration with suppliers and customers could lead to better performance results.", "Many studies have already addressed the materials flow between suppliers and customers. According t o Hult (2012), supply chain is traditionally viewed as a material or production system, even though is equally valuable to see as an information processing and interpretation system as well. However, it is very recent that studies start to present the impo rtance of sharing information among members of the supply chain and its high correlation with firms increasing their performance. (Lotfi et al., 2010) In this scenario, companies start to understand and acknowledge the importance of information sharing i n supply chains, which it is noticeable that has become more efficient by the global introduction of long -term cooperation and coordination. As a result of, it leads ultimately to the improvement of companies' competitive advantages. (Lotfi et al., 2010; M arinagi et al., 2015; Wu et al., 2014) Technological advancements in information and communication provided tools to make this integration attainable for companies. (Liu, Wei, Ke, Wei, & Hua, 2016; Lotfi et al., 2010; Marinagi et al., 2015; Wu et al., 2014; Yu, Ting, & Chen, 2010) A lot of tools emerged on the market to facilitate the information sharing. One classical example is the ERP (enterprise resource planning), which integrates information regarding demand, finance, warehouse with all m embers of the organization. There are many types of internally and externally information that could be shared by the company. So, it could be classified as: strategic or tactical; logistical or pertaining to consumers. Each type of shared information cou ld provide a potential benefit for the company. (Kumar & Pugazhendhi, 2012) Although, share information it is not a simple task for companies.", "First, previous studies acknowledge that not all firms could benefit from information sharing. Some parties c ould obtain different benefits of sharing information which, sometimes, could be a factor that influence supply chain partners to not share their own information. (Kumar & Pugazhendhi, 2012) Because of unbalanced gains, companies who gain the most benefit s give trading partners incentives in order to balance the benefits between them. There are still few studies that evaluate the effectiveness of this mechanism and no evidence that make companies start to collaborate. (Kumar & Pugazhendhi, 2012) Furtherm ore, company’s culture plays a big role regarding information sharing. Many authors mentioned that the willingness to share information comes from company’s culture values and this sharing behavior must be embedded inside the organization. (Fawcett, Oster haus, Magnan, Brau, & McCarter, 2007) Even though, the statement “ The information is power ” is still true in the business arena. This idea plays against information sharing and collaboration. Thus, managers could feel demotivated to share important infor mation among their supply chain partners specially if they feel that could become a potential threat. Therefore, trust and collaboration are only built when companies are willing to share vital information in order to perform better.", "Second, to unlock thi s capability, it requires high upfront investments in technological tools and systems. (Hult et al., 2012; Kumar & Pugazhendhi, 2012; Marinagi et al., 2015) These tools are customized designed to share all information across the company’s areas attending their specific needs. The main goal of those systems is to provide the right information delivered to the right people at the right time in order to support managers during the decision -making process. (Hult et al., 2012) One implication is as much cust omized is the tool, as more expensive to buy and complex to implement. So, because of this issue, IT companies decided to develop standard versions of information systems that could be used in a wide variety of companies. On one hand, those standard tools might lack on efficiency to provide the right information or the right people. (Devaraj, Krajewski, & Wei, 2007) On the other hand , some companies overspend to acquire the most advanced, and usually the most expensive, technology at the market when modes t ones can better meet existing needs (Fawcett et al., 2007) .", "Third, regarding the implementation of an information technology system, it might lead to another problem. If the information technology tool were not designed to fulfill the sp ecific needs to the organization’s strategy, the information delivered could be inadequate, insufficient or even irrelevant for managers which could overwhelm them with a heavy flow of useless information. (Fawcett et al., 2007) According to Hult (2012), “The flow of information has a curvilinear link with the outcomes, being described as where an inflection point can be reach at which dealing with more information is overwhelming”. On one hand, inadequate or insufficient information sharing limits an org anization´s expertise to leverage. For instance, this information, if well managed, could respond quickly to customer changes creating an advantage for inter -related companies. On the other hand, the excess of information sharing could overwhelm managers who could implicates in a bad decision making. Consequently, the lack of information sharing as well as the overwhelming information sharing results in inefficiency of coordinating actions within units in the company or organization (Lotfi et al., 2010) . Indeed, information technology has vast potential to facilitate collaborative planning among supply chain partners by sharing information on demand forecasts, providing real -time information regarding product availability, inventory levels, sh ipment status and product requirements. The outcomes of those inputs could impact important decisions such as market positioning, the perception of shifts in the consumer behavior, adjusting production and inventory levels, which could enhance companies’ s trategy, performance and the creation of value for customers (Fawcett et al., 2007) . Despite of some firms have successfully integrated technologies into their business models, others still struggle with this implementation which implies that if the comp any cannot have the capabilities to exploit the opportunities create in this implementation, they will be unable to improve their performance and leverage (Devaraj et al., 2007; Fawcett et al., 2007) .", "However, i nformation sharing alone is not c apable to improve company’s performance. Managers use information sharing as a resource to help them to interpret the business environment in order to obtain knowledge. This knowledge acquired will serve to drive decisions and develop strategies for the b usiness. The basis of better management is in the challenge to translate information into knowledge, which make information -processing activities very tied to firm’s performance. So, it is important to clarify the difference between information sharing a nd information processing. (Hult et al., 2012) According to the book “The theory of the growth of the firm” discussed deeper later in this paper, a firm´s rate of growth is limited by the growth of knowledge within it. So, the firm expands through exploi ting it unused managerial services, the so -called managerial limits to expansion. In order to expand, it is fundamental to increase experience of managers that could be developed in two ways – changes in knowledge acquired and changes in ability to use kno wledge. (Penrose, 1959) Nevertheless , under uncertainty, managers could find difficulties to acquire and use knowledge to make decisions. Uncertainty is an obstacle to implement information sharing, transparency, and ultimately collaboration among firms. It could be understood as the root cause of information processing needs. The information processing theory (IPT) is concerned with the link between environmental uncertainty and a firm´s information processing needs, as well as with the question how firms can cope with these needs (Busse, Meinlschmidt, & Foerstl, 2017) . Thus, the difference between the amount of information required to perform the task and the amount of information already possessed by the organization it is the focus of this the ory. (Teece, Gary, & Shuen, 1997)", "2.2 Information Processing Theory", "Information Processing Theory (IPT) was evolved in the 1970s with an intraorganizational focus, in response to organizational design problems of large firms. IPT encompasses the gathe ring, interpreting, and synthesizing of information .(Hult et al., 2012) IPT posits that firms must achieve fit between information processing needs and their own information processing capacity to foster performance. On the other hand, this misalignment impairs performance. In striving for fit, the organization must adopt a strategy to either reduce the information necessary to coordinate activities or to increase its capacity to process more information or apply a combination of both strategies. (Busse et al., 2017) As a contingency -type theory, IPT assumes that the external business environment is rather inert, whereas the internal firm process is relatively more adaptable. IPT refers to information processing mechanisms aimed at the creation of additional information processing capacity, such as investments in suitable information systems, as well as at firm -internal coordination mechanism supposed to mitigate the effects of uncertainty on information processing needs. Instead of modifying its ow n structure and processes, the organization can attempt to modify its environment. It is important to investigate whether firms adapt their business environments to their sustainability related need in order to facilitate the further evolution of informati on processing theory, but also to foster the impact on their supply chain management (SCM) . (Busse et al., 2017) The goal of SCM is that optimizing value -creating activities across organizations may generate more value than the individual firms coul d create on their own. Transparency and information sharing between the supply chain partners foster such collaboration. (Busse et al., 2017) Consequently, it is important for companies articulating the confluence between materials/products and informatio n within the SCM context. Furthermore, it is not just an opportunity to assess just knowledge but also to exploit a valuable opportunity to use knowledge created. (Hult et al., 2012) Knowledge acquisition activities enhance each supply chain node´s knowle dge flows. Since productive knowledge is embodied, it cannot be accomplished by information sharing. Companies acquire knowledge through their own cycle learning of trying to improve their core competences and develop their own capabilities. Consequently, according to Hult (2012), “ the more knowledge acquisition activities are emphasized, the greater knowledge flows grow, and the more outcomes can improve .” Thus, as much information sharing translated into knowledge a company could create more valuable oppo rtunities for its business.", "Indeed, previous studies have frequently applied IPT as a theoretical lens to explain various phenomena such as the value of internal and external supply chain integration. (Busse et al., 2017) . IPT will be an inter esting approach to understand the value created by platforms to members of supply chain in a food industry by using the interconnection of information flow in order to access and create internal knowledge . IPT is an interesting lens that could be complemen ted with other theory that provide s an understand of how those platforms could enhance supplier´s internal capabilities generating a competitive advantage for them . In the next section of this present paper, Resource -Based View theory (RBV ) explains how co mpanies could exploit internal resources in order to gain a competitive advantage in the market.", "2.3 Resource Based View Theory (RBV)", "One fundamental question regarding strategy is how organizations achieve and sustain competitive advantage. Many t heories emerged trying to explain it through hypothesis and frameworks considering aspects such as competition, price and performance rivalry, innovation and existing competences. Authors such as Michael Porter and Edith Penrose develop interesting approac hes regarding companies’ competences and how they influence the creation and the sustenance of the competitive advantage. Despite those approaches are quite different in terms of their perspectives, it is important to provide information regarding both to prove why one was chosen for this proposed research instead of the other.", "The Theory of the Growth of the company published in 1959 from Edith Penrose is the book which originated the resource -based view of the firm theory. Many proponents of this theory were researches such as Jay Barney with his published work “ Firm resources and Sustained competitive advantage” and Birger Wernerfeld with his work “ The resource -based view of the firm”. Moreover, this theory was the basis of other theories that c ome from posteriorly such as the Resource orchestration -based theory and dynamic capabilities theory (Teece et al., 1997) The resource -based view theory (RBV) is based on the notion that firm´s performance is founded on this unique tangible and in tangible resources – assets, processes, skills, information, knowledge, etc - that are hard to imitate, such as resource heterogeneity and immobility. When these resources are combined, they create Business Capabilities some of which, either individually, or in combination, create a set of Core Competencies , that provide a sustainable competitive advantage to the firm. (Penrose, 1959) Every organization has a set of core competences and weaknesses that distinguish one organization from the other. The refore, what firms could do is not only exploit the opportunities that it appears, but also to maximize their gains depends on the abilities they can muster. (Teece et al., 1997) For instance, previous studies have shown that the ability of a firm to dev elop and exploit new technologies and organizational processes, including e -business capabilities, will lead to sustainable competitive advantages. (Devaraj et al., 2007) Although, according to RBV, firms are being profitable not because they engage in st rategic investments, such as e -business tools, that may raise prices above the long -run costs, but because they have the ability to have lower costs align with the offering of high quality products or services. The influence of the RBV has also been incre asing in prominence in the operations management area. Some have argued that the operations area is at the heart of developing organizational capabilities that create competitive advantage. (Mcivor, 2009) The development of capabilities is strongly influe nced by competitive priorities, such as cost, quality, flexibility and delivery, which are the organization’s operational strategy. (Mcivor, 2009) Moreover, in order to create competitive advantage, companies must anticipate shifts in the industry. Some valuable resources in a previous industry setting may be a weakness or even useless in a new industry setting. Companies cannot expect gain sustainable advantage when resources are evenly distributed among firms and highly mobile . (Barney, 1991) In order to hold a competitive advantage companies should have resources that are valuable, in the sense that it exploit opportunities or neutralize threats, resources should be rare among firms of the same industry and competitors, resources should be imperf ectly imitable and cannot have any strategically equivalent for this. (Barney, 1991) Indeed, resources and capabilities are valuable assets because they could allow the organization to exploit opportunities and counter threats in the business enviro nment. (Teece et al., 1997) This approach focuses on firms -specific resources rather than the economic profits from product market positioning. As expected, company´s success or its future development lies in the ability to find and create a competence t hat is truly distinctive in the market. (Penrose, Many researches already addressed the theme of how to develop a strategy to build a competitive advantage. Some of them have different approaches such as Porter´s five forces and RBV. The diff erence between Penrose and Porter´s views are while the first focuses on solely within the firm , the second lies on the context that the firm is inserted. The theory developed by Porter determines how capabilities and endowments companies develop their competitive advantage lies as much in the environment as in an individual firm. His proposed theory claims that the environment shapes how activities are configured, how resources are assembled uniquely and what partnerships could be successfully made. (M. P orter, 1991) A comparison of the resource -based approach and the competitive forces approach in terms of their implications for the strategy process is revealing. One major difference among both approaches is that according to Porter´s perspective, the pr ocess of identifying and developing the requisite assets is not particularly problematic while according to the resource -based perspective, firms are heterogeneous with respect of their resources, capabilities and endowments. Further resources endowments a re sticky, at least in the short -run, firms are to some degree stuck with what they have and may have to live with what they lack. However, Porter believes that if a capability is not already possessed by the firm, it could be easily be acquired. (Teece e t al., 1997) For the following study, RBV would provide the lens to analyze the problem that will be discussed carefully in the next chapter. RBV could be an interesting perspective to understand the reasons why food providers want to enter, stay or leave food platforms. Because RBV has a focus on firms developing certain abilities internally in order to sustain or build their competitive advantage, it could assistance to understand important implications regarding which activities companies should internalize, and which ones should be outsourced by the platforms, for instance. (Mcivor,2009) Furthermore, by analyzing companies’ internal capabilities we aim to understand: If food providers could be able to adapt and create a competitive advantage to sustain their business in this new environment when they engage in a food platform.", "2.4 RB V and IPT as the basis for research", "Platforms interconnect players and it is a powerful tool to exchange information among parties, access knowledge and enha nce companies‘ ability to process information in order to create their own knowledge. The potential to explore their own internal capabilities in order to create a competitive advantage, it is well -known explain by RBV theory (Barney, 1991; Penrose, 1959; Teece et al., 1997) The influence of the RBV has also been increasing in prominence in the operations management area. Some have argued that the operations area is at the heart of developing organizational capabilities that create competitive advantage. (Mcivor, 2009) The development of capabilities is strongly influenced by competitive priorities, such as cost, quality, flexibility and delivery, which are the organization’s operational strategy. (Mcivor, 2009) While, the ability to collect and process ing information in order to create knowledge or a competence it is well -known explained by IPT (Busse et al., 2017; Hult et al., 2012) . Both presented theories go along and could help explain the phenomenon we aim to study. Previous studies believe that the application of RBV to IPT contexts has the potential to identify key drivers of superior business performance. (Wade & Hulland, 2004) The use of RBV required the introduc tion of new considerations that should be consider during researches. First , resources definitions must be narrowed in order to help fine -tune the understanding of specific resources and their effect in competitive position and performance given setting. This caution is because resources´ definition could be misunderstood or ha ve a dual interpretation by the interviewee which could lead to difficulties to interpret and generalize results to new contexts or potentially relevant resources can quickly put away for practical research use. Second, when mixed both theories, IPT and RBV, and because of the nature of RBV, that is related to sustain the competitive advantage , needs to put an information in a time perspective or using a baseline as a comparison parameter. For instance, in the question “what were the gains to join a food delivery platform? “, the interviewee could respond a gain of % of market share, sales, and so o n. Indeed, b oth of theories are complementary for this study and provide important insights for th is proposed research.", "This research aims to answer the fol lowing question: “ Why food providers want to join food delivery platforms?” We could previously infer that are some drivers that influence food retailers to join food delivery platforms. The table below previously identify some of the drivers we want to an alyze in this study, because we believe that might justify why food retailers adhere to food delivery platforms :", "Table 1- Drivers to join food delivery platforms Theory Construct Possible Drivers of the research supported by the Li terature Information Processing Theory Information capacity Grow customer base and access information Resource Based View Valuable Outsource Operations - Delivery Resource Based View Valuable Reduce operational Costs Resource Based View Valuable Operat ion Automatization Resource Based View Valuable Increase Revenue Information Processing Theory Information capacity Learning with the platform´s expertise in operations", "Based in the table above, this study interview s food retailers and develop the future analysis of those drivers.", "CHAPTER 3 – METHODOLOGY 3.1 Research Design", "This study is an exploratory and qualitative research. It aims to understand the impact of the food delivery platforms used by food providers . In order to conduct a more thorough investigation of how online food platforms could benefit food providers by enhancing their internal capabilities, it is essential to gather data from restaurant operators themselves to learn about their goals and understand how they perceiv e the impact of join a food delivery platform. A better way to conduct such research is through the exploratory method of investigation. Because of the characteristics of this research, the qualitative method that is best applied when research addresses de scriptive or explanatory questions and aims to prod uce a first -hand understanding of people and events (Yin, 2014) .", "3.2 Data Collection", "In order to gather information to progress with this proposed study, interviews were held with 15 owner and mana gers of small and medium size restaurants located in the second biggest economic city in Brazil. Rio de Janeiro was chosen as a location to develop this research because Rio is the second economic biggest city in Brazil and is a worldwide megalopolis with almost 1 5 million urban citizens (IBGE, 2019) . Besides, Rio de Janeiro is one of the 50th cities with the highest PIB in the world. Moreover, Rio is worldwide famous touristic city which receives millions of Brazilian citizens and foreign tourists every year, potentialize during some seasons, such as summer, as well as important events , such as Carnival and music festivals. Both urban citizens and tourists are potential users of delivery food apps which, according to a study dev elop by the platform leader , generates more than 2 million orders per month just on this platform.", "Indeed, b ecause of the characteristic of the city , Rio de Janeiro is an interesting location to do this research because it is easier to compare to oth ers megalopolis around the world and could serve as basis for future researches . Furthermore, the impact food delivery platforms are generating in people´s lives and changing their consumer preferences needs a further investigation on the impacts generated at the supplier side.", "In order to develop the research and gather data, the interviews were structure using a questionnaire with open questions based on the proposed theoretical lens used in this study . The questionnaire was used as a framework to exp lore the adoption and implementation decisions during the interviews with restaurant´s owners and managers.

The research question was based to understand the reasons to why they adhere to food delivery platforms, continue using it or leave the platform. Basically, we were interested to understand the relevant factors t hat influence them to join, stay or leave platforms and the impact of the adherence to their business.", "However, after the first interviews, we noticed that was important to also interview restaurants that do not use food delivery platforms in order to avoid biases and fulfill possible gaps in the research. Moreover, could be interesting to compare answers based on both perspectives for a better understanding of the problem. In order to interview restaurants that do not use food delivery platforms, we adapt the questionnaire´s questions for those who do not use food delivery platforms in their operations to understand their perspective regarding the business and this choice. Indeed, after data gathering and consolidation, it was possible to make bette r analysis because we have data of both perspectives which also become this research more relevant.

Some of restaurants of the sample h ave more than 20 years old and, of course, back then food delivery apps did not exist. In order to build their operations, the restaurant must design it considering the basic structure: rent a place , design their own production operations (receive orders, prepare, delivery food, payment , and so on ), hire staff, promote the restaurant , everything by their own. Additionally, if they decide to receive orders by phone or website, they must also implement the delivery operation and hire staff to delivery orders to customers . All activities previously described requires expertise in many areas of the business (marketing, delivery, operations and so on…) and, consequently, those activities have been developed and improved by those mature restaurants all over the ye ars.", "After the implementation of food delivery apps in this sector, we could observe changes in the business model and movements towards the digital business model . First case, some restaurants that already exists decided to adapt their operations i n order to add the use of food delivery platforms. Second case is when restaurants that already existed in the market , as local neighborhood store , for instance , decide to close the local store and only operates through food delivery platforms. Third possi ble case is when restaur ants emerged in the market because of the possibility to join food delivery platforms in order to enter in the food business. The fourth case is whe n restaurant decides to maintain the original business model and not join any food platform.", "In our sample , we were able to observe that mostly of younger restaurants are adepts of second or third case while mature age restaurants tends to adhere to the first or fourth options. During the interviews, owners of younger restaur ants that have local store tends to adhere to food delivery platforms expecting gains with incremental revenue and access to a customer network . The most common quote used by them during the interview s was: “We opened the business mostly because of the po ssibility to the use of food delivery platforms . Among other reasons, the possibility to promote the business to a huge customer network and to generate additional revenue for our restaurant ”. Additionally, another benefit provided by platforms was the po ssibility to the owners test the product or the business model before they decide to open a local store. Another owner mentioned that because of the platform he was able to test his product before they make an investment to open a local store, “We were abl e to test our product and see how the sales goes during some sort of the time. Besides we had the chance to organize our operation, evaluate costs, competitors and better perform before we opened the local store. This trial was essential for us to decide to open a local store”.", "Furthermore, we analyzed some examples of restaurant´s owners that decided to close their local store and only operate through food platform. During the interview, he explained that because of the high fixed costs he used to have with a local store and the growth in the number of orders through the delivery platform, he decided to have a lean operation by only using the platform in his business. “ When we decided to use food delivery platform in the restaurant, we join it mostly because our competitors were using it , after some time our revenue through the platform were more than 70% of our total revenue. That was the reason we decided to close the operation at the store and stay only with the food platform. The advantages: we could reduce our operational costs and have more flexibility to open the restaurant only in the hours that we think is more relevant for us.” Since food delivery arrived in the ecosystem it makes possible for entrepreneurs or restaurant´s ow ners of the food industry have access to a huge customer network which could leverage sales and rise the scalability of the business. In some cases, it is possible to start in this industry with lower investments than if needs to open a store. Moreover, pl atforms have an expertise in the business in some areas , such as marketing or delivery, that younger or unexperienced entrepreneur s still not have and could help at the beginning of the business. Those are few reasons that make owners change or adapt their business model for one that includes the platform business model.", "However, even with all advantages to join a platform described above why some restaurants decided to not use them in their operations? What are the gains they see in their busines s not joining a food platform ? At first sight , the restaurants that decided to not use food delivery platforms seems to be resistant to adhere to new technologies such as food delivery platforms and to the change s in the business environment. What the adva ntages of not join a platform have they seen that younger and enthusiastic entrepreneurs are not seen? These questions were raised during the interviews and demonstrated that was not enough to understand the problem and try to answer the research question looking only through the perspective of the restaurants that are adepts of food delivery platforms .", "The typical profile of the ones that do not use food delivery platforms could be described as following : most of the traditional restaurants intervi ewed for this research have more than 10 years old and a loyal customer base. Moreover, because of the time and experience they have in the business and the inexistence of platforms when they start, they had to understand and operate in each area of the bu siness and of course they gained experience on those. Besides, all interviewed have their own delivery operation established or already outsourced this activity for lower costs than if they use through the platforms. Even though, their biggest concern to enter in the platforms is the relationship with the customer: “We are in this business almost for 20 years, our growth is organic, basically we grow our customer base through mouth -to-mouth, our customers are very loyal to the restaurant and keep them close to us make us understand the business and see what we could do better for them.” – said the owner of one of the interviewed restaurants. Another testimony was “For us, join a platform doesn´t make sense for our business. We work with customized products for our clients we need to be in touch with them to really understand their need. Unfortunately, platforms doesn´t support that kind of interaction with your customer and according with some other entrepreneurs that use it, you do not have too much informa tion (age, gender, preferences, address, so on…) regarding your customer. ” Indeed, there is more complexity in the decision to adhere or not to food delivery platforms . Many factors could impact in the owner´s decision to join or not food delivery pla tforms. T his study aims to go through over some of the se factors that was mentioned during the interviews in order to found out the impacts of th is in the business.", "4.2.2. Resource Based View", "As previously mentioned in this paper, Resource based view theory aims to understand the internal distinguish competences of an organization that make them sustain their competitive advantage. So , during the interviews, we collect information regarding food reta iler´s internal competences that make them stand o ut in this fierce market. The most frequent answers w ere related to the following characteristics: Price – “Our product aligns quality and price and it has the best cost- benefit t hat our target consumers could get.” Quality of the product – “ As the rest aurant’s proposition, we value use the best products in our dishes, in order to achieve the tastiest healthy food that it is something that our customers are looking for.” Variety of the menu – “ In our restaurant , we have more than 1000 receipts . Every da y we serve a different type of dish available for our customers . It is always a surprise for them.” . Another resta urant mentioned about variety and customization – “ Our client finds in our restaurant the possibility to create the dish (salad) the way they want. This is the difference in our restaurant; our customer could order from different channels and have a customized meal exactly the way they One of the challenges of join food delivery platform s is to consider those internal capabili ties, as an important tool to keep the competitive ness in this market . The challenges when they adhere to food delivery platforms are to adapt and enhance those abilities through the platform , especially because they increase the number of sales and reach new clients . Many food retailers face difficulties to adapt their special and distinguish abilities using food delivery platforms and that is one of the drivers that they decide to not to adhere to it. In the following, this study is going to expose the i mpacts and the challenges faced by food retailers to keep their internal competences when they decided to use or not food delivery platforms. It will be analyzed the internal competences mentioned by them during in the interviews and described previously : price, quality of the product, variability and customization.", "The impact of Operations ‘costs in the products ‘price and quality Some restaurants need to adapt their internal process and operations in order to adhere to food delivery platforms. Whe n restaurants , that already operate in other platforms or in a store, decide to join food delivery platforms, they must adapt their operations to support the implementation of one more channel and deal with the increase of the volume of sales. Food deliver y platforms brings facilitat ion in the implementation because of the characteristic called packetization , mentioned in the literature, when activities are easily conducted in a friendly user application. During the interviews, some owners explained how the y integrate the restaurant operations in the food delivery platform . To exemplified , in the study we identif ied three different cases described in the following .", "In the first case scenario, before the opening, the restaurant already planned to use f ood delivery platforms together with the store: “Before the restaurant´s opening, we´ve already have in mind we will join food delivery platforms, then when we built our operations, we already considered its volume of orders and how we will manage both op erations (store and delivery ) together.”. The advantage to be in this situation is because the owner could decide how they are going to slip costs considering both operations, in store and delivery. Moreover, they previously planned the size of the operati ons ( kitchen, staff, so on) to attend both channels. In the second case scenario , it could be described when the restaurant just operate s through food delivery platforms: “Food delivery platforms facilitates to open a new business because of the easiest way to conduct activities : ´packetization which enable owners/ managers to integrate their business to a friendly user application facilitating daily operations, such as delivery, marketing and so on. For us, food delivery platforms were responsible to create opportunities for new businesses because platforms made it possible to open a business with lower capital than before.” One deepest analysis of this testimonial, might explain ed some reasons behind this drive : owners who just want to operate th rough platforms decide to join because they could exploit the expertise of operations , which the platforms offer , while they could just focus in the core business, prepare the food.", "On one hand, this could be one of the drivers that make owners j oin food delivery platforms. On the other hand, this rule cannot be generalized to all cases as an example described as following in the third case scenario. When the restaurant has already set up their operation in a store and do not use or previously planned to use food delivery platforms , it is more complicated than the other cases to set up their operation to join platforms. Unless, they already have infrastructure to support an additional volume of sales coming from the platform this implementation will not be difficult as if they need to implement other changes. However, if it is not the case, when those restaurants decide to join food delivery platforms, most of them have a lot of work to do in order to provide the infrastructure required to suppo rt an additional channel of sales. Most of the interviewed restaurants that belong to this profile mentioned “When we decided to join food delivery platforms, we had to expand our kitchen´s operation to receive more orders and had to change some of our ope rations in order to separate orders coming from delivery and the store. Adhere to the platforms was initially costly then the strategy we adopted was to use different menus with different prices for customer from the delivery and the ones from the store. W e had to transfer some of the platform costs to them in order to pay off some of the extra expenses we have to sell through it.”. Another restaurant mentioned tha t “ we couldn´t transfer all costs coming from the platform to our clients. Because if doing s o, our product will become less competitive.” Many food retailers that increase their operations ´costs when they adhere to food delivery platforms transfer some of those additional costs for the product´s final price. Many of them said in the inter views that they use menus with different price tags between the store and the delivery. It is a risky strategy once the food market is very price sensitive. In the interviews, some food retailers mentioned that they adopted this strategy in their business “ We had to add some of the operational costs to the products we sell through the platform. Our restaurant operates with different menus - one for the store, other for delivery - We increase around 30% to 40% of the price, it depends on the product .” Furthermore, when it relates to establish a price to your product , it should be considered costs involved in the production and margin. Because the food market is a very price sensitive market, restaurants must be aware of costs in order to have better pr ices and be more competitive. When they decide to join food delivery platforms, in some cases described above, these operational costs could raise, in order to keep the same margin, some of restaurants decided to not transfer platform costs to their custom ers instead they change the quality of the product because they start to use cheaper products in order to decrease costs. In the following testimonial, the owner decides to not join food delivery platforms because of the importance for them to provide good quality of food to their customers :“ Our ticket in the restaurant is already above the average, when compare to self -service restaurants. However, we are in the niche of the market and it is a reasonable price for good quality healthy food. We didn´t want to have different price tags just because we are using the food delivery platforms. If we decide to adhere to it, we feel that we are “fooling” our customers. Besides, we grew over the years because of our reputation of good quality and taste food, we don ´t want to compromise that using low quality products.”. When restaurants decide to change their quality in order to increase the sales through the platform, it is a risky strategy. If quality is one of the core competences that make the restaurant gets mo re sales, it could compromise the restaurants reputation and could have a reverse result. 4.3 Information sharing in food delivery platforms - Is it an ad vantage ?", "4.3.1 Wh ich information are (really) shar ed with restaurants", "According to the inform ation processing theory (IPT) mentioned in th is study, the process to gather i nformation and how companies proces s it in order to generate knowledge it is crucial to guarantee the continued improvement of the business and , consequently, the sustainable growth. Therefore , this study previously believed that companies also decided to join food delivery platforms because they want to exploit the opportunity to have access to a customer network and to its information. In practice it does not happen . Food retail ers that use food delivery platforms have restricted information regarding the customer that reach them by food delivery platforms .", "Surpris ingly, this study previously believed that because food retailers would reach new clients , they could exploit t he opportunity to better understand their preferences and be able to evolve their internal capabilities to meet the demand of their customers. Although, food retailers have less information regarding their customer through platforms than if they decide to attend them without platforms. On one hand, o ne of the cons of the use food delivery platforms is because food ret ailers have almost none information regarding their customer which difficult the process to make them loyal to the brand and the process to study and understand what competences should evolve to attend this demand. According to the interviews held with owners of those establishments, they explicit tha t, in order to not lose this important information of their customers, they start to offer bette r promotions for those who order directly from restaurant in order to gather the information regarding the customer and try to retain them in the customer database . According to one of owners , he explicit in his testimonial: “ Our restaurant´s clients we k now the ir preferences and which meals are preferable to offer each day in the week and they participated in our customer loyalty program different of what occurs with the food platform´s clients that we have to make strategies to try to gather the informa tion regarding this client . In my restaurant, when a client orders through platform we send a flyer that inform if they order next time directly with the restaurant, we will give a discount , which could be free delivery or discount on the product.” Anothe r testimonial described the same strategy adopted in another restaurant : “ One disadvantage to the use of food delivery platforms is because we don´t know anything about the client we are serving . On one hand we reach new clients but on the other hand we l ose information regarding our potential consumers. In the restaurant we develop ways to collect this information, but it is not much efficient which make us more dependent to the platform.” On the other hand, food retailers that do not use food delivery platforms in this research have their competitive advantages more focus on customer -centric such as variability or customization of products and quality in the customer service, for instance. For th ese food retailers, food delivery platfo rms do not meet the ir needs because of limited information regarding their customers that are essential for them to exploit their competitive advantage. Information such as gender, social class, address, how often this customer order and which kind of product they usually order . For food retailers that provide customized products and need to interact with the client to provide the right product, food delivery platform does not attend their needs once t hey have limited communication with the client. This dif ference makes this study conclude that as more customer -centric is the restaurant less are the chance s to join food delivery platforms .", "4.3.2 Impacts in the decision -making process", "Another disadvantage o f the use of food delivery platforms is also related to the lack of available information to the restaurants and how much it impacts in the decision -making process. Because restaurants have few information regarding the customers reached through the platform , as more dependent the business become to the platform more difficult is the decision -making process. Some restaurants reported difficulties when they have to make decisions related to growth , for instance one restaurant interviewed reported: “We (the restaurant) wanted to open another store in another neig hborhood in Rio. Although, we have many questions regarding which one was the best to choose . We considered few criteria’s: we prefer to choose a neig hborhood that we find few competitors and close to potential customers, this last information we do not have. In order to solve this problem, we hire a service provided by the platform (B2B) , which is a consulting for restaurants, they understand our problem and make recommend ations for us. It is not include d in what we already pay for them, it is an optional service can hire .” Indeed, we could conclude by the testimonials that food delivery platforms do not intend to share information with food providers , and they value and monetized the information they hold. Looking at the platform strat egy, they develop ways to keep food providers close and locked int his system even though they give up of relevant aspects such as information, ability to learn in the process and be able to make decision s and t he proximity with their potential customers.", "4.3.3 Dependence on purpose – How does it affect sustainable growth?", "Moreover , the questionnaire in this study asked owners regarding the ir dependence relationship with food delivery platforms . In the sample chosen for this study , only one restaurant does not have more than 50% of their total revenue coming from the food platform. It shows the dependence of the business to the food platform. This dependence also is one factor that some restaurants decided to not join food delivery platforms, “ We are afraid to lose control of our business because if everything are comi ng through the platform we will have the feeling that we are serving them and not our customers.” Another owner raised the factor of sustainable growth in the answer, “Today we understan d the factors that would make us grow in the long run. For 20 years , we are growing, and this was possible because our hard work and the relationship we developed with our customers. We understand that all services provided by the platform we could do in t he house , which reasonable makes no sense for us to join them. We are afraid if we join the food platform, we will have the feeling that we are growing while we are not. We value our organic growth.” Those relevant aspects raised many questions reg arding the sustainable growth. The testimonial above mentioned organic vs inorganic growth while we could understand as a sustainable growth in the long run. This is not the purposed of this study and it requires another deep study to understand this aspe ct in the firms who use food delivery platforms. However, some questions in the questionnaire a sks the restaurant´s owners their perceptions regarding the restaurant´s sustainable growth using or not food delivery platforms and their dependence vs indepen dence relationship with food delivery platforms. Most of them have clue regarding the dependence of their business to the food delivery platforms, especially , when they answer that they will run out of business if food delivery platforms decided to shut operations . The words “Collapse” and “Bankruptcy” were the most use to answer this question. Although, none of those owners have clue regarding their growth. “The growth through food delivery platforms it is a little bit blur. We just measure through number of orders, but we do not know our clients very well .” This statement shows that even owners do not understand if their growth are sustainable or not in the long run , but they demonstrate considered growth if they are increasing number of orders. Our study did not collect ed information to answer this aspect and this is not the purposed of this study. The matter of sustainable growth in food business that use food delivery platforms need s further investigation.", "CHAPTER 5 – Conclusion 5.1 Conc lusion", "This study was conducted based on two theories , Resource Based View and Information Processing theory. The decision to choose those theories was because both are aligned with how companies acquire and manage their internal capabilities in order to sustain competitive advantage and growth . Resource based view (RBV) theory fulfill the importance to look at internal competences while Information Processing theory ( IPT) presents the importance to have access to information to create and develop kno wledge. Inside this context, the purposed of this study aims to understand why food providers decide to join food delivery platforms. In the previous chapter, we presented many drivers, which were mentioned in the literature and supported by the th eories chosen, that could influence food retailers to join or not food delivery platforms. During the research field, this study interview 15 food retailers that use and not use food delivery platform in their restaurants in order to understand their motiv es regarding food delivery platforms. As we understand based in the research field held with owners and restaurant´s managers, some of this decision drivers varies according to the type of business plan the restaurant adopted while others are the sam e for all restaurants . Furthermore , in the results of the research we found out some of the pros and cons on each driver observed . In order to summarize our research finding, the table below explains the pros and cons of each driver studied: Table 3 - Pros and Cons of Drivers found in the field research Drivers mentioned by food retailers Pros Cons Grow customer base Reach new clients which could increase the volume of sales However, does not have any information regarding custo mers which make it difficult identify customer needs and develop competences to sustain growth Implement delivery Operation through the food delivery platform Satisfy the customer demand attending for convenience Increase the operational costs which could unviable the product in the market Incremental Revenue Increase the volume of orders It is not only incremental; it become most of the revenue and create dependence to the platform Feeling of Threatened by competitors Tends to adhere to platforms if s ee competitors joining. Join food delivery platform could not be the best strategy for the business Promote the restaurant in other channels Reach new clients which could increase the volume of sales Give up of information regarding customers which it is important to sustain growth. Create more dependence to the food delivery platform Reach other areas which local store does not attend Expand the business. Because lack of sharing information with the platform, does not know where the best places are to e xpand", "Moreover, other drivers were found regarding some specificities to each business in the sample which complements our analysis and were discussed in the previous chapter. In order to summarize the findings, the table below present those drivers and the conclusions about it : Table 6: Summary of Drivers found in the field research Theory Construct Drivers found in the research Quote Information Processing Theory Information capacity Grow customer base and access information “ One disadvantage to the use of food delivery platforms is because we don´t know anything about the client we are serving.

Both theories together were used as a tool to analyze the impacts of information in the process of build or enhance internal capabilities when restaurants use food delivery platforms as a tool in their operations . The research question was based on what factors influence them to join those platforms and how they could help them in the process of sustainable growth.", "Among many factors, we noticed, in our sample, that the environment could also influence in the owner´s decision specially if they see their competitors join pla tforms while they decide to not what could be explained by another theory - the platform theory. This could be an interesting approach for another study once this study will focus on the internal factors of restaurants that make owners decided to join food deliver platforms.

Rio de Janeiro is a considered a metropolis and the second biggest economic city in Br azil. Besides, Rio de Janeiro is a touristic place and very culture diverse.

Uma vez que a composição química dos raios cósmicos com energias acima de 1018 eV se torna mais pesada a medida que a energia aumenta e, considerando que o nosso conhecimento sobre os campos magnéticos galáctico e extragaláctico e escasso, a melhor maneira de identificar as fontes dessas partículas e através da combinação das diferentes medidas realizadas pela Colaboração Auger. Portanto, o principal objetivo deste trabalho e contribuir para a obtenção de um cenário global acerca destes raios cósmicos ultraenergéticos, combinando informações relacionadas a composição química da partícula primária, espectro de energia e direções de chegada. A principal contribuição desta tese e o desenvolvimento de um código independente para o ajuste combinado da composição química e espectro de energia dos eventos medidos pela Colaboração Pierre Auger.

Although these results strongly indicate that the cosmic rays of higher energies have an extragalactic origin, identifying of their sources has not yet been possible. Since the mass composition of cosmic rays with energies above 1018eV becomes heavier as the energy increases and, considering that our knowledge about the galactic and extragalactic magnetic \felds is scarce, the best way to identify the sources of these particles is through the combination of the di\u000berent measures performed by the Auger Collaboration. Therefore, the main goal of this work is to contribute to obtaining a global scenario about these ultra-energetic cosmic rays by combining information related to the chemical composition of the primary particle, energy spectrum, and arrival directions. The main contribution of this thesis is the development of an independent code for the combined \ft of the chemical composition and energy spectrum of the events measured by the Pierre Auger Collaboration. In addition, we added information about large-scale anisotropies reported for events with energy above 8 \u00021018eV. Although a discrepancy is observed between the model's predictions and the data on the dipole amplitude for events with energies above 32 \u00021018eV, the tool developed and made available to the Auger Collaboration is of prime importance in order to establish a global image of the Universe at high energies.", "Additionally, motivated by the recent result reported by the Auger Collaboration, in which it is shown that it is possible to obtain information on the chemical composition PhD thesis xiii of the cosmic rays on an event-by-event basis by using neural networks and data from the surface detector, we estimated the gain in the detection power of the cross-correlation estimator between the directions of the events and the positions of possible sources, when using samples containing lighter nuclei. We also calculated probability maps related to the chemical composition of events in the celestial sphere and showed that the shu\u000fing tech- nique can be used for the events measured by the Fluorescence Detector of the observatory. With the knowledge obtained during the construction of the chemical composition maps, we exempli\fed the gain in the detection power when we combine directional intens- ity data and directional composition data in comparison with the analysis of directional composition data only.", "Finally, assuming that the cosmic rays with energies above 39 \u00021018eV, signi\fcantly correlated with the position of starbursts galaxies, are nuclei of charge Zand energy E, we searched for an excess of events in the same directions at energies above E=Z, due to protons originated from the same sources.", "We hope that the analyzes described in this work will contribute to a better under- standing of ultra-energetic cosmic rays and their role in the Universe. xiv PhD thesis List of Figures 2.4 The Hillas plot classifying potential sources of UHECRs according to their 3.1 Schematic view showing the positions of the detectors at the site of the 3.8 Combined energy spectrum, adjusted to a theoretical PhD thesis xv LIST OF FIGURES 3.13 Scan of test statistic (TS) as a function of the energy threshold for SBGs and -AGNs with and without take into account the attenuation of the intensity", "3.15 DeviancepD\u0000Dmin, as function of", "4.1 Distributions of the number of pairs obtained from one speci\fc simulation of an isotropic cosmic-ray sky containing 1,000 events. . . . . . . . . . . . . 43 4.2 Example of Landy-Szalay cross-correlation estimator between a simulated isotropic dataset and positions of starburst galaxies. . . . . . . . . . . . . . 44 4.3\u001f2distributions obtained for a scenario with a fraction of proton fp= 5% and di\u000berent fractions of selected events fsel 5.1 Mean Xmaxmap for events with energy above 1018:7eV using a top-hat angular window of 20 °.

Therefore, the main goal of this thesis is to contribute to obtaining a comprehensive scenario about the UHECRs by combining information related to the mass compositions, energy and arrival directions of those particles.", "The thesis is structured as follows. In chapter 2, an overview of the UHECR \feld is presented, discussing possible source candidates for the acceleration of these particles as PhD thesis 1 CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION well as energy loss processes and de ections by magnetic \felds during their propagation from sources to Earth. In chapter 3, we describe the Pierre Auger Observatory, its detection techniques and the most important results. Subsequently, the studies conducted in this work are presented in the following chapters.", "Part of the di\u000eculty in identifying the sources of UHECRs comes from the fact that the information on the chemical composition of primary cosmic ray is obtained statistically from the distribution of the atmospheric depth in which the energy deposition by the atmospheric shower is maximum, Xmax. At the Pierre Auger Observatory, this information is obtained by the uorescence telescopes, which operate only on clear nights, without moonlight, corresponding to \u001813% of the operating time of the experiment. We recently showed in [1] that it is possible to obtain the same information in an event-by-event basis by using deep neural networks and the surface detectors of the experiment (which operate 100% of the time). This possibility opens up a very interesting window for anisotropy studies. In this way, we exemplify, in chapter 4, the gain in detection e\u000eciency of standard cross-correlation analyses, such as the Landy-Szalay estimator [2], when we select a sample containing only events with the highest Xmaxvalues (corresponding to the lightest charged particles, whose de ections in magnetic \felds are smaller on average).", "In chapter 5, as an important cross-check of the composition anisotropy reported in [3], we build mass composition maps and compute the statistical signi\fcance of larger or smallerhXmaxithrough the celestial sphere in a completely independent way. Besides, a useful strategy to compute the statistical signi\fcance of these composition maps is to perform the shu\u000fing technique, which implicitly assumes that the zenith angle distribution of detected events is time-independent. Since there are di\u000berent sources of background light during the period of the Fluorescence Detector data, this assumption can be no longer valid. Therefore, we also investigate in this chapter the applicability of the shu\u000fing technique to events detected by the Fluorescence Detector studying the behavior of the mean zenith angle distribution as a function of the ADC count signal variance. After studying directional intensity data in chapter 4 and directional composition data in chapter 5, we exemplify, in chapter 6, the net gain obtained by combining both", "2 PhD thesis", "CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION information in comparison to the standalone analysis of directional composition data only (as done in chapter 5). For this, we used a cross-correlation estimator in order to characterize whether possible similarities between these data are signi\fcant or not. Sensitivity curves as a function of the composition modulation are obtained. In chapter 7, motivated by the indication of anisotropy in the arrival directions of events with energies above 39 EeV [4] through comparison to the ux pattern of ex- tragalactic gamma-ray sources, we search for excesses of events at lower energies around the directions of the starburst galaxies by considering the proposition of Waxman and Lemoine [5]. According to it, assuming that the cosmic ray acceleration depends just on the particle rigidities and neglecting the energy losses during the cosmic-ray propagation, an anisotropy at highest energy due to nuclei of charge Zand energy Eshould be followed by an anisotropy in the same direction of the sky at energies Ztimes smaller ( E=Z) due to protons originated in the same sources. No signi\fcant excess of events was found in any of the energy bins considered.", "The main contribution of this thesis is presented in chapter 8, in which we perform a combined \ft of the energy spectrum, mass composition, and arrival direction measurements obtained by the Pierre Auger Observatory.

A summary of the conclusions as well as a short outlook on the future improvements of the analyses performed in this thesis are described in chapter 9.", "PhD thesis 3 Chapter 2 Overview of Ultra-High Energy Cosmic Rays The discovery of cosmic rays was undoubtedly a breakthrough in Science. By 1912, in an experiment on board of a balloon, Victor Hess observed that the ionization rate of the Earth's atmosphere at a height of 5300 meters was about three times higher than at sea level. This \fnding led Hess to conclude that the excess rate of ionization at higher altitudes is due to the radiation coming from outer space. Hess received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1936 for this discovery. Between the 30s and 50s of the 20th century, it is interesting to know that before the construction of particle accelerators, the main source of the discovery of new particles was through cosmic rays. In 1932, the positron ( e+) was discovered by Carl Anderson when he studied cosmic-ray trajectories in a Wilson chamber with a Pb plate inside [6]. Later, in 1937, Carl Anderson and Seth Neddermeyer discovered the muon by analyzing cosmic-ray traces by inserting a Geiger counter into a Wilson chamber [7]. The discovery of pion was made in 1947 by Cesar Lattes, G. Occhialini and C. Powell via exposing emulsion plates to cosmic radiation at higher altitudes on Mount Chacaltaya in Bolivia [8]. In 1938, Pierre Auger used two ionizing radiation detectors spatially separated and detected the simultaneous arrival of a high ux of particles that provided a \frst means to estimate the energy of cosmic rays. In this experiment, Auger discovered the cascades of", "4 PhD thesis", "CHAPTER 2.

In this pioneering experiment, Pierre Auger was capable of measuring energies to an upper limit of 1015eV. The experiment occupied an area of 8 km2, with 19 scintillators positioned at a distance of\u00181 km between them [9].", "Later in 1962, John Linsley developed the arrays of large detectors which were used for the \frst detection of an ultra-high energy cosmic ray of 100 EeV (1020eV) at the Volcano Ranch experiment in New Mexico [10]. Since that time, several experiments have been dedicated to the detection of high energy cosmic rays. Even today, the only way to study particles at energies higher than 1017eV is in UHECR experiments. Its study allows us to establish characteristic properties of propagation in the intergalactic medium, identify the sources capable of providing this energy, and delve into theoretical models about the processes linked to acceleration mechanisms, provide information on high-energy hadronic interactions and elucidate the nature of the primary particles. After more than 100 years, it still remains one of the most fascinating mysteries in astrophysics. This chapter is dedicated to show the technical details of our current understanding of cosmic-ray phenomenon.", "2.1 Cosmic-ray spectrum", "The term cosmic rays these days is used to describe essentially high-energy charged particles1that travel through the Universe at very nearly the speed of light. They play an important role in astrophysics on several scales, with cosmic-ray energies computable on Earth ranging from 106eV up to 1020eV (from about 1 particle/m2/s at low energies, to 1 particle/km2/century at the highest energies). It is remarkable that the highest energies observed are several orders of magnitude higher than the energies currently accessible in human-made particle accelerators. In Fig. 2.1, the energy spectrum, i.e. the ux rate at Earth as a function of energy is shown, which is a powerful tool to understand cosmic rays 1Actually, neutral particle such as photons, neutrinos and neutrons are also cosmic rays. In this thesis, however, we will use the term \\cosmic rays\" only to refer to charged particles. PhD thesis 5 CHAPTER 2. OVERVIEW OF ULTRA-HIGH ENERGY COSMIC RAYS (sources, acceleration mechanism) through the di\u000berent features. Generally the ux can be described by a power law, and can be roughly expressed as:", "J(E) =dN dEdAd dt/E\u0000 In this expression, is the spectral index and dNis the number of particles arriving at Earth per energy dE, surfacedA, timedtand solid angle d", ". At the lowest energies,", "the ux of cosmic rays is high enough to be directly observed at high altitudes or in space, allowing for precise composition measurements. In these regions the spectrum is well described by a power law of spectral index of \u00182:7. At higher energies, cosmic rays have to be detected indirectly, through ground detectors, studying cascades of secondary particles generated in the atmosphere. We are now mainly interested in higher energies, E\u00151018eV. From these energies on, the ux becomes too low that even the ground detectors \fnd it di\u000ecult to accumulate su\u000ecient statistics to measure the spectrum. The changes in the spectral index in di\u000berent energy regions of the spectrum are thought to be due to changes in composition, propagation or sources. Fig 2.1 shows some features in the spectrum, which are interpreted in terms of astrophysical phenomena [12]. The energy spectrum exhibits three main features described below:", "Knee At around E\u00184\u00021015eV, the spectrum \frst steepens, and shows a change in the spectral slope from \u00182.6 to\u00183:1. This is assumed to be the maximum acceleration energy galactic sources can reach for protons [13]. After that, a second knee is seen around \u00181017eV, and the power law becomes steeper. Composition studies have suggested a transition from a lighter to a heavier nucleus. Therefore, the second knee could indicate the maximum energy of the ux of the heavy galactic component [14, 15].", "6 PhD thesis", "CHAPTER 2.

The ankle can be interpreted as the transition from Galactic to PhD thesis 7 CHAPTER 2. OVERVIEW OF ULTRA-HIGH ENERGY COSMIC RAYS extragalactic origin of the cosmic rays [16]. However, it has also been proposed that the ankle emerges due to the onset of e+e\u0000pair production of extra-galactic protons with the cosmic microwave background, in the so-called dip model [17], or by photo-disintegration of heavy nuclei near their sources [18].", "Suppression Finally, an interesting region is the end of the spectrum, at energies above E\u0018 4\u00021019eV, where a suppression in the ux of cosmic rays has been observed by the Pierre Auger Observatory (more details in section 3.3). This suppression has two possible explan- ations: the theoretically predicted GZK cuto\u000b2(a prediction of a ux suppression due to resonant pion-photoproduction of UHECRs nuclei with photonbackgrounds, described in more details in section 2.3) or as due to the extragalactic sources reaching a limit to their acceleration capabilities (maximum rigidity). The phenomenological reason for this suppression is still on debate and unclear. To distinguish the two scenarios it is necessary to study the mass composition of elements that arrive at Earth.", "2.2 Acceleration Mechanisms", "When studying ultra-high energy cosmic rays, the big question involved is about the acceleration mechanisms that are able to boost the particle to such a high energy. Cosmic rays of low energies ( E < 1017eV) can be accelerated by what we call the \\Fermi mechanism\", proposed by Enrico Fermi in 1949 [19]. The astrophysical processes respons- ible for the acceleration of the particles that make up the UHECRs ( E > 1018eV) are still unknown, and what exists today are theoretical models that seek to describe them. Historically, there are two classes of acceleration processes that we can consider: the \frst one is called bottom-up model, which is currently the most accepted model, and the second one is the top down model, which was discarded according to data obtained by the Pierre Auger Collaboration.", "2GZK - referred to the famous Greisen, Zatsepin and Kuzmin cuto\u000b.", "8 PhD thesis", "CHAPTER 2. OVERVIEW OF ULTRA-HIGH ENERGY COSMIC RAYS The top-down model was proposed to explain the energy spectrum measured by the AGASA experiment, which was not compatible with the ux suppression for energies higher than 1019:5eV [20]. The absence of the GZK suppression could be explained by a continuous distribution of sources originating particles of very high energy close to the Earth. This suggests that the particles for these models would originate from remnants of the early Universe with energies greater than 1021eV [21]. In this scenario, UHECRs are the decay product of more energetic exotic particles, such as topological defects from the early Universe, then generating a cosmic ray which traveled to Earth. One of the main constraints in such theories is the explanation as to how these particles, which were created in the early Universe, would still be abundant today. The reason that discarded this model is that, in theory, there would be a high ux of photons and neutrinos, not observed by the Auger Observatory [22, 23]. Thus, with the results described by the Pierre Auger Observatory, the Top-Down models lost relevance as candidates for sources. The bottom-up models, on the other hand, propose that UHECRs are the result of standard particles or nuclei, such as protons, being incrementally accelerated up to the highest energies. Most of them are stochastic models. In 1949, Enrico Fermi introduced the idea and proposed that charged particles gradually gain energy through multiple in- teractions on massive clouds with magnetic \felds [19]. These clouds move randomly and depending on the direction the particle enters the cloud, it can lose or gain energy. The probability of a head-on collision give as more frequent result an energy gain. Therefore, it is possible to \fnd that the average energy gain is <\u0001E >=E/\f2= (v=c)2. This mech- anism is called the second-order Fermi acceleration. Shock fronts are assumed to occur in several astrophysical environments, such as supernova remnants, jets of active galactic nuclei, gamma ray bursts in starburst galaxies, or in accretion shocks around massive galaxy cluster. As it is a second-order process, this energy gain model does not have a good e\u000eciency to reach very high energies and could not describe the density of cosmic rays considering realistic acceleration times.", "To describe another acceleration process, the model was modi\fed in 1950, being also known as di\u000busive shock acceleration [24], in which charged particles are accelerated PhD thesis 9 CHAPTER 2. OVERVIEW OF ULTRA-HIGH ENERGY COSMIC RAYS through multiple crossings of astrophysical shocks, gaining some energy at every crossing. It can be shown that at every crossing the particle gains <\u0001E >=E/\f= (v=c), named \frst-order Fermi mechanism. The spectrum expected in the \frst-order Fermi mechanism, in the test particle limit, for non-relativistic shock acceleration, is a power law with a \fxed index \u00182 and \u00182:2 to 2:3 for relativistic shock acceleration [25]. For this, an acceleration site needs to preserve the particles inside the magnetic \feld region.", "2.3 Propagation of Ultra-High Energy Cosmic Rays", "After the primary particle leaves the acceleration sites, it propagates through the Universe, and may possibly reach Earth. Along this path, the primary su\u000bers interactions with matter from the intergalactic medium (IGM) or interstellar medium (ISM) or radiation \felds, such as the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and are de ected in magnetic \felds according to their charge. Therefore, when we study the propagation of UHECRs, we need to consider their energy losses by several processes.", "2.3.1 Radiation \feld interactions", "Even the largest voids of our Universe are \flled with photons of di\u000berent wavelength, which can interact with cosmic rays. At the highest energies, the dominant radiation \feld is the CMB. Outside our Galaxy, space is also \flled with photons emitted by stars, called the extragalactic background light (EBL). This radiation \feld consists mostly of the light emitted by star formation processes and AGNs which is still travelling through the Universe at wavelengths longer than it was emitted, due to redshift energy losses, absortion by dust. The EBL includes the ultraviolet (UV), optical and infrared bands (IR) of the electromagnetic spectrum. The number density of this radiation is much smaller than the CMB but still plays a roll for cosmic rays since it limits the propagation of UHECRs. While cosmic rays travel through the Universe, they interact with the cosmic microwave background and with the infrared photon backgrounds.", "10 PhD thesis", "CHAPTER 2. OVERVIEW OF ULTRA-HIGH ENERGY COSMIC RAYS Cosmic microwave background radiation is a type of electromagnetic radiation that \flls the Universe, being an important source of information about the early Universe. In the early stages of the Universe, radiation and hot plasma were dominant, \flling the cosmos with a uniform mist that became opaque at high redshifts. Successively, the Universe became colder by expansion, and when it cooled down enough, stable atoms began to form. These atoms were no longer able to absorb thermal photons, and consequently, the Universe became transparent. The CMB photons produced at this stage propagated throughout the Universe with their energy decreasing with the expansion. As well, infrared photon background is extragalactic in origin and isotropic on large scales. This is because the infrared photon background is described by a spectrum formed from the evolution and luminosity from sources, along with dust and cosmological formation processes of stars and galaxies [26]. As the formation of cosmic infrared radiation is directly linked to the formation of stars in the Universe, limits of this radiation can be used to provide links in the history of the formation and evolution of galaxies. The interaction of cosmic rays with the CMB is named after Greissen, Zatsepin and Kuzmin (GZK) [27, 28], and involves the excitation of a ultra-high energy proton at the Delta resonance that quickly decays to a proton and a neutral pion, or a neutron and a positive pion as:", "p+ p+ where CMB is a photon from the CMB and \u0001+is the unstable delta baryon.

OVERVIEW OF ULTRA-HIGH ENERGY COSMIC RAYS For protons with energy increasing above 1019:7eV, the attenuation length3quickly shortens from 110 Mpc due to the onset of photo-pion production with the CMB. The result of this process is that there should be a cut-o\u000b of the cosmic-ray spectrum at an energy of about 1019:7eV. This predicted end to the cosmic-ray spectrum is called the GZK-limit. It also has profound consequences for the origin of the cosmic rays, and it would not be possible to observe protons with energies above the GZK limit coming from distant sources.

OVERVIEW OF ULTRA-HIGH ENERGY COSMIC RAYS of particles leaving the source (primary particles) can be modi\fed on the way to Earth (secondary particles). Currently, we have a consensus that index changes of the power-law spectrum are due to changes in the chemical composition and sources of cosmic rays. For energies below 1014eV, the elemental abundance in the ux of cosmic rays can be measured directly using detectors above the atmosphere. This is not possible at higher energies due to the steep decrease of the ux with growing energy. Therefore, it is extremely import- ant to study their energy spectrum according to the composition of the observed ux to provide theoretical models that explain how UHECRs are generated. Moreover, observ- ables sensitive to energy and composition of the primary cosmic rays must be carefully analyzed.", "The composition of UHECRs is determined from the nature of the particle that collided at the top of the atmosphere and its shower.

As it di\u000bers for di\u000berent primary species, it is indicated to discriminate particles by their primary mass. However, uctuations in the early state of the air-shower development prevent an event-by- event discrimination.

Therefore, showers produced by iron primaries reach their maximum development ( Xmax) higher in the atmosphere. Additionally, for the same reason, uctuations in the \frst interaction depth are signi\fcantly smaller for iron primaries than for protons. Therefore, the Xmaxdistribution becomes narrower for iron primaries by a factor of three with respect to that of protons [41].

The shower particles excite and polarize the medium and the molecules will lose energy by re-emitting radiation. The particle speed exceeds the speed of light in the water, and the Cherenkov e\u000bect occurs, producing light. The Cherenkov light is collected by three photomultipliers (PMTs) which are symmetrically distributed at a distance of 1.20 m from the center of the tank, and they look downwards through windows of clear polyethylene into the water. These PMTs then emit analog signals at the last dynode and at the anode, which are read by a front-end card, placed in a box above the tanks, and converted into digital signals by FADC (Fast Analog Digital Converter), with a sampling frequency of 40 MHz, i.e., one sample every 25 ns. The digitized signals are sent to the station trigger block. The detector trigger time, crucial for event reconstruction, is measured with a precision of \u00188 ns using the Global Positioning System (GPS) units. The output signals which pass a certain trigger level are transmitted to the closest FD location by a radio antenna \fxed on the detector surface, from where they are transferred via communication towers to the Central Data Acquisition System (CDAS) building in Malarg ue for further processing (higher trigger levels). The SD has a duty cycle of about 100%, so that it provides the vast majority of the events. However, unlike the uorescence detector, it cannot directly observe an air shower devel- opment. The goal of the SD is to measure the lateral distribution function (LDF1) of the shower which is useful to reconstruct the primary particle energy [43]. 1LDF is a function that describes the number of particles as a function of the distance to the shower core, de\fned as the point where the shower axis meets the ground.

The entire sample is generated by taking into account the exposure of the Pierre Auger Observatory, and the depth of shower maximum Xmaxfor each particle is generated according to the Gumbel parameterizations, considering the EPOS-LHC model [49].

Splitting the FD data into on and o\u000b-plane regions using the Galactic latitude of each event to form two distributions in Xmax, it was found that the distribution of Xmaxfrom the on-plane region has a 9 :1\u00061:6+2:1 \u00002:2g/cm2shallower mean and a 5 :9\u00062:1+3:5 narrower width than that of the o\u000b-plane region, considering an energy threshold of 1018:7 eV and a galactic latitude splitting at jbj= 30\u000e[3].", "The analysis described in this chapter was performed as a cross-check of these results, by computing the statistical signi\fcance of larger or smaller hXmaxithrough the celestial sphere in a completely independent way.

As the variance of the ADC3counts is proportional to the background light, we \frst study the behavior of the mean zenith angle distribution as a function of the signal variance. Finally, the zenith angle distribution is analyzed as a function of the detection time. Since the variance of the ADC counts is proportional to the background light, the idea is to use events that pass the quality selection cuts [59] to study the behavior of the mean zenith angle as a function of the variance.

We conclude that both have similar detection power. A probable reason for that is the small value of the zcomponent of the dipole dzconsidered in our toy model (\u000ed=\u000024\u000e). As a consequence, the gain in using 3D data is not satisfactory. A larger detection power is expected in the case of a dipolar ux modulation with a larger dz component. This should be considered in the future since the aim of this study is to search for correlation between directional ux and directional mass composition data in several energy bins.", "66 PhD thesis", "CHAPTER 6.

PhD thesis 67 Chapter 7 Correlation Studies of UHECRs events and starburst sources at lower energies Recently the Pierre Auger Collaboration reported an indication of anisotropy in the arrival directions of cosmic rays with energy above 39 EeV on an intermediate angular scale. As described in chapter 3.3.3, this results is based on the search for a correlation between Auger data and two classes of sources detected by Fermi-LAT - active galactic nuclei (AGN) and starburst galaxies, by using their gamma-ray and radio ux as weights for their relative cosmic-ray luminosity. The UHECR model was built as a sum of an isotropic and an anisotropic component, the last one originated from the selected sources. A maximum likelihood analysis, with anisotropic fraction fand search radius as free parameters, was performed to optimize the degree of correlation between the sky map and the cosmic-ray events. For the gamma-ray AGNs, a 2 :7\u001bexcess was found at an angular \u00002:3\u000eand for star forming galaxies the best-\ft search reached a maximum at 4:0\u001bat an angular scale of = 13\u000e+4:0\u000e Inspired in a previous correlation between events with energy above 55 EeV and AGNs from the VCV catalog [5], searches for overdensities at lower energies were performed [61]", "68 PhD thesis", "CHAPTER 7.

According to it, assuming that the cosmic-ray acceleration depends just on the particle rigidities and neglecting the energy losses during the cosmic-ray propagation, an anisotropy at high energy due to nuclei of charge Zand energy Eshould be followed by an anisotropy in the same direction of the sky at energies Ztimes smaller ( E=Z) due to protons originated in the same sources. Taking into account the energy bins relative to Z= 2, 6, 13 and 26, no evidence for overdensities was found.", "In this work, assuming that the correlation of the arrival directions of events with energy above 39 EeV and the starburst galaxies reported in [4] is originated by nuclei of chargeZ= 2, 6, 13 or 26, we search for overdensities within 21\u000earound the starburst directions at corresponding energy thresholds of Eth=Z= 19.5 EeV, 6.5 EeV, 3.0 EeV and 1.5 EeV.

Systematic uncertainties on Xmax The systematic uncertainties of instrumental origin a\u000bect both the measurements of the energy and the Xmax. The uncertainty on the energy scale is assumed to be \u0001 E=E = 14% [55], while the one in Xmaxranges from 6 to 9 g/cm2[59].

This is a very important investigation and remains to be done in a near future. In this work, we only model uncertainties on the reconstructed Xmaxarising either from the systematic uncertainties on the measured value or from variations due to the hadronic model considered by shifting the Gumbel model by a quantity \u000e.

So, considering a gate function for the description of the systematic uncertainty, this result is not satisfactory. Furthermore, the dipole amplitude measurements by Auger are equally not well described by the models, as one can notice from the high values of Ddip.", "E\u000bect of the choice of hadronic interaction model We also studied the impact on the \ft results of changing the hadronic interaction model. For this goal, only for the case without source evolution ( m= 0), we used the Sibyll 2.3d [75] hadronic interaction model instead of EPOS-LHC. We refer to this model as CTGS. We also considered the cases of \u001b0= 10\u000eand\u001b0= 20\u000e, as well as the possible systematic shift in Xmaxdistributions. Table 8.6 summarizes the results of the best \ft for both smearing parameters. One can notice an increase in the contribution of He at sources with a worsening of the energy spectrum deviance.

Furthermore, the di\u000berences between observation and model for 5 \u0014E=EeV<8 could be explained by a possible superposition of Galactic and an extragalactic ux at this energy range, in such a way that the predicted extragalactic large-scale anisotropy would be canceled. The tension for E > 32 EeV, on the other hand, could be reduced by considering, for instance, a more realistic description of the Galactic magnetic \feld, a larger abundance of silicon and iron at sources or the emergence of a dominant source at these energies.", "Possible extensions of this analysis include a realistic descriptions of the Galactic magnetic \feld, source overdensity as in [66], source emissivity proportional to its elec- tromagnetic counterpart, larger statistics for Xmaxmeasurements at the highest energies (possibly by using information collected by the SD) and addition of anisotropy measure- ments for events with energies above 40 EeV.", "Despite of this, the addition of anisotropy information to the combined \ft, as well as the availability of the analysis code for collaboration, represents a necessary and fun- damental step forward to a better comprehension of the Auger measurements, aiming to establish a global picture of our Universe at the highest energies. PhD thesis 105 Chapter 9 Conclusions Since the beginning of this PhD study, in 2017, it was already clear that, due to the increasing cosmic-ray mass composition with energies and considering that the magnetic de ection in the particle trajectory is proportional to its electrical charge, only the combination of di\u000berent measurements performed by the Pierre Auger Collaboration could make it possible the identi\fcation of the ultra-high energy cosmic-ray sources. From this perspective, all the analyses presented at this thesis aim to enhance our comprehension of UHECRs by using at the same time information about the cosmic-ray mass composition, energy and arrival direction.", "The main contribution of our study is the development of an independent code to perform the combined \ft of the energy spectrum and mass composition measured with the Pierre Auger Observatory. This code has been made available for the use and development of the entire Auger Collaboration. Additionally, we inserted in the \ft the observed large- scale anisotropy reported for events with energies above 8 EeV and study the impact on the deviance of di\u000berent source evolutions, magnetic de ections and hadronic interaction models. For this, we consider that the UHECRs sources are distributed as the local matter for distances r <285 Mpc and homogeneoulsy distributed otherwise.

CONCLUSIONS is too high, being the main reason for that the very high dipole amplitude predicted by the model for E > 32 EeV. This tension could be reduced by considering, for instance, a more realistic description of the Galactic magnetic \feld, a larger abundance of Silicon and Iron at sources or the emergence of a dominant source at these energies. Nevertheless, the inclusion of anisotropy information to the combined \ft and the availability of the analysis code for the Auger Collaboration are of prime importance to establish a complete picture over these high energy particles. Furthermore, we estimated the increase in the power detection of the Landy-Szalay cross-correlation estimator when one uses a small sub set of data containing the highest Xmaxevents. The gain depends on the proton fraction ranging from a factor of \u00182 to\u00184. Additionally, we built mass composition maps and computed the statistical signi- \fcance of larger or smaller hXmaxithrough the celestial sphere. As a by-product of this study, we have shown that the zenith angle distribution of the cosmic rays detected by the Fluorescence Detector is independent of the detection time, indicating that the shu\u000fing technique can be safely applied for those events.", "From the knowledge obtained by using compositions maps, we exempli\fed the net gain obtained by combining both the directional intensity data and directional composition data in comparison to the standalone analysis of directional composition data only. For this, we used a cross-correlation estimator in order to characterize whether possible similarities between these data are signi\fcant or not. As a result, we observed that the power detection is 99% even for modest cases in which the signi\fcance of the \frst harmonic modulation of hXmax(\u000b)irelative tohXmaxiis 1.6\u001b.", "Finally, assuming that the cosmic rays with energies above 39 EeV, correlated with starburst galaxies, are nuclei of charge Zand energy E, according to the Waxmann and Lemoine proposition, we should observe an anisotropy in the same direction of the sky at energiesZtimes smaller ( E=Z), due to protons originated in the same sources. Considering this, we searched for excess of events around the starburst directions at energy thresholds ofEth=Z= 19:5 EeV, 6.5 EeV, 3.0 EeV and 1.5 EeV, corresponding to Z= 2, 6, 13 or 26 at energies above 39 EeV. No signi\fcant excess of events was observed. PhD thesis 107 CHAPTER 9. CONCLUSIONS Recently the Pierre Auger Collaboration has shown that it is possible to obtain information about the cosmic-ray mass composition in a event-by-event basis by using deep neural networks and the surface detectors of the observatory, which operates almost 100% of the time. This opens a very interesting window for anisotropy studies expanding the importance of the results presented here.", "In summary, the work described in this thesis was reported in 5 internal notes of the Pierre Auger Collaboration [94, 95, 96, 97, 98] and discussed in several meetings of the Pierre Auger Collaboration [99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104]. The importance of code availability for the Collaboration can be observed, for instance, by noticing that the new feature in the energy spectrum is interpreted [12] in terms of a scenario that best \fts the Auger measurements. The cross-checks performed within the Pierre Auger Collaboration are equally, being the paper [66] an example of our contribution. Finally, we expect that the analyzes described in this work contribute to a better comprehension about the UHECRs and its role in the Universe at the highest energies.", "108 PhD thesis", "Bibliography [1] A.

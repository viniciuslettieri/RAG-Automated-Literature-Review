Por conta disso, é importante o desenvolvimento de novas tecnologias que permitam um aumento de eficiência na produção de óleo e um melhor aproveitamento dos recursos atuais. Durante a operação de produção de petróleo, danos na formação podem ocorrer devido a perfuração, completação ou devido à alguma prática de produção. Esse dano pode restringir a produção de óleo e resultar em petróleo sendo deixado na formação (SCHECHTER, 1993). Para resolver este problema, técnicas de estimulação de poços são usadas. As técnicas mais comuns são fraturamento por meio de explosivos, fraturamento hidráulico e injeção de ácido. Este trabalho será focado no último destes.

caused by drilling, completion or production is commonly distributed during the entire production process [6]", " Thus, to remove damage and enhance productivity, acid solution is injected into the

Acid (HCL)", " The usage of this acid has been proved to be an e\u000bective stimulation treatment in carbonate reservoirs", " However, in formations with huge heterogeneity, the acid ows into high permeabilities layers rather than into lower ones", " The consequence is a non-uniform treatment as the low permeability layer remains untreated [9]", " Therefore, an e\u000bective uid placement is a key feature to achieve a more uniform treatment", " For this purpose, mechanical or chemical diver- sion techniques can be used", " Mechanical methods mainly includes packers and/or ball plugs, ball sealers and coiled tubing, but they are time consuming, expensive or limit the pump rate [10]", " Through the years, many chemicals have been devel- oped to enhance acid diversion by increasing the viscosity of the injected acid [11]", " These more-viscous acids retard the reaction and can help reduce the leako\u000b rate from the wormhole walls, resulting in deeper penetration of the acid

have been used in the literature to model the reactive ow of diverting acids in porous media and most of the existing work for larger scales is based on a Darcy approach [6, 9, 10, 12, 17]", " However, these Darcy-based approaches cannot be reasonably expected to capture the highly nonlinear dynamics associated with the inception and evolution of dissolution \fngers", " Indeed, at the scale of the channels, the ow is governed by the Navier-Stokes equations and not the Darcy's law [18]", " Due to this fact, an approach based on the volume average of the Navier Stokes equation has been used by some authors to describe the dissolution phenomena in porous media [18, 19]", " After the averaging process, some extra terms appears in the resultant equations", " One of them is the solid- uid interaction term, which depends of the uid rheology and pore geometry", " To better represent the behavior of VES acids in porous media, this term needs to be modeled in a consistent way", "",

According to the International Energy Agency, more than 80 % of the energetic matrix is composed by non-renewable sources, with petroleum representing approximately 30 % of the total value [20]. In Brazil, the panorama is similar principally in terms of petroleum consumption, and the forecast for the next decade is that this source prevails as the main energetic source in the country [1].", "Due to this fact, the production e\u000eciency is a point of great concern in the oil industry. This concern starts at the drilling stage, where formation damage occurs (most of the times unavoidably) and reduces well productivity. In order to minimize this problem, di\u000berent stimulation techniques can be used as perforating methods, hydraulic fracturing and matrix acidizing [2]. The present work focuses on the last technique.", "Matrix stimulation is a technique that has been used since the 1930s to improve production from oil and gas wells and to improve injection into injection wells. Its principle consists of injecting a uid to dissolve and/or disperse materials that impair well production or to create channels with high conductivity between the well bore and the formation [21].", "Hydrochloric acid (HCl) is the most commonly acid used in matrix acidizing, principally of carbonates (very present in Brazilian pre-salt). The reason for its usage is its relatively low cost, strong dissolution reactions with calcite and dolomite and the reactant products are soluble in water, do not causing any harm to the stimulation operation [22, 23]. However, due to HCl high acid-rock reaction rate with carbonate, the high conductivity channels formed during the formation dissolution quickly become the main ow path for the injected acid. This phenomena causes a non-uniform treatment of the reservoir layers, which is a non desirable outcome To enhance the treatment e\u000eciency, divergent agents are commonly used in matrix acidizing operations. There are many techniques that can be used, with its own pros and cons [9, 25, 26]. Some of these techniques are presented in the following sections.", "2.1.1 Alternate stages of acid and viscous uids This technique, as its name suggests, consists in alternate the acid with a high viscos- ity uid. At \frst, acid is pumped and ows through the high permeability zones. By that, the zones with lower permeability remains untreated as the acid keeps owing through the high conductivity zones. As the viscous uid is injected and penetrate the already treated zones, the resistance to the ow in these regions is enhanced, forcing the ow through the lower permeability zones. The main drawback of this technique is in treatment of thick intervals. During bullhead treatment, there is no control over which zones are being treated \frst, or last with a viscous uid diverter.", "As a consequence, large treatment volumes may be required. If several treatment stages are needed, the treatment cost becomes relatively expensive [24].", "2.1.2 In-situ crosslinked acid (ICA)", "In-situ crosslinked acids (ICAs), also referred to as self-diverting agents (SDA) are designed to overcome the problem with the treatment of thick intervals. In the literature, di\u000berent formulations of these uids were tested in di\u000berent conditions in order to promote acid divergence. VERNAEZ et al. [27] proposed an oil-based self- degradable gel as a divergent agent. The diversion results were considered good, but polymer residual may promote residual damage. That conclusion is in agreement with the observations made by NASR-EL-DIN et al. [28], who shown that this type of acids can cause formation damage in tight zones and precipitate depends on its composition and system conditions. ABOU-SAYED et al. [22] used an ICA system based on a HCl solution, a gelling agent and a pH sensitive crosslinker. The crosslinker becomes active in a pH range between 2 and 3, with viscosity values between 200 and 500 kg=(ms) in this range. When pH reaches values above 3.5, the crosslinker agent becomes inactive and the viscosity becomes lower again. It was observed that the ICA agent promoted diversion e\u000eciently in dual-core ow tests in core plugs of similar rock types and permeability ratios lower than 10:1 and lower than 20:1 when diverting from dolostone to limestone. Despite the capability to promote viscosity enhancement, the main problem of this acid type is that it may promote formation damage.", "2.1.3 Viscoelastic surfactant-based self-diverting agents (VES) Viscoelastic surfactant-based acids have been used in the literature to overcome some problems caused by crosslinked acids. For example, as they do not require any metallic crosslinker such as iron, they do not react with well components (for example in sour-gas wells in which hydrogen sul\fde is produced), avoiding the formation of insoluble compounds and hence formation damage. Also, as the breaking of the surfactant gel is pH independent, there is no concern about premature breaking of the gel [29]. They also left no residual on the wormhole surfaces and requires very low cleanup process, being a good option to the treatment of long intervals without damaging the formation [30].", "The principle behind the viscosity increase in VES acids is the formation of rod- shaped micelles as the acid reacts with the formation. However, the micelles do not promote formation damage as they are transformed in spherical micelles with very low viscosity when they are in contact with hidrocarbons [6, 29, 30]. This kind of acid was used in the experiments in which the present work is based. 2.1.4 Numerical simulation of matrix acidizing process Although the wormhole formation during reactive dissolution is a topic that has been studied in the last forty years, it has a signi\fcant turning point with the two- scale continuum model proposed by PANGA et al. [31]. This kind of simulation become possible due to the evolution of computational power in this century. The original two-scale model uses Darcy law as momentum equation, a hypothesis that is not always a good assumption principally in high heterogeneous formations and with high permeabilities, a characteristic of Brazilian Pr\u0013 e-Sal carbonates. Despite of that, other authors used the same hypothesis in their work, also considering HCl as the stimulation uid [32, 33]. RATNAKAR et al. [34] used the two-scale model, also using Darcy's law as momentum equation, to model the ow of ICAs. The authors proposed an empirical equation for viscosity correction to consider the pH and temperature e\u000bect. In order to improve the model robustness, SOULAINE and TCHELEPI [18] proposed a model where the momentum equation is derived from a spacial average of the Navier Stokes equation, which makes the model more general because its capability to accurately predict ows in scenarios where the inertial terms are not despicable. The present work is based on this formulation, and the mathematical model is presented in the following sections.", "2.2 Mathematical model", "A two-scale continuum model was developed by PANGA et al. [31]. This model became widespread in literature and was latter used by MAHESHWARI et al. [32], GHOMMEM et al. [33], KALIA and BALAKOTAIAH [35, 36] to analyze reactive dissolution of carbonate rocks. It is based on the following assumptions:", "1. Darcy's", "ow;", "2. Newtonian", "uid; 3. Plane channel or cylindrical pore geometry.", "4. Linear acid reaction;", "Hypothesis 1 leads to a simpli\fed momentum equation assuming that inertial terms and viscosity di\u000busion in the uid are negligible. However, as wormholes are high conductive channels, the velocity in these regions is expected to be high and these assumptions may be non{physical. Here, the momentum equation is based on a local average approach [18, 19]. Items 2 and 3 impact directly the momentum equation source term as it is related to the solid- uid interaction. Item 4 impacts the equilibrium between mass transport and reaction rate. Considering incompressible uid, the continuity equation can be written as where\u001eis the rock porosity, tis time, uis the uid intrinsic velocity and _ mis the rate of uid/solid mass transfer per mass unit. This means that when solid minerals are transferred into the uid phase in a process like dissolution, _ mis positive. On the other hand, like in a precipitation or a deposition process, _ mis negative. When there is no phase change _ mis null. The volume averaging of the momentum equation [37] leads to where\u001astands for the uid density, pis the pressure, \u001cis the partial stress tensor anddis the interaction force per unit volume acting on the uid constituent due to its interaction with the solid phase. In other words, this term accounts for the frictional resistance at the solid boundaries of the pores. It is essentially a drag force [38]. This therm can be analytically obtained for Power-law and Newtonian uids when the pore geometry is de\fned as a plane channel or as a tube and the ow inside the pore is assumed fully{developed [38]. However, many uids that are commonly used in matrix acidizing operations have neither a Newtonian nor a power-law behavior. In this case, the uid-solid interaction term may not be analytically obtained. This issue is discussed in more detail in the rheology section. The acid specie transport equation in the Darcy scale is given by In Eq. (2.3), Cais the acid concentration in the bulk, Dis the e\u000bective dispersion tensor,avis the interfacial area available for reaction per unit volume of the medium andSis the mass sink term due to heterogeneous reaction. In this work, we consider another transport equation for the product of the reaction between the acid and the porous matrix, given by whereCatstands for the product concentration. In the initial state, Catis zero because there is no reaction. As the reaction evolves, product is formed and is taken into account by the source term S. The modeling of Sconsiders the hypothesis of equilibrium between mass transport and reaction rate at the pores surface [31]. The balance between the amount of reactant transferred to the pore surface and the amount reacted is given by kc(Ca\u0000Cs) =ksC\u0010 wherekcis the mass transfer coe\u000ecient, Csis the acid concentration at solid- uid interface,ksis the surface reaction rate constant and \u0010is the reaction order.

From this solution, six di\u000berent samples were prepared in order to obtain acid solutions with di\u000berent neutralization degrees; 3. the neutralization of the solutions was done by using CaCO 3. The calcium carbonate was added to the acid solution samples in order to obtain the de- sirable neutralization degree. For example, for a 10% neutralization degree, it was added a mass of CaCO 3to consume 10% of the initial mass of HCl; 4. then, apparent viscosity values of each solution were taken for di\u000berent shear rates.", "Table (3.1) shows the indexes used for each sample with di\u000berent neutralization degrees.", "Table 3.1: Indexes for each acid neutralization degree.

However, there is no information in this range of shear rates due to experimental limitations and this term was neglected, leading to the form of Eq. (3.1). In order to determine the Carreau model parameters that best \fts the experimen- tal results, libreO\u000ece's DEPS Evolutionary Algorithm [41] was used to minimize the quadratic error between the experimental data and the adjusted parameters.

However, this set of equations can not be solved analytically in most of practical applications. Due to this fact, numerical methods might be used in the discretization of these equations. The discretization turns the partial di\u000berential equations into algebraic equations, that can be solved on a computer [45]. For this reason, CFD simulations became feasible only in the end of the twentieth century due to the improvement of numerical methods (for example the development of the SIMPLE algorithm for pressure velocity coupling in the decade of 1970) and the improvement in hardware and processing capacity [46, 47].

Nodal points will be placed over each volume and it will storage the variable problem local values. The result of this process is a mesh on which the conservation equations will eventually be solved [5, 46]. The computational mesh must respect the following requisites: the cells/elements of the computational grid must not overlap another cell/element; the cells/elements must completely \fll the computational domain. To full\fll this two requisites, a wide variety of techniques can be used resulting in di\u000berent mesh types. Commomnly, they are classi\fed in three di\u000berent categories: structured, unstructed and hybrid. A mesh is classi\fed as structured when each volume has the same number of neighbours (except the boundary volumes). This kind of discretization has many advantages such as the simpli\fed volume indexation, but generally they are restricted to domains with simplier geometries. In unstructred meshes the elements can have di\u000berent numbers of neighbors. It brings complexity to the indexation but brings also versatility to adapt itself to complex geometry domains. At least, hybrid meshes are also commomnly used in CFD problems and consists of a mixture of the two previous types [4].

Adapted from MALISKA Despite the elements quality, the number of computational cells used in domain discretization can directly a\u000bect the simulation results. As the partial di\u000berential equations will be integrated over each cell in the mesh and each one will storage variables and elements values, the values between two adjacent nodes will be de\fned by some interpolation process (this will be discussed further in the text). Due to this fact, if the re\fnement is too coarse, the simulation results can be a\u000bected. In the other hand, if the re\fnement is too \fne, the simulation cost could be very high. Therefore, in CFD analysis it is a common practice to perform the so called grid independence tests, where the goal is to \fnd a level of re\fnement where the results are no more a\u000bected by the mesh discretization.

The choice of a coarse mesh in the simulations aims to reach the main goal of this work, namely to validate the numerical model by comparison with experimental data. Due to the fact that many simulations are needed to \fnd the best pore-scale parameters to represent the acid dissolution process, the use of a mesh with few elements is essential to achieve low computational costs. The greatest disadvantage of this method is that the wormhole morphology is not well represented. However, HAO et al. [52] observed that even using a coarse mesh and not capturing the wormhole morphology with great precision (as shown in Figure 5.2), it is possible to predict acid breakthrough as long as the pore-scale parameters ( \fand in Equation 2.12) are well adjusted.", "Figure 5.2: Conclusions obtained by HAO et al.

The Euler method, as the name suggests, consists of the implicit Euler method and was applied to the temporal derivatives of all equations. The Gauss linear method used to discretise all gradient operators consists of the central di\u000berences method. In relation to the divergent operators, the upwind method was used for the advective terms of Equations 2.3 and 2.2 due to its stability and robustness.

Chapter 6 Results and Discussion In this section we present the results associated with the numerical simulations performed with the new formulation proposed here. The objective of this section is to match the pressure drop curves obtained in the simulations with the experimental ones. The qualitative wormhole morphology for each case will be presented as well. The \frst analysis conducted was the wormhole propagation. It is important to know how the acid dissolution process occurs in this case in order to analyze the dissolution pattern formed. Figure 6.1 shown the wormhole propagation in four di\u000berent times during the simulation.", "Figure 6.1: Wormholes evolution through simulation time for Sample 1. WhereNPV (number of porous volume) is a adimensional time calculated by Equation ??.", "NPV =Qt WhereQis the injection rate and \u0003 is the Sample volume. As shown in Figure 6.1, two principal wormholes were formed in this simulation. During all dissolution process, the highest shear rates were observed in wormhole tips due to the higher velocity in these regions. Figure 6.2 shows the apparent viscosity pro\fle in the domain. The wormholes shown were plotted as an isosurface representing 10 % of the maximum acid concentration observed in the core. Figure 6.2: Apparent viscosity enhance through time for Sample 1. It is possible to notice that the higher apparent viscosity values are observed mostly in wormhole basis and in the middle of them. The \frst can be justi\fed by the low velocities at the wormholes bases. The second can be justi\fed due to the fact that the reaction product has the higher viscosity in neutralization degrees between 40 % and 50 %. Then, near to wormhole tips (where the reaction is occurring, the viscosity values are not high. It is necessary that the reaction reaches higher neutralization degrees to observe the viscosity enhancement. Figure 6.3 shows the comparison of the numerical pressure drop obtained in the simulation with the experimental data.", "After that, both numerical and experimental curve present a pressure drop in- crease, probably due to the viscosity increment. However, at some point near 0.20 pore volumes, the pressure drop starts to fall in both cases. That can be explained by the permeability increase that becomes higher than the uid viscosity, diminishing porous media resistance.", "Experimental SimulationFigure 6.3: Comparison between experimental and simulated pressure drop for Sam- ple 1.", "The same procedure made in Sample 1 analysis was made here, starting with the acid dissolution pattern. Figure 6.4 shows four di\u000berent times during the simulation of this sample.", "Figure 6.4: Wormholes evolution through simulation time for Sample 2. Even the wormhole propagation being di\u000berent (as expected) from Sample 1, the highest shear rates were also observed in wormhole tips in this case. As the wormholes grow, the pore radius enhance and the lower reaction rate diminishes shear rate at the base of the micro-channels. Figure 6.5 shows the apparent viscosity pro\fle for this sample.", "NPV = 0.22 NPV = 0.25Figure 6.5: Apparent viscosity enhance through time for Sample 2. The same behavior observed in the analysis of Sample 1 is noticed here. It is possible to identify two regions where the apparent viscosity values are higher: one at the wormholes bases and the other at the middle of wormholes length. Figure 6.6 now shows the comparison between numerical and experimental data. Experimental Simulation Figure 6.6: Comparison between experimental and simulated pressure drop for Sam- ple 2.", "Again, some oscillation was observed at the beginning of the experiment, and it is assumed to be related to the uid change process. After that, the numerical results match reasonably well with experimental data, presenting a similar behavior during the dissolution process: \frst a pressure drop increase followed by a subit fall in pressure drop curve.", "At last, Sample 3 was tested in order to verify if the model was also capable to cap- ture the experimental behavior observed in the lab. Figure 6.7 shows the wormhole propagation.", "Figure 6.7: Wormholes evolution through simulation time for Sample 3. Again, the same phenomena observed in the previous cases is obtained here. Even the dissolution pattern being di\u000berent, the highest shear rates are observed in wormhole tips. Figure 6.8 presents the apparent viscosity pro\fle in the domain. Figure 6.8: Apparent viscosity enhance through time for Sample 3. The highest apparent viscosity values were observed in the wormholes bases and at the middle regions of wormholes. Due to this fact, one can assume that both velocity and reaction rate are important to the viscosity change in this cases. Figure 6.9 presents the comparison between experimental and numerical pressure drop curves.", "Experimental Simulation Figure 6.9: Comparison between experimental and simulated pressure drop for Sam- ple 3.", "A reasonable match between numerical and experimental data was observed, showing that the model developed in this work was able to describe the reactive ow of non Newtonian acids in porous media. Chapter 7 Conclusion According to the results obtained in this work, some conclusions can be made. The main objective of the study was achieved as numerical results match with reason- able accuracy the pressure drop curves obtained experimentally. The modi\fcation in the model adding an equation to map the reaction product transport and the new solid- uid interaction term was proved to be a good strategy to capture the rheology change over the domain. The linear weighting of the partial stress tensor and solid- uid interaction term by the components mass fractions appears to be a reasonable approach as well. Furthermore, the good agreement between the \ftted curves and the rheological measurements also contributes to a good representation of the exper- imental pressure drop data. However, in order to reproduce the experimental data, many simulations had to be done to determine the best pore scale parameters for each sample. Among that, the empirical factor for shear rate correction is also an uncertainty of the model. The \frst issue is harder to overcome, as the adjustable pore scale parameters are di\u000ecult to predict as they have no concrete physical mean- ing. The second challenge can eventually be overcome by understanding in a better way how the acid rheology behaves in porous media, considering either viscometric and extensional e\u000bects. This may allow a better modelling of solid- uid interaction term with fewer empirical parameters.", "This dissertation research generated a publication at the Journal of Petroleum Science and Engineering, which can be \fnd by the reference of BARBOZA et al.

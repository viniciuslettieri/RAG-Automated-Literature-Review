INTRODUCTION", "Globally, fashion retail market is worth more than 1.7 trillion dollars (Common Objective, 2019). In Brazil, the fashion industry generates around 90 billion dollars annually (Apex, 2020). The country holds a complete chain, from the fibers’ cultivation and weaving, to manufacturing and retail, and also hosts one of the 5 biggest fashion weeks in the world (Tex Brasil, 2020).", "At the same time , textil e production and apparel manufacturing have major impacts on nature such as resources consumption, greenhouse gas emissions and water pollution. Social problems encompass unsafe working conditions and modern slavery (Ellen Mc Arthur Foundation, 2017) .", "Arou nd the world, NGOs and Governments are each day demanding more information and transparency from companies in general (Fashion Revolution, 2018; Marques et al ., 2019 ; Clean Clothes Campaign, 2020 ). Studies with young consumers from generation Z shows that most of them are engaged in responsible consumption and would stop buying from companies if they f ound out that it was involved in scandals (Ponto Eletrônico, 2017).", "However, as observed by Khurana and Richetti (2016), transparency is a balance between ris ks and opportunities. Clean clothes campaign (20 20) summarized frequent arguments presented by fashion brands to justify their lack of transparency : competitive advantage in keeping confidential their purchasing strategies and their list of suppliers, and lack of information from intermediaries who do not want to disclose their manufacturing partners . To enhance supply chain transparency, implement mechanisms and maintain periodic monitoring, implies in costs and efforts, as pointed by Marshall, McCarthy, M cGrath and Harrigan (Marshall et al., 2016). Challenges might also emerge from outside the companies, such as socio -political contexts, as pointed by Silvestre, whose study found external factors that hinders the adoption of sustainable supply chain manage ment (SSCM) practices (Silvestre, 2015 )", "As Khurana and Ricchetti (2016) found, SSCM development by apparel companies was a trial-and-error process that started after 1990s. Marshall et al . (2016) also point lack of standards as difficulties for improving supply network transparency . According to Egels - Zandén, Hulthén and Wulff (2015), transparency should be based on three aspects: traceability, by disclosing names of all suppliers in each step of production; disclosing information about sustainability condi tions at the supplier and buying firm ’s own purchasing practices. Fung’s (2013) view is that that transparency is a solution for problems generated by the lack of information. The author proposes the notion of democratic transparency, which is disclosing i nformation in a way that citizens can make better choices . Democratic transparency is based in fo ur pillars: availability, proportionality, accessibility and actionability.", "This study employs signaling theory as a lens to understand how sustainability is communicated, through supply network transparency. Signaling theory is about infor mation asymmetry, according to Connelly, Certo, Ireland and Reutzel (2011). It is focused in how one part communicates positive qualities that are imperceptible to another (Connelly et al., 2011) . Following that idea, issuing a sustainability report is one of the ways through which brands can signal their legitimacy, building trust between companies and stakeholders, as pointed by Ching and Gerab (2017). Their analysis of compa nies listed in the Brazilian Stock Market showed that along five years, the number of reports produced increased, and so did the amount and quality of the information that were disclosed (Ching & Gerab, 2017) . Su, Peng, Tan and Cheun propose that CSR (Corp orate Social Responsibility) can be a signal of corporate capabilities that might create value for those companies (Su et al., 2016) . The objective of this work is to understand how fashion brands in Brazil are signaling sustainability, through supply netw ork transparency, towards their stakeholders . Considering what they are disclosing, and by which means they do it, this study addresses the following research question (RQ) : How do Brazilian fashion brands signal sustainability through supply network trans parency?", "To answer the above RQ, this research employs a qualitative analysis based on the sample of firms taking part in the Brazilian version of the Fashion Transparency Index (FTI) of years 2018 and 2019 . Public information available on the brands ’ webs ites were collected and saved for later analysis. The material was analyzed utilizing software NVivo 12, applying content analysis methods for codification. To do that, under the concepts of signaling theory aggregated by Connelly et al. (2011), the brands were considered as signalers, the content in their website were observed as signals and Brazilian stakeholders were considered as receivers. Their disclosure of practices were coded and categorized. Their practices were contrasted with transparency aspect s developed by Fung (2013) and Egels -Zandén et al . (2015). They were then categorized to allow comparison among them, and then their main characteristics were ranked according to their level of transparency , using Lamming’s (2001) classification: l ow trans parency as opaque , medium transparency as translucent and high transparency as transparent .", "This study finds heterogeneity among brands’ views on sustainability, and consequently in their practices. Buying firm’s purchasing practices is one of the most overlooked dimension s of transparency among those companies. An interesting finding is that brands are investing in producing educative content and capturing customers’ feedback, which can foster responsible consumption and ultimately affect their revenues. This dissertation is organized in the following format: First, previous literature and theories were studied with the objective of finding gaps and opportunities for gaining new insights and creating a theoretical foundation for the research. SSCM, transpar ency, and signaling theory will be approached, and previous literature on those topics will be reviewed. Following, detailed information about the choice of qualitative approach, sample and data collection are described to elucidate the research method. Ba sed on these, the analysis of the data is done, by considering public information available on the brands’ official websites during the year 2020, focused on how are they signaling sustainability. Lessons from this context will be discussed. Finally, other conclusions, implications, limitations and opportunities for future research are considered.", "2. LITERATURE REVIEW", "2.1 SUSTAINABLE SUPPLY N ETWORK S", "In the 2000 ’s, through the incorporation of CSR and sustainability topics in the supply chain management (SCM) literature , the concept of SSCM emerged . Initial studies focused on the benefits of adopting sustainable practices. Carter, Kale and Grimm (2000) developed a study to investigate the relation between environmental purchasing and firm performance, finding posit ive correlation between them. In 2008 , Carter and Rogers propose a definition and a framework of SSCM, by integrating their review on sustainability to supply chain management field (Carter & Rogers, 2008). In the same year, Seurin g and Müller , published a literature review, aiming to conceptualize SSCM. They approached the issue of external triggers to SSCM and were specific in naming it mainly as governments and customers, and not the general term “stakeholder” (Seuring & Müller, 2008) In the following ye ars, the terms stakeholder and institutional pressures become often used within the SSCM literature . This reflects the trend of bringing a broader perspective , surpassing the traditional focus in firm and supplier. Many SSCM studies relied on institutional and stakeholders theory to analyze drivers of SSCM adoption. Sancha et al. (2015) analyzed the effect of institutional pressures in adoption of supplier development practices . Dubey et al. (2017) proposes that institutional pressures, ethics and values influence firms, which might adopt sustainable practices in their supply chain, ultimately improving profitability. Mani and Gunasekaran (2018) built on stakeholder theory to identify forces driving sustainability adoption in supply chains.", "Lamming, Johnsen, Zheng and Harland (2000) analy zed studies about networks on the management field, to apply it in supply chain management , proposing a n initial classification of supply networks. Kim, Choi, Yan and Dooley (2010) observed in supply chain studies a trend in shifting to a network perspective. They developed their work using social network analysis to improve investigations in supply networks . In 2012 , Ashby, Leat and Hudson Smith reviewing sustainability and supply chain management literature found", "that these two areas were still under development, which could be noted by the multiplicity of names and definitions employed to describe it. They also p ointed the need to develop a more holistic view to the field of SSCM. Miemczyk, Johnsen and Macquet (2012) develop ed a structured literature review about sustainable purchasing, and analyzed studies on three levels: firm, dyad and supply chain/ supply network . They found that, at that time, studies on supply network level w ere minority, and that there was confusion abo ut the concept, often used as a synonym for supply chain .", "SSCM along all these years has changed and evolved, and therefore developed its own definitions of sustainability applied specifically to this field, such as green supply chain management (GSM) and sustainable supply network management (SSNM) as proposed by The strategic, transparent integration of all supply network members, including both supply chain and non -supply chain members, through the systemic coordination of knowle dge diffusion across vertical, horizontal and diagonal ties aiming at the achievement of the supply network’s social, environmental and economic goals. In this definition, the presence of the word transparent is an important aspect. SSCM studies embraced the discussion of terms such as transparency and traceability , as it will be discussed in the next section.", "Sustainable practices remained relevant inside SCM studies along these years. Qorri, Gashi and Kraslwaski (2020) reviewed SSCM studies to compare how SSCM practices influenced firm performance, sorting th ese practices into internal ones, which are under the firm’s direct control, and external ones, such as procurement or collaboration with consumers. Carter and Washispack (2018) reviewed 59 systemat ic literature reviews, and found that although there were more studies focused in the environmental pillar then in the social one, the majority of them were focused in both environmental and social, indicating that SSCM studies are becoming more aligned to a holistic view. Mark man and Krause (2014 ) believe that supply chain scholars are probably the most qualified ones to develop", "sustainability theories, due to their capacity of looking into entire value chains (or supply networks) .", "2.2 TRANSPARENCY IN SUPPLY NETW ORKS", "For Pagell and Wu, transparency and traceability concepts are discussed under an internal perspective, that is, the sharing of information inside the supply chain. Traceability would be related to materials and methods applied, and transparency, to profitability of all members across the chain (Pagell & Wu, 2009). Khurana and Richetti (201 6) consolidated lessons from two decades of SSCM in fashion industry and highlighted the fact that the sustainability focus has shifted from internal procedures to the whole process of production, including the focal companies and their supply chain – this approach stresses the need to understand transparency at a network level .", "Egels -Zandén, Hulthén and Wulff argue that some authors employ the term transparency to describe the ability to track the production process along the supply chain, while they consider this as the definition of traceability . The authors offer a framework where traceability is one of the three pillars of a transparency model proposed side by side with sustainability conditions at suppliers and buying firm purchasing practices (Egels -Zandén et Taking as a starting point the citizens’ perspective, Fung proposes that democratic transparency should be built upon four pillars . First, availability, as citizens should have access to information . Second, proportionality, as information should be provided in the same extent to which their actions cause risks . Third, accessibility, as information should be provided in a comprehensible manner . And fourth, actionability, as structures should enable citizens and organizations to take actions based on information to protect society and influence organizations (Fung, 2013). Democratic transparency as proposed is a challenge as firms often see the need for secrecy regarding their supply network information. Sometimes inform ation about supply chains can encompass strategic information that are source of competitive advantage (Khurana & Ricchetti, 2016). In cases like these,", "companies with a high degr ee of knowledge of their supply chain might deliberately opt not to disclose the referred information to protect it from competitors, what Marshall and team defined as a secret strategy (Marshall et al., 2016). This kind of concern is not limited to the buying firms. A study conducted by Egels -Zandén and colleagues showed that some suppliers did not want to share information about sub -suppliers with the buying firm, afraid that the company would bypass them and contract directly (Egels -Zandén et al., 2015). There is another problem that can occur when companies start auditing suppliers: disclosing negative information about them might undermine firm -supplier trust, which could ultimately worsen their relation, instead of improving it (Egels -Zandén et al., 20 15). In some cases, there is information available, but access and assimilation are hindered by the disclosure system itself – as pointed by Marques, Moreira, Erthal, Morais, Simões and Goes in a study about Brazilian supply network transparency. The autho rs coined the term inhospitable transparency to describe the challenges of searching and filtering publicly available information (Marques et al., 2019). This is one example of what Fung described as lack of accessibility (Fung, 2013). Those hindrances are in line with what Marshall and team have nominated as distracting transparency strategy, in which companies overload stakeholders with data either because they do not know what to prioritize, or to deliberately drive stakeholder attention to selected prac tices, as a marketing strategy: something increasingly labelled as greenwashing (Marshall et al., 2016). Sometimes Firm - supplier cooperation has complex trade -offs, as it enhances internal transparency, but might lead to lower supply network transparency. These actions might also lead to greenwashing accusations (Egels -Zandén et al., 2015). In developing countries, other challenges might emerge. More specifically in Brazil, a study identified problematic factors such as lack of infrastructure, corruption, p ressing social issues, and informality. This context reduces trust and hinder learning, innovation and sustainability across the supply network (Silvestre,", "2.3 A SIGNALING LENS TO SUPPLY NETWO RK TRANSPARENCY", "Signaling theory analyses how communicatio n is made when there is an asymmetry of information between two or more parts involved. One part is interested in receiving information (Receiver). The other part (Signaler) holds this information and can decide how it is going to be disclosed. Signaling t heory can help understand the quality of the signal, and how receivers perceive it and how they provide feedback (Connelly et al., 2011). Studies have been conducted to analyze correlations between signals provided by CSR reports, signaling legitimacy (Chi ng & Gerab, 2017) and capabilities (Su et al., 2016). Although each day more companies are recognizing the importance of improving their CSR disclosure, they still face difficulties in structuring their actions and communications. The lack of elements such as information inside the supply -chain, supplier education and standards for reporting are some of the common limitations to provide supply -chain transparency (Marshall et al., 2016).", "The contrast between signaling theory which is focused on positive com munication (Connelly et al., 2011), and transparency, which for Fung (2013) refers to the disclosure of information that could affect citizens’ vital interests, sheds light on the tension experienced by companies. Aiming to signal sustainability, these fir ms find themselves bound to disclose the necessary information without selecting positive aspects.", "The present study adds to the existing literature on signaling theory and supply network transparency, by integrating these theories to discuss the develop ment and improvement of supply network transparency. By combining their concepts (see Table 1), the objective is to observe in which ways information is being diffused according to Signaling theory (Connelly et al., 2011) to demonstrate to sustainability, and understanding its content under the concepts of transparency proposed by Fung and Egels -Zandén and team (Fung, 2013; Egels -Zandén et al., 2015) . Table 1 describes how these theories are integrated and build the theoretical framework for this research.", "Results bring insights on trends in the way Brazilian fashion brands are disclosing sustainability information and can be used as references for professionals that are looking for cases , to contrast their initiatives to the ones applied by prominent brands in the sector.", "Table 1 – Theories and Concepts Signaling Theory Transparency (Connelly et al. , 2011) (Fung, 2013) (Egels -Zandén et Signalers Insiders that hold information not available to outsiders Signals Delibera te communication of positive information Signal observability Extent to which outsiders are able to notice the signal Availability Information citizens need to protect their vital interests should be available to them Proportionality What kinds of data merit the greatest democratic efforts to collect, publicize, analyze, and utilize?

Information that does not alter decisions and actions of its audiences —or its targets — cannot fulfill the central aim of Infotopia: to provide information that enables citizens to protect their vital interests.", "3. METHODOLOGY", "3.1 RESEARCH DESIGN", "In order to answer the RQ “How do Brazilian fashion brands signal sustainability through supply network transparency? ” a qualitative and inductive approach was conducted. This study frames the fashion brands as signalers within the signaling theory terminology . To analyze their signals, the study fo cused on the information disclosed on their official websites. Stakeholders were considered as the receivers . By integrat ing th is theory with transparency concepts developed in the work of Fung (2013) and Egels -Zandén et al. (2015) , five analytical questi ons (AQ) were proposed to approach transparency practices adopted by the companies that are part of the sample. The initial idea was to designate at least one question to each line of the theoretical framework available in Table 1. However, since the work is based o nly in public information provided by the brands in their websites, these questions are related to the signalers’ dimension , as displayed in table 2.", "Table 2 – Theories and analytical questions Signaling Theory Transparen cy Analytical Questions (AQ) (Connelly et al. , 2011) (Fung, 2013) (Egels -Zandén et Signalers Signals Signal Observability Availability What are the words used to inform sustainability?", "Where is sustainability positioned on the site?

Is that signa l aimed at the target receivers analyzed on this research ( Brazilian stakeholders )? AQ 2 - In which level of the website are sustainability information provided? The place where the information is located in their websites are characteristics of their availability, and also signal observability. By understanding that information could have multiple audiences, on this work the perspective will be focused on how Brazilian stakeholders have access to it.", "AQ 3 - Up to which tier of supplier is tracked and inf ormed on their website? Applying the con cept of proportionality proposed by Fung (2013), in this study it will be consider ed that the levels in which companies can look upstream their supply networks should be proportional to the risk they provide. This w ill be assessed on how companies list their suppliers, and up to which tier.", "AQ 4 - Do the companies provide sustainability reports, or audit r eports, or other information about suppliers?", "To observe the concept of sustainability conditions at supplier (Egels-Zandén et al., 2015) , the research will analyze what kind of documents the companies disclose about their suppliers . In this question both social and environmental conditions are considered. Examples should include what requirements suppliers must com ply, audit reports and others. In this question it is considered to be included aspects of the concepts of traceability (Egels - Zandén et al., 2015) and proportionality (Fung, 2013) .", "AQ 5 - What information are disclosed about the buying firm?", "This stud y is looking at transparency in the whole chain, not only at the suppliers, so it is also ask ed to what extent buying firm purchasing practices are being disclosed by themselves (Egels -Zandén et al., 2015) .", "To achieve this , a thorough description of the m ethod will be done, as proposed by Gioia et al. (2012) and similar to the detailed process record in the work developed by Marques, Yan and Matthews (2020).", "3.2 SAMPLE", "The sample was chosen based on the Brazilian edition s of the Fashion Transparen cy Index (FT I). The FTI is a survey containing famous fashion brands that operate in Brazil , conducted by Fashion Revolution, an NGO that advocates for more transparency in the fashion business (Fashion Revolution, 2018, 2019). Only companies that participated in the 2018 and 2019 editions of the Brazilian FTI were selected , as described in table 2. According to Fashion Revolution’s methodology (Fashion Revolution, 2018, 2019), they were chosen mainly because of their popularity (top of mind), but also considering their revenues and presence in different fashion segments.", "This sample was selected for this study for two reasons. First, because of the methodology applied by Fashion Revolution Brazil, since they use only public information provided by the own companies, a nd that is also how this study collected data. The FTI survey starts with the researchers looking for information in websites and reports. Then, the questionnaires are sent to these surv eyed brands in order to complete information that were not found initi ally. The companies that were chosen to participate in the Fashion Transpa rency Index are listed in the final report produced by them , even if they choose to not answer the questionnaires, since the research is based on public information (Fashion Revoluti on, 2018).", "Second, because companies in the sample already know that they are on the spotlight for transparency, at least for two ye ars. Since fashion brands are numerous and heterogeneous in a country like B razil, made sense to use Fashion Revolution’s c riteria to create our sample . Some of the companies had information linked in their corporate group website.

The objective is to find out how companies are using supply network transparency to address the information asymmetry bet ween them and their", "stakeholders , signaling sustainability. To do that, public information provided by them a t their websites will be considered, in this study, as their sustainability signals. Sustainability, CSR and transparency literature has many studies relying in sustainability reports and annual reports as source of information , such as Ali and Frynas (2018) and Mejías et al. (201 9), and also self -reported informat ion on companies’ websites, as in Jose & Lee (2007) , and Marshall et al. (2016).", "Data collec tion in the brands’ official websites was conducted initially during June and July 2020. The whole process of searching for susta inability information is described as follows. At first, the main objective was to fin d the word “sustentabilidade” (sustainability in Portuguese) in the first page. There could be a bias in searching for this word, since this is the main topic of the rese arch. However, in early stages of data gathering, it became clear that there was not a uniformity in this aspect, and that each company would choose specific words to describe sustainability , an d they did not necessarily position sustainability information in the first page. After the first few visits to brands‘ websites , it was found that this information could be placed in different areas. So that is why the questions “What are the words used to describe su stainability?”, and “ Where are susta inability inf ormation positioned on their websites?” emerged.", "A first attempt to systematize this search was to define some words I would preferably look for. I will list the words in Portuguese, since that wa s how the research was made, followed by their translation t o English. As I mentioned before, the priority was to find “Susten tabilidade ” (sustainability) or also “fornecedores” (suppliers), since the focus of t his work in on supply network transparency. Where these could not be found, I started looking for “ética” (ethics), “investidore s” (investors), “institucional” (institutional), “valores” (values), or “sobre a empresa” (about the company), since those are words companies frequently use to disclose information that are not aimed at selling products. Finally, if none of the previous were found, I would take the search to their corporate website, if it were linked somewhere in the bran d’s sites. This was done because in some cases corporations that own multiple brands offer information at the corporate level, such as Inditex for Zara, for example.", "In each company website I opened every link that could be related to the words mentioned in the previous paragraph. Since the internet is dynamic and there could be changes or updates along the research period, each webpa ge were printed in PDF for further analysis. In websites which contained animations or some other ki nd of format that would not appear clearly in the pdf printing, I took screenshots to save the images. Where files for download were available, I saved them . Everything that could be related to sustainability practices was downloaded for later analysis.", "Each of these files were saved inside a folder, with the ir respective brand name. The files were catalogued in a spreadsheet called “file control” , with the brands name, preceded by a number . The numbering was to replicate the sequence of actions I performed on the website. In this spreadsheet I also registered the web address and date of retrieval. Any initial observation about a website that could be relevan t in this first moment was also registered, such as a broken link, for example.", "The sequence of brands that were visited were random. I tried to capture all files from each given brand in a single visit , when that was possible. I downloaded all the materia l and later imported it to software NVivo, to only then start coding it . However, there were occasions which during the analysis I needed to re -visit a website if I saw something that I thought I missed in the first visit. In this case I printed in PDF the new material, and also added to the file control spreadsheet with the respective date of retrieval.", "3.4 DATA ANALYSIS", "The method employed for data analysis has balance d the need to develop new concepts and high rigor to conduct the research, as proposed b y Gioia, Corley and Hamilton (2012). The objective was to observe the range of practices and identify new approaches, like in the work of Stevenson and Cole (2018) . An inductive approach is taken to better understand the disclosure of practices (signals) o f those companies (signalers) to their stakeholde rs (receivers) , based on concepts of signal ing theory (Connelly et al., 2011) . The available information about sustainability practices w ere interpreted as their signals, relating", "them to aspects of transpar ency (Egels -Zandén et al., 2015; Fung, 2013). To deepen the knowledge about transparency in the Brazilian fashion sector, this study investigated how fashion brands signal their sustainability, through information disclosure about their supply network s.", "Content analys is was the chosen tool to analyze the material available on the companies’ websites. This method has been largely applied in qualitative studies encompassing sustainability, transparency, and CSR (Ali & Frynas, 2018; Jose & Lee, 2007; Mejías et al., 2019). The work of Gioia et al. (2012) was the reference for th is method . Their orientations were adapted for this method description, as they encourage to report both informant and researcher’s voice to provide solid demonstration on how links betwe en the data and the induction of insights were built. Since this research do not encompass interviews and is based solely in websites public information, this section registers both information about the data collection and analysis processes, and also researcher s’ notes and impressions during the coding.", "Coding started in September 2020 , using NVivo 12 software. Initially, nodes were created for each AQ. As previously mentioned, for some AQs there was already some expected result , such as words to define s ustainability in AQ1. For those , secondary nodes were created since the beginning . Then a process of reading each file started . While doing it, pieces of information that could be linked to one or more analytical questio ns, were directed to its nodes . That was how most of the codes were created. The d ate of the first analysis of each file is also available in the file control spreadsheet. Going through the material , occasionally I wou ld come across words, links or other information that had not been noticed in the first visi t to the website , but could be pointing to sustainability information. To check that, in these ca ses the website was visited again, and the information found was printed . Those files were also listed in the file control spreadsheet, with their date of collection. The final number of files analyzed was 305.", "All suppliers lists that were available in excel spreadsheets were converted to PDF to be coded at N Vivo. Although NVivo has the option of converting excel spreadsheets into", "tables, this is done to support the analysis of the content of the whole spreadsheet. To the purpose of this study, it was not necessary to go through the whole content of the file. Only the first line ( title of each column ) was needed, so that the kind of information buying firms are disclosing about their suppliers could be described . Therefore, the PDF file was the chosen source for coding.", "The process of coding was concluded after reading each document, at least twice. During t he first reading, information found was categorized in words that could e ither be fitted inside the analytical questions, or in new categories that emerged. During the process of reading and coding all these documents, similarities among them was being perceived . Sometimes it was i n the conten t itself, and other times it was in the format used to disclose it , and that generated new codes . When that happened, some previous documents were visited again to receive these additional codes . After the creation of a considerable number of codes, they s tarted being grouped in categories.", "Then started a process of organizing the categories inside each AQ, and also looking at the other categories that emerged. Some of th e emerging codes were relocat ed to a corresponding AQ. To others, a new theme was creat ed. Fin ally, the ones that were not directly related to the discussion of this research were put apart under a theme c alled “Understanding the context”. They were kept because they helped to develop the reason ing behind the main findings, but their content will not be subject to discuss ion in this research. Finally, it was reached a point where the final framework was designed . Looking at the practices, it became clear that some were straightforward and transparent while others might at some level show good intention, but without being so objective . The practices were then compared to each other to enable the creation of parameters to rank them according to their level of transparenc y.", "To sort transparency levels, Lamming et al. (200 1) proposition for trans parency categorization was used, in which they use geological’s property of how light penetrates through substances as a metaphor to indicate how information is shared in supply chain. The", "practices were therefore sorted as opaque , for low transparency ; translucent , for medium transparency and transparent , for high transparency.", "I also found that one theme that emerged , Educative Content , could actually fit in the first theoretical framework presented in Table 1 , filling the dimension of receivers and sign al feedback. Although that was not something I was actively looking for , I found that this kind of information could impact both companies and stakeholders, in a feedback mechanism, just like described previously in Table 1. After finishing this framing al l documents were reviewed , to be more precise at coding them under these categories and themes .", "4.

Almost all brands in that category ar e the ones which score d zero in both 2018 and 2019 editions of the Brazilian FTI. The exception is Zara, which has a link for their corporate group page (Inditex) where a sustainability report is avail able, but it was considered as inaccessible , since the focus of this research is on how information is available for Brazilian stakeholders , and the content was not available in Portuguese.", "It would be a challenge to define if some words alone could be ranked as more or less transparent th an others. Sustainabi lity was the most frequent word to present sustainability information. But other words also pointed to sustainability information, as found in these examples: “institutional” , at Havaianas, Malwee and Marisa; “values” in Ellus, and “ethics” in Osklen . There was an interesting exam ple at Riachuelo’s website. The link that took to sustainability information was called “ Moda que transforma ”, which can be translated to something like: “Fashion that causes transformation ”.", "In some websites, more than one of t he aforementioned words could appear in their pages, point ing to different and complementing information. Since sustainability has many different meanings and dimensions, it can lead to different outcomes. At Havaianas’ website", "for example, the word “susta inability” is positioned in the homepage, and it displays the brand’s initiatives that financially support institutions that help preserv ing the environment. The information I was actually looking for , abou t suppliers , was available at a link called “Polít icas”, which can be translated as “ policies”. The same word “Pol íticas ” appeared at Farm’s homepage, however it referred to sales po licies and was about commercial relationship between the brand’s and their final customers .

So, if companies embrace the challenge of mapping one more tier of suppliers, it was considered as translucent , such as C&A, Malwee, Marisa and Renner. This was assessed by analyzing the supplier’s list, where available . High level of transparency was considered for those brands that ma naged to map and disclose at least one tier -3 supplier or beyond, such as Osklen and Riachuelo.", "This classification has its limitations. One of the questionings is that some companies might not even have a third tier in their supply chain to map. Th at was one of the reflections made while deciding where to cat egorize suppliers lists from companies that stated mapping 100% of both their tier -1 and tier-2 suppliers , like Renner and C&A. For lack of more details of how their supply network is structured, those cases were established as translucent . A possible classification could be that, if a firm is capable of mapping 100% of their suppliers in all tiers of their supply network, then it shou ld be considered as transparent . Another aspect that stood out , was additional information disclosed about the suppliers in those lists. In most cases , the lists disclose mainly name , contacts ( address or phone) and type of product or service.

Considering the content of our sample’s websites, it was noted that companies have been making efforts in looking into the ir supply networks and disclosing informa tion. However, their own purchasing practices are not being tackled in the same proportion. The impression is that companies see themselves as an actor apart from the supply network , when the y act ually are one of the main players in it. Lack of standards i s a difficulty that many companies face when trying to improve their disclosure practices (Marshall et al ., 2016). Since this is a sample that h as been participating in a fashion transparency index for two years, it makes sense to infer that the FTI is one of their references. In the 2018 edition (Fashion Revolution, 2018) there were no specific questions about purchasing practices, only some questions in Section 5 , which referred to workers payment and that could be a source for improvement of purchasing policies . In 2019, they were specific by introducing six questions about purchasing practices and suppliers’ payments. Each one was worth one point, six points in total. Out of the 30 brands that have participated in the 2019 edition, only three addressed t his topic, and they", "only scored one point each (Fashion Revolution, 2019) . This reinforces the impression of under -disclosure of this practice.", "Since it was so hard to find straightforward information, and the objective of this work is to contribute with e xamples and alternatives that can help companies develop their own practices, the idea was then to search for other actions that could be paving the way to increase disclosure in purchasing practices. By presen ting them according to levels of transparency, we expect to offer some guidance for companies that wish to make progress in this aspect.", "Practices that fulfil minimum expectations about buying firm -suppli er relationship were classified as opaque , such as disclosing main guidelines for becoming a suppl ier and which steps the supplier must go through to be registered.

C&A, Marisa and Renner, require d a minimum production capacity. Renner ask ed also for some physical space specification s. Osklen provide d a version of their basic contract with suppliers. Malwee disclose d instruction s for subcontracting. This kind of in formation makes the relation between buying firm and suppliers clearer and predictable.", "Highest levels of transparency practices were associated with payment schedules , such as disclosed by Animale, and disc losure of other purchasing policies or rules . C&A’s example in this topic is interesting, firstly, because in their Sustainability Report they acknowledge the buying firm’s responsibility in organizing orders in a way that suppliers can", "deliver it, without the need of extra -hours , which Stevenson and Col e (2018) mentioned in their work that few companies do. Secondly, because t hey participated in the creation of a tool in partnership with Act on Living Wages (ACT) to self -evaluate their purchasing practices, and adhere d to its list of commitments, availab le on the ACT website, which proposes purcha sing practices that might improve supplier -buying firm relation (ACT, 2020) . Other isolated practices are worth mentioning and were considered as high transparency. C&A presents their concern in buying some certi ficated raw material that guarantee sustainable practices from selected suppliers. Farm mentions visits to check if orders are compatible with suppliers ’ capacity. Malwee has a str ategic partnership program to develop closer relation to suppliers and allow negotiations to be more transparent . Another dimension that has been added by this study to buying firm purchasing practices is how they disclose the ir future plans.

Two reflections can be done here. First, although the signal exists, it was not aimed at the study’s target : Brazilian stakeholders .

Many brands have disclosed supplier lists. However, there still are many companies that disclose only tier-1 suppliers . As observed by Khurana and Ricchetti ( 2016 ), full transparency must go beyond the first tier.

In terms of supplier audits, although this expression was frequently cited, in many cases information about frequency, requirements or detailed results were absent . This does not meet the Clean Clothes Campaign proposition (2020) which emphasizes t hat quantitative information should be conside red as one step ahead in supply network transparency.", "The lack of information on buying firm purchasing practices was one of the main findings of this work. This aspect was proposed by Egels -Zand én et al . as a dimension of transparency (2015). However, it is possible to see that the demand for this kind of information has been gaining more importance lately . Miem czyk et al. (2012) mention that most cited practices were more concentrated in function s such as suppliers’ selection and assessment . In Marshall et al. study (2016 ), buying firm purchasing practices were not cited among the main criteria proposed for a supply network disclosure strategy. Clean Clothes Campaign (2020) in their Position Paper on Transparency 2020, review their propositions made in th eir previous version of this paper in 2016, which did not encompass purchasin g or", "pricing policies . They have included this guideline in 2020 , calling it economic information . In the Fashion Tran sparency Index 2018, buying policies were not explicitly appr oached, but in 2019 , a section with six questions on buying policies was included . The lack of standards is usually one of the obstacles for implemen ting transparency (Marshall et al., 2016 ), therefore once this topic gains increased importance, disclosure will probably follow . In 2020 , due to the COVID -19 epidemy and lockdowns , the issue of orders cancell ation by major brands gained importance . Cancellation has a huge impact on suppliers once they buy material and allocate personnel for the purchasing or der (Forbes, 2020; The Guardian, 2020). If companies are to improve their supply network transparency in this dimension, order s planning , cancellation and payment policies should be among disclosed information .", "Next, the empirical findings are contrasted t o Fung’s (2013) concept of proportionality, where it was expected that fashion brands need ed to balance risks and opportunities to develop supply network transparency , but pressures have been increasing d ue to the ir economic importance (Common Objective, 2 019; Apex, 2020 , Tex Brasil, 2020) and social and environment al impact (Ellen Mc Arthur Foundation, 2017) . In this dimension, it was found great heterogeneity in practices and levels of transparency, as described in the previous section.", "In the availabilit y dimension, the surprising finding was that there were six brands websites where no sustainability information could be found at all. This is what in this research we labeled as absence of signals, and our conclusion is that for th ese brands, websites are not being prioritized as a means to signal sustainability to their stakeholders . The dimensions of accessibility and actionability proposed by Fung (2013) initially were not going to be addressed on this research, since they are based on the receivers’ dimensio n. However, data analysis allowed the identification of attempts by some brands to develop educative content, which are aimed at stakeholders/receivers.", "First, there was a relevant effort by brands in at least sharing their view on sustainability on the website . This not only enables the beginning of a dialogue with their", "audience , as stakeholders can compare their brands priorities with their own , but also can be related to the accessibility concept (Fung, 2013) , since it is providing basic informati on and references so that customers can start learning about it .", "Some brands mentioned capturing customers ’ feedback through surveys and including it in their sustainability strategies . This displays a real participation of the stakeholder in the process. Finally some educative content focused in customer education could actually cause a change in the way they buy clothes. This is aligned to Fung’s (2013) concept of actionability, since customers have the power to act on th ese brands simply by choosing to buy or not from them, impacting these brands reve nues for better or for worse. Regarding signaling theory (Connelly et al., 2011) , the concept of observability was fulfilled by all companies that disclosed some information, since it were available publicly in the website. However, receiver’s attention, interpretation and countersignals could not be evaluated in this work, since customers were not surveyed.", "Some examples confirmed what signaling theory proposes, that the signal should be aimed at the receive r who is looking for information . An interesting finding was that different brands, even when they belong to a same group, might have different target audiences, different views of sustainability and , consequently , communicate it in different ways . For exa mple, Havaianas and Osklen, both part of Alpargatas group. Havaianas susta inability communication focus on environment preservation, and partnerships for financial support to institutions that work with that cause. Osklen is more focused on innovation and sustainability throughout their supply network, and positioning them as new luxury.", "Findings were similar for the brands of the sample that are part of Grupo Soma. Animale shares some information about their suppliers such as payment schedule and supplier list for tier 1. While Farm developed a diagram explaining main processes of the production with some information about where each of those steps are made. Anoth er aspect to be remarked in the present study and future ones combining signali ng theory and tr ansparency, is that, according to Connelly (2011), signaling theory is", "focused on the communicati on of positive aspects, and that confronts the concept of democratic transparency proposed by Fung (2013) which is about disclosure of information that could a ffect citizens’ vital interests . This is interesting because it replicates the tension that companies experience by increasing their transparency but also trying to balance it with their reputation and marketing stra tegies.", "The examples that were consolid ated in this study bring opportunity for deeper discussion of each dimension, both in the areas of sustainability, supply network and marketing. A complete framework with all theories, analytical questions and findings are available at Table 10.", "Table 10 – Research complete framework Signaling Theory Transparency AQ Main Findings - Level of Transparency (Connelly et al., 2011) (Fung, 2013) (Egels -Zandén et al, 2015) Opaque Translucent Transparent Signalers Signals Signal Obse rvability Availability Where is sustainability positioned on the site? - Not found - 3 or more clicks - 2 clicks - 1click Proportionality Traceability Up to which tier of supplier is tracked and informed? - Not found - Only tier 1 - 2 tiers - 3 tiers - 100% suppliers disclosure Sustainability conditions at supplier Do the companies provide sustainability reports or audit reports and other information about suppliers?

Concepts of transparency proposed by Egels -Zandén et al. (2015) was one of the references for this work by extrapolating basic traceability transparency to increase supplier sustainability conditions and incentivize buying -firm disclosures of purchasing practices. Fung’s (2013) concepts of Democratic Transparency , represents the citizen’s perspectives, expanding the traditional focus in buyer -supplier to a more holistic view on sustainability in supply networks, by incorporating stakeholders point of view. This holistic view was translated into this research’s framework, which is aligned to the broader definition of SSNM proposed by (Marques , 2019, p 1176) :", "The strategic, transparent integration of all supply network members, including both supply chain and non -supply chain members, through the systemic coordination of knowledge diffusion across vertical, horizontal and diagonal ties aiming at the achievemen t of the supply network’s social, environmental and economic goals. In this passage, some aspects should be highl ighted. The first is the term transparent, which is the base of this research, which relied in collecting information publicly available in the brand’s official websites. Both supply chain and non -supply chain members were addressed, since the study encompassed the relations between buying firm, suppliers and external stakeholders. Finally, aspects of knowledge diffusion were discussed, such as the imbalance between buying firms demands from suppliers, in contrast with their own lack of purchasing information. Th is study’s elements brought together gives a practical example of what was described in Fung (2013), Egels -Zandén et al. (2015) and Marq ues (2019) work. By analyzing the dispersion of these concepts under the principles of Signaling Theory, which is focused on positive communication, this research differs from the traditional approach on signaling theory, which is focused in positive aspec ts, to shed light on the tension experienced by companies, balancing opportunities and trade -offs between", "reputation and transparency. Once again it is remarkable the need to bring together consumer’s demands and internal processes in business studies. The main finding was that although companies are presenting their concerns about sustainability and publicizing their standards and demands towards suppliers, in many cases there is a significant difference between what they ask of their suppliers, and what they disclose about their own purchasing practices. The dimension of buying firm purchasing practices was clearly lagging behind the others.", "It was considered that i n general, brands that are clear and demanding towards their suppliers are just halfway tow ards transparency. Since companies operate inside the supply network, the participation of the buying firm in disclosing their own practices has an important weight in transparency .", "6.2 MANAGERIAL IMPLICATI ONS", "The main contribution of this work for practition ers is that it could serve as a reference for both sustainability and marketing professionals in the fashion sector that are looking for references in how to disclose their information and how to compare their actions to what top brands are currently doing . By analyzing their own practices, these professionals can have an idea how they are positioned in terms of transparency.", "The practices were categorized according to their level of transparency, as low, medium and high, respectively labelled as opaque, tr anslucent and transparent. This structure provides guidance for professionals on how to implement practices . The framework is built in a way that opaque mean s more basic and more simple actions to engage. Translucent are intermediary practices, and transpa rent are more complex and sophisticated . This study also highlighted interesting practices that could serve as benchmark for these practitioners.", "For NGO s it could serve as an indicator of which practices could be in their radar and which of them need clea rer metrics. Since the lack of standards is frequently pointed as one", "of the difficulties for information disclosure (Marshall et al., 2016), this could help setting standards that would facilitate sustainability development in fashion sector as a whole. Collective efforts in setting standards, such as: m any companies from the sample demanding Abvtex certification from suppliers and development of Open Apparel Registry tool f or supplier mapping , shows that there are broad possibilities to improve sustainabi lity and transparency in the sector through brands collaboration .", "6.3 LIMITATIONS", "To observe how fashion brands signal sustainability, this study focused on how brands communicate d their practices that involve their supply network, their concerns about it, an d how they disclose d this information. The objective was to observe how sustainability is being signaled through supply network transparency .", "To the scope of this research it has been defined that the search of these practices would be limited to the bran ds official websites. This choice has two major implications: the first, is that other relevant channels such as social media have been left out of this observation. Second, that the target audience of the websites are broad, not being possible to clearly identify to which stakeholder the information are aimed to. It is also important to highlight that t he practices were not audited, and neither their effectiveness was subject to analysis. The focus was on the disclosure of sustainable practices, however wi thout investigating if there were not unsustainable ones that were not being mentioned, or if greenwashing was happening . It it is not the objective of this research to assess the level of transparency of each bran d, but looking at isolated practices allow ed to establish a comparison among them and sort their initiatives according to the level of transparency of each practice.", "The material was collected only in 2020, so there is not a record from previous years that could allow comparison, or verify the ev olution in these practices. The observation of receivers dimension in this system w as limited to how companies described or directed their information towards the website’s users, being generally defined", "as stakeholders . But it was not possible to define s pecific target audiences, and s urvey them , so their point of view are not explicit.", "6.4 FUTURE RESEARCH", "The signals were identified by analyzing the brands’ official website s. Nevertheless, other chan nels have been gaining imp ortance, like social networks, and could also be a source for research in the future. Specially in the cases where there was absence of signals, further analysis could be possible by either checking other communication channels those brands might have, or by interviewing their managemen t team.", "The analysis was based in the material found on websites in 2020. Following along some years could allow a longitudinal study to deepe n the analysis of progress in practices and in communication through time.", "The complete framework designed by merg ing signaling theory concepts by Connelly et al. (2011), and Fung’s (2013) and Egels -Zandéns’ et al. (2015) concepts of transparency provided a broad view on how signalers build signals of sustainability and transparency, having stakeholders as receivers. Future research can approach receivers’ interpretation and feedback from specific stakeholders such as customers, investors and governments.", "REFERENCES Abvtex, (2020).

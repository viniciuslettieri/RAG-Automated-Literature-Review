Gon\u0018 calves & Dr. Stavros Akras Planetary nebulae (PNe) and symbiotic stars (SySt) are well known emission-line objects that represent the \fnal stages in the evolution of low- and intermediate-mass stars. From the approximately 3,500 PNe and 300 SySt discovered in our Galaxy, only fourteen PNe and a handful SySt are known to be members of the Galactic halo. Nevertheless, a systematic search for halo PNe and SySt has never been performed. This thesis presents photometric tools and the very \frst results of searching for Galactic halo compact PNe and SySt in the J-PLUS (Javalambre Photometric Lo- cal Universe Survey) and S- PLUS (Southern-Photometric Local Universe Survey) \frst data releases (DR1). The objective of this work is the elaboration, development and validation of new photometric diagnostic tools to identify PNe and SySt making use of the novel 12-\flter system of the J-PLUS and S-PLUS projects. For that, syn- thetic photometry for a grid of photo-ionization models of halo PNe, few observed halo PNe and SySt, as well as a number of emission-line objects that resemble PNe and SySt (star-forming galaxies, cataclysmic variables, quasi-stellar objects, extra- galactic H iiregions, B[e] stars and young stellar objects) were computed. The thesis also devises such tools for the forthcoming Javalambre-Physics of the Accelerating Universe Astrophysical Survey (J-PAS). In addition, principal component analysis (PCA) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) are explored as supplementary tools to better discriminate PNe and SySt from their emission-line mimics. The J-PLUS and S-PLUS colour-colour diagnostic diagrams are validated using two known halo PNe observed by J-PLUS during the science veri\fcation phase and by applying the new criteria to the DR1s of J-PLUS and S-PLUS. One PN candidate was identi\fed, in the J-PLUS DR1, of which the optical follow-up spectroscopy is discussed. No other candidates, either of PNe or SySt are found, probably due to the short area so far observed ( \u00181;190 deg2). Although, the new selection criteria recovered three known strong emission-line objects { one PN and two H iigalaxies { in this area. These objects were used to validate the performance of the statistical techniques. The selection of tools devised in this work for the identi\fcation and discrimination of PNe and SySt from their emission-line mimics proved to be very e\u000ecient due to the 12-\flter systems of the surveys and the combination of various optical colour indices.", "Kew-words: Final stages of stellar evolution, emission-line objects, photometric surveys, planetary nebulae, symbiotic stars, technique: photometry, spectroscopy List of Figures 3.10 Six J-PAS colour-colour diagrams to separate PNe and SySt from 3.12 ( Upper panel ) J-PLUS PC2 vs PC1 and ( lower panel ) PC3 vs PC1 3.13 J-PAS PC2 vs PC1 ( upper panel ) and PC3 vs PC1 ( lower panel ) 3.16 ( Upper panel ) J-PLUS LD2 vs LD1 and ( lower panel ) LD3 vs LD1 4.2 J-PLUS ( r\u0000J0660) vs (r\u0000i) colour-colour diagram with objects 4.4 The photo-spectrum and 3RGB colour ( g,randi) image of the J- 4.7 J-PLUS photo-spectra and corresponding composite images of HASH List of Tables", "4.2 Emission line", "uxes of the J-PLUS PN candidate in UGC 5272. . . . 96 4.3 J-PLUS and S-PLUS, SDSS and Pan-STARRS photometry for the B.1 Abundances used to computed the grid of modelled spectra . . . . . 144 Contents 1.4.8 Diagnostic diagrams: separating PNe and SySt from other", "2 Description of the surveys", "2.2 Multi-band photometric surveys: a new era for planetary nebula and", "3 Photometric techniques", "4 Applying the techniques to the observational data", "5 Discussions, conclusions and perspectives", "B Chemical abundances used to build the PN models . . . . . . . . . 144 Chapter 1 Introduction Planetary nebulae and symbiotic stars are some of the most interesting and fascinat- ing objects of the universe. Planetary nebulae are bubbles of ionized gas, produced from low- and intermediate-mass stars towards the end of their evolution. They represent evolutionary phase in the lifetimes of a signi\fcant fraction of Milky Way (MW) stars. Approximately 3,500 PNe have been identi\fed in the Milky Way, but only 14 are located in the Galactic halo. Halo PNe are interesting objects because they provide important clues about the \fnal evolution of old, low-mass halo stars and they are able to convey fundamental information of the early chemical conditions of the Galaxy including its star formation history. On the other hand, symbiotic stars are binary systems formed by an evolved cool giant star and an evolved hot star (in general a white dwarf). They are important objects in Astrophysics be- cause they allow the study of physical mechanisms such as the powering mechanism of supersoft X-ray sources, the thermonuclear outbursts, the collimation of stellar winds and formation of jets or their relation with the formation of bipolar PNe. Symbiotics are, probably, progenitors of Type Ia supernovae. In this work we have developed diagnostic tools to identify planetary nebulae and symbiotic stars in the Galactic halo by using photometric surveys that contain narrow- and broad-band \flters. These topics will be addressed in subsequent chapters in this thesis.", "1.1 Planetary nebulae (PNe)", "PNe are the result of the evolution of low- and intermediate-mass stars, with masses between 0:8 and 8:0 M\f. During their evolution, these stars go through many nu- cleosynthetical and mixing processes that change their initial surface composition. The central stars of PNe are evolved stars in the phase of white dwarfs with very high temperatures (typically \u00154\u0002104K), which have expelled in the interstellar medium large amount of their mass. This circumstellar envelope around the rem- nant stars expand with velocities of the order of \u001830 km/s. Due to this expansion, the density of PNe decreases with time resulting in weak emission. This process makes PNe to become rapidly very faint and un-detectable. The PN phase is very short (\u001820;000\u000030;000 yr) compared to the entire lifetime of the star. Tools to discover planetary and symbiotic nebulae Chapter 1 Figure 1.1: Herzsprung-Russel diagram of a 2 M \fevolutionary track from the main sequence to the white dwarf phase (red track) for a solar metalicity star. The blue track indicates a born-again evolution (triggered by a very late thermal pulse) for the same mass, but slightly o\u000bset in log Tand logL. The red and green stars represent the position of the central star of NGC 6853 (H-rich) and the naked PN nucleus PG 1159-035 (H-de\fcient), respectively. Shaded areas represent the covered range in log Tand logLin each evolutionary stage of the star and the numerical labels with refer to the log of the approximate duration of each evolutionary phase. In the cooler section of the post-AGB phase, wiggles in the track are caused by numerical convergence di\u000eculties (Herwig, 2005). In short, at the end of the evolution of low- and intermediate-mass stars, their outer layers are ejected resulting in an enrichment of the interstellar medium (ISM) with heavy elements (Karakas & Lattanzio, 2014). Note that PN phase is reached when the previously ejected material is eventually ionized by the UV radiation \feld of the central star before being diluted in the ISM. The ionized gas contains information about the chemical composition at the time and the place the progenitor stars were formed and gives chemical clues of the former stellar nucleosynthesis. 1.1.1 Detailing the origin of the planetary nebulae In the main-sequence (MS) phase, low- and intermediate-mass stars spend most of the time converting hydrogen into4He in the their cores, by nuclear fusion. In the end of the MS phase, stars begin to exhaust the hydrogen in the nucleus. Then the radiation pressure is not enough to stop the gravitational collapse. When the nucleus starts to compress, its temperature increase causing that the outer layer of the star expand. The star now moves away from the main sequence and climbs up the \frst red giant branch (RGB) in the Hertzsprung-Russell (HR) diagram. During this phase the luminosity increases considerably, by a factor of \u0018103for a solar-mass MS star, the super\fcial area of the star also increases distributing the released energy Chapter 1 Tools to discover planetary and symbiotic nebulae over a much larger surface area, so the surface cools to an e\u000bective temperature around 3,500 K (corresponding to a M spectral type), this is a direct consequence of the Stefan-Boltzmann law. At this point the star is in the phase known as \frst- ascent red-giant branch (RGB). In Figure 1.1 we show a schematic description of the full evolution of intermediate-mass stars (2 M \f) in the HR diagram. In the RGB phase the outer layers become less gravitationally bound due to the large increase of the radius. This causes the mass-loss to accelerate (Reimers, 1975). Convection becomes the main mechanism of energy transport in the envelope due to the increased hydrogen opacity at lower temperatures. As the convection extends inwards, it can reach regions where there was early H burning, and hence CNO cycle producing14N from12C and16O. Therefore, the advance of the convective envelope produces an increase of14N and simultaneous decrease in12C and16O in the envelope; this process is called \frst dredge up . In low-mass stars (M <2 M\f), after the MS phase, the He core becomes denser, hotter and electron-degenerate. When the temperature in the degenerated core is high enough to trigger the He burning { via the triple \u000breaction { the energy released increases the temperature in the core, as the core can not expand given to degenerate state. Therefore, the burning rate increases rapidly ending up as thermonuclear runaway. This process is known as the core helium ash (Iben & Renzini, 1983; Herwig, 2005). The energy released by the ash changes the equation of state in the core. The core leaves the degenerated state and is dominated by the equation of an ideal gas. It takes more than one of these ashes to remove the degeneracy in the nucleus. After the He ash becomes weaker in the core, it eventually reaches a steady He burning. This mean that the star rapidly cools and becomes less luminous, moving left down in the HR diagram, thus arriving on the zero-age horizontal branch (ZAHB, see Figure 1.1). The more massive stars (2 M \f<M<8 M\f) do not form a degenerate nucleus and hence do not have the He ash, but these stars eventually have He ignition1 in the center getting a central C + O-rich core, an intermediate He-rich region and an outer H-rich zone. There are He-burning and H-burning shell sources at the inner edges, and the star evolves with an increasing luminosity and decreasing temperature along the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) and towards the red giant tip again.", "As the He is exhausted in the core the luminosity increases and the star cools down, returning to the second-ascent red giant. Given to the position of the evo- lutionary track of these stars in the HR diagram, they are called the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars. As the outer layers are becoming cold and less dense, the convection again is the dominant heat-transfer mechanism. The convective shell penetrates the H-burning shell, then it brings to the surface the primary resulting nucleosynthesis products of H burning (He plus14N from the CNO cycle), and this is the second dredge up . This process occurs only in stars with mass above \u00184M\f 1The stars have two energy sources: a He-burning core and a H-burning shell exterior to it. Tools to discover planetary and symbiotic nebulae Chapter 1 The AGB phase is divided into two sub-phases: the early-AGB (E-AGB) and the thermally pulsing AGB (TP-AGB). In the E-AGB the star consists of a degenerated CO core surrounded by a He-burning shell and this is surrounded by a convective hydrogen envelope. When the He-burning stops in the shell, the TP-AGB phase begins, characterized by a double shell of H and He that alternatively switch o\u000b and on to provide the energy source of the star. As the He is exhausted, the hydrogen shell is compressed and \fre up, exterior to the now dormant helium shell. Approximately every 105years, the helium shell becomes thick enough to trigger its ignition again by helium ashes or thermal pulses, causing the outer layers of the star to expand. The H burning is now pushed to upper zones where the temperature and density are lower, here the fusion stops. When the He in the inner shell is exhausted, the shell of hydrogen is compressed and its ignition begins again. Hence one dozen of thermal pulses occur during the TP-AGB phase (Herwig, 2005). TP-AGB stars are generally larger and more luminous than the RGB stars (the luminosity can exceed the 104L\f, and the diameters are in the order of 2 AU). The temperature can be as low as \u00182;500 K (spectral type M8). The internal instabilities in these objects make them to exhibit Mira variability (periodicity of \u00181 yr). The mass-loss is increased with the time, and after each thermal pulse, the processed materials are brought up to the surface via convection mechanism, what is called third dredge up . The surface becomes enriched with helium, CNO, and slow neutron capture (s-process) elements (Iben & Renzini, 1983, 1984; Herwig, 2005; Sterling & Dinerstein, 2008).", "Eventually, as the star leaves the AGB phase, it ejects almost all its outer layers in a \fnal and powerful mass-loss phase through stellar winds (Wachter et al., 2002). The \fnal stage of a planetary nebula can be recognized as a nebular shell that expands into the ISM, while the central star evolves to be a white dwarf. The expansion velocity of the nebular gas is approximately 33 km s\u00001(Pereira et al., 2013), which is very low in comparison with the escape velocity from the central stars, about 1,000 km s\u00001. It is, therefore quite unlikely that any impulsive process that throws o\u000b an outer shell from these stars would provide just a little more energy than the necessary escape energy. To explain that, the expansion velocities of the nebular shells are compatible with the escape velocities of the red giants, therefore suggesting that these shells are ejected during the red-giant phase (Osterbrock & Ferland, 2006). In fact, radiation pressure from the stellar continuum (observed in the infrared by the presence of dust) and the presence of the trapped L \u000bphotons can accelerate this expansion. Thus, the presence of dust in the PNe also suggests that the material in the shell comes from a cool stellar component, which further supports the evolution of PNe from red giant stars. There is a strong observational evidence that stars in the AGB phase lose mass by stellar winds. These winds have low velocities ( \u001810 km s\u00001) and relatively higher mass-loss rate, 10\u00005M\fyr\u00001. This process produces a large, cool and slowly expanding shell surrounding the central star.", "After most of the envelope mass has been expelled into the ISM, the hot core Chapter 1 Tools to discover planetary and symbiotic nebulae Figure 1.2: Schematic structure of a planetary nebula. It consists of three regions: the innermost zone with a fast wind ( \u0018103km s\u00001) from the hot core, an external shell with a slow wind (\u001810 km s\u00001) and an outermost layer composed by cool gas, molecules and dust.", "is exposed and a second and faster wind arises. The velocity of this wind is similar to the escape speed from the central star ( \u0018103km s\u00001) and it is driven by the radiation pressure, with smaller mass-loss rates, typically \u001810\u00008M\fyr\u00001. This new fast wind interacts with the cold and slowly-moving outer shell, producing a central cavity (Osterbrock & Ferland, 2006). Simultaneously the material is ionized by the UV strong radiation \feld of the central star. At this stage, the system consists of three regions, the innermost wind from the core, an external shell where the fast wind interacts with the material previously ejected from the cool star and an outermost layer of molecular species, as it is shown in Figure 1.2. Diverse PNe imaging catalogs have showed that they display a variety of mor- phologies, originated from stars with a range of masses, and the ejected envelopes are characterized by a wide range of abundances. Very few PNe exhibit spherically shape, while the vast majority show ellipsoidal or bipolar morphologies (e.g. Kwok, 2007; Balick & Frank, 2002) suggesting that the mass loss is more e\u000eciently in the poles of the central stars. Various mechanism have been proposed to explain the de- viation from the spherical symmetry such as magnetic \felds (Garc\u0013 \u0010a-Segura et al., 2005) or binary systems (e.g. Soker, 1998, 2002a). Over the last decades, it has been found that binary systems and the common envelope phase are crucial for the formation of non-spherical nebula (Balick & Frank, 2002). Faint outer shells have Tools to discover planetary and symbiotic nebulae Chapter 1 been observed well outside of the bright PNe, indicating the presence of multiple ejection processes (e.g. Iben & Tutukov, 1993).", "In order to understand the chemical abundances observed in PNe, we need to consider the processes that bring the processed elements to the stellar surface and then to the ejected PN. Overall, the \frst dredge up occurs when the H core of the star is exhaust and the star becomes a red giant. In this \frst dredge up the material enriched in N and diluted in C is brought to the surface layers. The second dredge up, following the exhaustion of central He and creation of a degenerate C + O core, results in a large amount of He and N mixed to the surface layers (this only occurs for stellar masses above \u00184 M\f). The third dredge up occurs when the He-burning occurs in a convective shell, and higher C abundances and lower N abundances are brought to the stellar surface by the thermal pulses. This is the situation at high metallicities, however, third dredge up contribution is important only for galaxies with the lowest metallicities (Gon\u0018 calves, 2019).", "1.1.2 Planetary nebulae spectra", "The high temperature of the central stars (CS) of PNe implies that most of their UV photons ux is blueward of the Lyman limit. The gas shell previously ejected in the AGB phase is photo-ionized and produces an emission-line spectrum. The principal emission lines in the optical region are the recombination lines of hydrogen and helium plus a few of the strongest lines of oxygen, nitrogen and carbon, and the prominent emission of collisionally-excited forbidden lines of heavy elements such as O, N, S, Ne, and Ar (Kwitter & Henry, 2001). In their spectra, it is also present a nebular continuum produced by recombination, two photon emission and free-free emission. The continuum tend to be more intense in the blue part. Planetary neb- ulae show a variety of optical spectra and have spectral features also in common with symbiotic stars, H iiregions, Wolf-Rayet stars and some supernova remnants PNe can be very low excitation objects with strong Balmer lines and [O II] emission, like BD +30\u000e3639 and He 2-131, in which the surrounding gas is ionized by a relatively cool star (T e\u000b'30;000 K). They can also be moderate and high excitation objects in which [O III] \u0015\u00154959;5007 lines are the dominant emission lines in the optical spectrum. There are also very high excitation PNe in which the [He II] emission-line is stronger than the H \fsuggesting a very hot central source. These PNe also exhibit [Ne V] lines and generally have little or no trace of low-ionization species such as [O II], [N II], and [S II]. Occasionally, the highest-excitation PNe show in their spectrum uorescent lines of O III and N III. In general PNe exhibit a wide range of excitation states. Their spectra can show emission lines from [O I] to [Ne V]. These PNe are often optically thick (Jacoby & Kaler, 1989; Kaler & Jacoby, 1989) and frequently have an extended molecular shell (e.g. Zuckerman & Gatley, In Figure 4.5 we show the optical spectrum of M 1-57, a typical middle-aged Chapter 1 Tools to discover planetary and symbiotic nebulae Figure 1.3: Flux-calibrated optical spectrum of the medium excitation PN Minkowski 1-57 (Kwitter & Henry, 2001). Important emission lines are indicated. PN. In this spectrum, it is possible to see a wide variety of low- and high-excitation emission lines. The term \\excitation class\" was introduced to explain the wide vari- ety of spectral signature of the PNe (Gurzadian & Egikian, 1991). The temperature of the CS is the primary parameter associated with the excitation class, but it can also be a\u000bected by other second-order parameters: the abundances of the elements (depending on the line species used in the de\fnition) and the optical depth of the PN, which re ects on the size and density of the PN shell.", "Aller (1956) de\fned a scale of semi-quantitative measure of the excitation of PN, a scale from 1 to 10. Strengths of the [O II] \u00153727 and [O III] \u00154959 lines relative to H\fwere used to de\fne low-excitation PNe, whilst the strength of He II \u00154686 and [Ne V] \u00153426 were used for high-excitation nebulae. Dopita & Meatheringham (1990) introduced the decimal excitation class and gave two equations depending on whether or not the He II emission is detectable. ( F[O III]5007 +F[O III]4959 )=FH\f is also used to measured the excitation class. This method has been adopted by Stanghellini et al. (2002a) where high-excitation He II lines were not available. More recently, Reid & Parker (2010) proposed a new method for estimating excitation classes incorporating both the [O III]/ H\fand the He II 4686 \u0017A/H\fratios.

They are associated with the thin disk and have approximately circular orbits. Members of this group are generally older than Type I PNe, having been formed at a time when the interstellar medium was more metal-poor in heavy elements. Therefore, they may present slight underabundances of elements such as O, S and Ne. Moreover, their low mass prevents strong He or N enrichments (Quireza et al., 2007). They have He/H <0.125 and log(N/O) <-0.3 (Peimbert, 1978). This group is subdivided in Type IIa withhzi= 280 pc andh\u0001Vi= 21:3 km s\u00001and Type IIb with hzi= 420 pc and Type III PNe are high velocity objects from the thick disk population with h\u0001Vi>60:0 km s\u00001. Such PNe were produced from stars generally older than most thin disk stars. As most of the thick disk stars, they are on moderately elliptical orbits that typically reach higher distances from the Galactic plane. The thick disk have a scale height of 1450 pc (Reddy et al., 2006). Type III nebulae should also present lower abundances of heavy elements than the thin disk stars. Finally, Type IV PNe are low metallicities objects. They exhibit hzi= 7:2 kpc andh\u0001Vi= 173 km s\u00001(Peimbert & Serrano, 1980; Peimbert & Torres-Peimbert, 1983). The hPNe are classi\fed as Type IV, due to the high vertical distance from the galactic plane and the large peculiar velocity relative to the rotation of the Galaxy (Costa et al., 1996). It should be noted that all halo PNe are found to be metal poor (Quireza et al., 2007). For instance, the halo PNe BoBn1 (Otsuka et al., 2010), H4-1 (Otsuka & Tajitsu, 2013) and K648 (Kwitter et al., 2003) are extremely low-metallicity sources, showing [Fe/H] \u0018-2.45 (Otsuka et al., 2015).

Many of these objects have been misconceived as compact PN in previous catalogs (see Acker et al., 1987). One of the most common PN mimic of stellar appearance are the symbiotic stars (SySt). The traditional def- inition of SySt cover those interacting systems that exhibit a composite spectrum with emission lines of H I and He I and often [O III] and He II in conjunction with absorption signatures present in evolved giant star (Kenyon, 1986; Belczy\u0013 nski et al., Tools to discover planetary and symbiotic nebulae Chapter 1", "1.2.1 Symbiotic stars nature", "Symbiotic stars (SySt) are long-period interacting binary systems, in which a late- type giant star transfer mass to a much hotter and compact companion. The typical con\fguration of a SySt consists of a red giant transferring material to a white dwarf star via stellar wind. Part of the wind of the giant star is ionized by the radiation of the WD, producing a spectrum with two components: one component is described by absorption features from the cool stellar photosphere of the giant and the second component by the emission lines of the excited ions (Corradi et al., 2008; Allen, 1984b). SySt are divided into three categories: ( i) The S-type ( stellar ) in which the giant has a M-spectral type and dominates the emission in the near-IR, showing the presence of stellar photospheres at 3 ;000\u00004;000 K (Belczy\u0013 nski et al., 2000; Akras et al., 2019a). ( ii) The D-type systems ( dusty ) in which the cool companion is a Mira variable star. The near-IR emission corresponds to the dusty envelope around the systems. And ( iii) D'-type symbiotic stars which are characterized by a F, G or K type cool giant surrounded by a dust shell (Allen, 1984a). An additional type of SySt namely S+IR, an S-type with an infrared excess in the 11.6 and/or 22.1 \u0016m bands, was just proposed by Akras et al. (2019a). SySt are important objects in Astrophysics because they allow the study of physical mechanisms such as the powering mechanism of supersoft X-ray sources (Jordan et al., 1996), the thermonuclear outbursts (Munari, 1997), the collimation of stellar winds and formation of jets (Tomov, 2003) or their relation with the formation of bipolar PNe (Corradi et al., 2003). Another important aspect is that SySt are, probably, progenitors of Type Ia supernovae (see e.g Whelan & Iben, 1973; Hachisu et al., 1999; L u et al., 2009; Di Stefano, 2010; Chen et al., 2011). Various catalogues of SySt have been generated over the last 40 years. Allen (1984a) made the \frst catalogue of these sources and 15 years later Belczy\u0013 nski et al. (2000) presented a more updated and comprehensive census of SySt. Last year, Akras et al. (2019b) presented the latest catalogue of SySt with all known members until 2018. So far, only 323 SySts are known, from which 257 are Galactic and 66 are extragalactic (Akras et al., 2019b). These numbers are considerably lower than the predicted number of SySt in the Galaxy, from 3,000 (Allen, 1984a) up to 4\u0002105(Magrini et al., 2003). However, a great e\u000bort has been made over the years to create and improve tools that allow to distinguish SySt from other H\u000bemitters including compact PNe. Corradi et al. (2008, 2010); Rodr\u0013 \u0010guez-Flores et al. (2014) identi\fed symbiotic star candidates using colour-colour diagrams built from IPHAS3and near-IR (2MASS4) catalogs. Later, follow-up observations were obtained to reveal the true nature of the sources. More recently, Akras et al. (2019a) presented a new approach for identifying and distinguishing SySt from other sources in photometric surveys using machine learning techniques such as classi\fcation tree, linear discriminant analysis and K-nearest neighbor. 3The INT/WFC Photometric H \u000bSurvey of the Northern Galactic Plane (Drew et al., 2005) 4Two Micron All-Sky Survey (Skrutskie et al., 1995) Chapter 1 Tools to discover planetary and symbiotic nebulae", "1.2.2 Symbiotic stars spectra", "As already mentioned, the spectra of the SySt are composed by emission lines pro- duced in the giant wind and absorption bands from the surface of the giant (Kenyon, 1986). The spectrum of a SySt displays strong recombination lines of H I, He I and He II as well as a number of forbidden high-excitation lines such as [O III] or [Ne V] and include typical forbidden emission lines of [O II], [Ne III] and [Fe VII]. The absorption component from the red giant includes bands such as TiO and VO, H 2O, CO and CN bands, as well as Ca I, Ca II, Fe I and Na I absorption lines (see, for instance, Gon\u0018 calves et al., 2015).", "SySt were found to exhibit two very broad lines at 6825 \u0017A and 7082 \u0017A. These lines are known as Raman O VI scattered lines. Schmid (1989) identi\fed them as produced by the Raman scattering of the O VI \u0015\u00151032;1038 resonance lines by neu- tral hydrogen. An incident O VI photon with frequency \u0017iexcite atomic hydrogen from its ground state 1 s2Sto an intermediate state from where the Raman photon \u0017fis emitted, leaving the hydrogen atom in the state 2 s2S.

The frequency displacement \u0001\u0017of the incoming O VI photons, due to Doppler broadening or any other phe- nomenon, is conserved. Therefore the relative widths \u0001 \u0017=\u0017fof the Raman lines are approximately 6.7 times larger than the \u0001 \u0017=\u0017iof the initial O VI lines, thus causing a large FWHM of \u001925\u0017A for the\u0015\u00156825;7082 emission lines. Allen (1980) showed that these Raman O VI lines are present in 50% of the SySt. Recently, Akras et al. (2019b) calculated this fraction as 55%, by using a large sample with all the known SySt in 2018. Moreover, it was shown that Raman O VI lines are an unique characteristic of the SySt.", "Symbiotic stars exhibit a wide variety of spectral features, see Munari & Zwitter (2002) for a comprehensive spectral atlas of symbiotic stars.

These diagnostic tools are good criteria to di\u000berentiate PNe from SySt. I lkiewicz & Miko lajewska (2017) also proposed a number of new diagnostic diagrams in the optical regime for discriminating SySt from PNe. One of these diagnostic diagrams is based on the He I recombinations as it can be seen in Fig. 1.10. The latter diagram allows to correctly identify SySt that have been misclassi\fed using the standard [O III] diagnostic diagram (I lkiewicz & Miko lajewska, 2017). Corradi et al. (2003) have shown, by purely statistical arguments, that it is highly improbable that a true PN central star would have a binary Mira companion.

They are recognized as manifestations of out ow activities from new- born stars (Reipurth & Bally, 2001). HH objects can usually be di\u000berentiated from PN due to their distinctive morphology, the presence of shocked-excited spectral features such as strong [S II], [N I] and [O I] emission lines (Canto, 1981; Cappellaro et al., 1994) and the proximity to star-forming regions and associated molecular clouds with high levels of surrounding extinction. Given the combination of low- excitation and high-density, the blue [S II] \u0015\u00154068,4076 lines are frequently strong relative to the H \fline in HH objects, if the impact of the reddening is not important. Related with HH objects are the young-stellar objects (YSOs). The spectra of these objects have emission lines such as Balmer lines (Witham et al., 2008), which emerges from the accretion disk. In their spectra it is clearly perceptible their reddened nature like in the SySt spectra. The strong reddening is an indicative of the cool e\u000bective temperature of these sources.

They are binary systems of very short orbital period, in which a white dwarf is accreting material from a close, Roche lobe-\flling companion, usually a main sequence G-, K- or M-type star (Patterson, 1984). Novae in the nebular phase show strong Balmer and [O III] emission lines and sometimes confused with PNe on objective prism plates. At later stages in the evolution of classical and recurrent novae, resolved shells become visible, comprised of ejected gaseous produced in the nova eruption. Nova shell shows both spherical and axisymmetric structures (e.g. Downes & Duerbeck, 2000), and they can have spectral signatures reminiscent of PNe.", "1.4.4 Wolf-Rayet stars", "Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars are evolved, massive and hot stars, with particularly strong winds, which caused the loss of their hydrogen envelopes, leaving their helium cores exposed. In particular, WR stars have wind densities one order of magnitude higher than the massive O stars (Crowther, 2007). The high mass-loss rates arise due to the very broad emission lines of helium, carbon, nitrogen and oxygen. The ejected material and the wind-blown bubbles surrounding Wolf-Rayets have occasionally been cataloged as PNe. This mis-classi\fcation is based on their spectral features, but in general the width of the emission-lines is enough to di\u000berentiate the WRs from PNe. There are two classes of WR stars: WN stars, which show broad emission lines of nitrogen and helium and WC stars with broad helium, carbon and oxygen lines. Fig. 1.11 shows the H \u000bimages of two WR (WR 16 and PCG 11), in which it is possible to see emission shells around these stars. Tools to discover planetary and symbiotic nebulae Chapter 1", "1.4.5 Be and B[e] stars", "Be stars are main-sequence and giant stars with strong Balmer lines. The prominent emission is produced in a circumstellar disk or an envelop, due to the rapid rotation or by the presence of magnetic \feld. B[e] stars are sub-giant stars which have additional emission lines of species such as Fe II, [Fe II], [O II] and [S II], and occasionally P-Cygni absorption pro\fles. B[e] stars are not homogeneous structures and many of them appear to have a surrounding nebula, produced by large-scale mass-loss events involving one or more eruptions (Marston & McCollum, 2006). The B[e] star He 2-90 have features very similar to those of PNe, and it is surrounded by a bipolar nebula (see \fgures 1.11 and 1.12). These objects are also very similar to the symbiotic systems and YSOs. Therefore they can be potential contaminants for SySt. Follow-up spectroscopic surveys of the IPHAS PN and SySt candidates have shown that the majority of their candidates are Be stars (Corradi et al., 2008).", "1.4.6 Galaxies", "In the past low-surface brightness (LSB) dwarf galaxies have also been mis-classi\fed as evolved PN by using morphological criteria alone. Occasionally, via resolved stel- lar population (deep imaging e. g. Hoessel et al., 1988) or spectroscopy (redshift) of emission objects the true identity as dwarf galaxy has been revealed. A few emission-line galaxies appeared in the early PN catalogues (e.g. Acker et al., 1991). Several galaxy sub-types have strong Balmer and forbidden emission-lines, and are potentially confused with PN on objective prism plates, where the lack of spectral resolution precluded an extragalactic identi\fcation for low redshift examples.

They were later spectro- scopic con\frmation by determinating their redshifts, for example, PHR J0950-5223 is one of these galaxies (Fig. 1.12).", "1.4.7 Supernova remnants", "Supernova remnants (SNR) are nebulae resulting from the explosion of massive stars. The one-sided \flamentary PNe, the Medusa nebula (Abell 21) and Sh 2-188 were identi\fed as SNR in the past. Several compact knots of extended SNRs have been classi\fed as PN candidates. For instance, Haro 2-12 which is a bright knot in Kepler's SNR of 1604 (Acker et al., 1987; Riesgo & L\u0013 opez, 2005) and PHR 0818-4728 (Parker et al., 2003), which turned out to be a compact knot in the Vela SNR. 1.4.8 Diagnostic diagrams: separating PNe and SySt from other emission line sources Here we discuss the optical diagnostic diagrams that were used in the past to select planetary nebulae and symbiotic stars. In general, diagnostic diagrams use several Chapter 1 Tools to discover planetary and symbiotic nebulae Figure 1.13: log (I(H\u000b)=I[N II]) versus log( I(H\u000b)=I[S II]) diagnostic diagram, which are used to separate PNe, H II regions and SNRs. Plot taken from Riesgo & L\u0013 opez (2006). emission-line intensities and are useful for di\u000berentiating resolved emission sources such as PN from H iiregions, SNRs and other objects. For example, Figure 1.13 shows a diagnostic diagram based on the H \u000b/[N II] and H \u000b/[S II] emission-line ratios (Sabbadin et al., 1977; Canto, 1981; Fesen et al., 1985; Riesgo & L\u0013 opez, 2006). The selection criteria were empirically derived in theses diagrams, by using emission lines ratios observed in supernova remnants, PNe and H II regions. Corradi et al. (2008) have used a method of selecting SySt candidates by com- binating IPHAS and IR (2MASS) colours, this methodology allows to di\u000berentiate symbiotic systems from both normal stars and H \u000bpoint sources emitters, includ- ing compact PN. Figure 1.14 displays the two IPHAS and 2MASS colour-colour diagrams used for in Corradi's work. With the combination of these diagnostic di- agrams it is possible to discriminate SySt and PNe from cataclysmic variables, B[e] and Mira stars in an e\u000bective way. Later, Viironen et al. (2009a,b) also used these two (IPHAS and 2MASS) colour-colour diagrams to discriminate PNe from stellar and other emission lines sources in the Galactic context. Figure 1.15 displays the two colour-colour diagrams, in which the PN locus is emphasized. In the IPHAS diagram, the ( r\u0000H\u000b) axis mainly indicates increasing values of the H \u000bemission line equivalent width, while the ( r\u0000i), for normal stars, represent a sequence of increasing spectral type and reddening. The 2MASS color-color diagram [( J\u0000H) vs (H\u0000Ks)] allows to explore the reddened nature of emission line objects. Tools to discover planetary and symbiotic nebulae Chapter 1 Figure 1.14: Diagnostic colour-colour diagrams for symbiotic stars and other objects based in IPHAS ( left plot ) and 2MASS ( right plot ) catalogues. The H \u000bemitters are given in distinct regions of the diagrams. The locus of main-sequence and RGB stars is indicated by the solid and dotted lines, respectively. Two sequences are shown, corresponding to the reddening values E(B-V)=0 and E(B-V)=4. The arrow indicates the length of the reddening vectors, which corresponds to AV= 3 mag.

(2019a) Recently, Akras et al. (2019a) used the photometric data from the 2MASS and WISE surveys to construct various diagnostic diagrams that show the distribution of SySt and other H \u000b-mimics in the near-mid infrared space. Fig. 1.16 shows the (W3 - W4) versus (Ks - W3) and (J - H) versus (W1 - W4) colour-colour diagnostic diagrams. Akras, Guzman-Ramirez, & Gon\u0018 calves (2019c) using the classi\fcation tree model (Grubinger et al., 2011) found new colour criteria to identify compact PNe of the best possible way by using both 2MASS and AllWISE photometric data. By combining these two catalogues, they found that W1-W4 \u00157.87 and J-H <1.10; H-W2\u00152.24 and J-H <0.50; and Ks-W3\u00156.42 and J-H <1.31 are optimal criteria to discover new PNe.", "1.5 Thesis overview", "The thesis is organized as follows. In Chapter 2, I present a description of the Javalambre Photometric Local Universe Survey (J-PLUS), the Southern-Photometric Local Universe Survey (S-PLUS) and the Javalambre Physics of the Accelerating Universe Astrophysical Survey (J-PAS). These new multi-band surveys, which con- tain both narrow- and broad-bands \flters, provide a unique opportunity to \fnd PNe and SySt in the Galactic halo. In Chapter 3, I discuss the new colour crite- ria based on these three surveys. I also present the machine learning techniques, more precisely principal component analysis (PCA) and linear discriminant analy- sis (LDA), which were used to discriminate objects classes. Chapter 4 discusses the validating strategy to the J-PLUS and J-PLUS colour-colour diagnostic diagrams. It also presents the \frst results on applying the colour criteria to the \frst J-PLUS Tools to discover planetary and symbiotic nebulae Chapter 1 data release (DR1) and S-PLUS DR1. The objects recovered in the DR1s were used to validate the machine learning methodologies.

This thesis makes use of the data from the J-PLUS Science Veri\fca- tion, \frst J-PLUS Data Release and \frst S-PLUS Data Release. The Javalambre Physics of the Accelerating Universe Astrophysical Survey (J-PAS, Ben\u0013 \u0010tez et al., 2015; http://www.j-pas.org/ ) is a multi-band survey that will also observe high latitudes of the Northern sky. The J-PLUS \flter set allows to relieve accurate spec- tral energy distributions (SEDs) for millions of calibration stars that will be used to transport the photometric calibration from J-PLUS to J-PAS (Gruel et al., 2012). The main purpose of J-PLUS was thus to calibrate the J-PAS project. Given that these surveys are de\fned by a set of narrow- and broad-band \flters able to cover the whole optical spectra, they provide an unique opportunity to search for PNe and SySt in the Galactic halo. J-PLUS and S-PLUS have a \flter designed to detect the H \u000brecombination line. In the case of J-PAS other emission line such as [O III], will be also detected by a speci\fc \flter, altogether J-PAS \flter system allows much better ways to isolate PNe and SySt. In the following chapter I discuss some of the previous photometric surveys that resulted in the detection of PNe. Then, I introduce the new J-PLUS, S-PLUS and forthcoming J-PAS surveys.", "2.1 Previous PNe and SySt surveys", "Several surveys have been used to \fnd new PNe in our Galaxy, since an accurate census of them is needed for a reliable calculation of the numbers, scale height, space density and birth rate of PNe in the Milky Way. Surveys previous than those discussed bellow have resulted in an extensive sample, out to a radius of \u00182.0 kpc from the Sun (Frew, 2008).

The MASH catalog includes several PNe of very large angular diameter. Once the SHS H \u000bdata became available it was possible to verify and con\frm the previous visual identi\fcation of the sources as well as to obtain more accurate estimates about of nebular size, morphology and position. By using the MASH catalog many of the PNe mimics such as H iiregions have been removed and during this process a signi\fcant number of new PNe were identi\fed. Overall, it contains around 60% more PNe than all the previous catalogs.", "2.1.2 SHASSA", "Given that the AAO/UKST H \u000bSurvey was restricted to an area in the range from 10 to 12\u000eof the Galactic plane, it is obvious that additional searches were necessary. Therefore, the AAO/UKST Survey was performed in the Southern Sky H-Alpha Survey Atlas (SHASSA; Gaustad et al., 2001), up to a Galactic latitude ofjbj= 10\u000e, with the principal goal of discovering new evolved PNe in the Solar neighborhood. SHASSA is a robotic wide-angle digital imaging survey aimed of detecting H \u000bemission from the warm ionized interstellar medium. It is formed by a narrow-band \flter (H \u000b+ [N II]) and continuum images of a large proportion of the Southern sky (17,000 deg2). SHASSA consists of 2168 images covering 542 \felds south of +16\u000edeclination. There are four kind of images available for each \feld: H\u000b, red continuum, continuum-corrected H \u000b1and a smoothed H \u000bimage. Images 1These are generated by subtracting each continuum image from the corresponding H \u000bimage. Chapter 2 Tools to discover planetary and symbiotic nebulae of individual \felds in the surveys may be accessed on the Web http://amundsen. swarthmore.edu/SHASSA/ orhttp://www.lco.org/SHASSA/ . A visual inspection of the SHASSA images resulted in a discovery of 17 nebulae (PNe) with a radius larger than 5 arcmin. All previously known PNe larger than this size were recovered in SHASSA's blind search. Good example are Hewett 1 A complementary survey to SHASSA, the Virginia Tech Spectral line Survey (VTSS; Dennison, Simonetti, & Topasna, 1998) covers a wide strip around the Northern Galactic plane,jbj\u001430\u000e. Like SHASSA, the combination of fast optics, narrow- band \flters and a CCD detector provides a high sensitivity to di\u000buse H \u000bemission. VTSS used the Spectral Line Imaging Camera (SLIC) of the Celestron-5 telescope, which obtains circular images with a diameter of 10\u000e, with a resolution of 96 arcsec per pixel. This survey is formed by a narrow-band H \u000b\flter with FWHM2= 17.5 \u0017A and continuum \flters as well as a [S II] \flter centered in 6725 \u0017A. Each VTSS \feld was planned to have four images: H \u000b, continuum-corrected H \u000b, [S II] and continuum-corrected [S II].", "Due to the low spatial resolution of the survey, only three nebulae (PNe) were identi\fed (Frew et al., 2006).", "2.1.4 IPHAS", "The Isaac Newton Telescope (INT) Photometric H \u000bSurvey of the Northern Galactic Plane (IPHAS; Drew et al. 2005) is a direct consequence of the success of the SHS.

On the other hand, the (r0\u0000H\u000b) vs (r0\u0000i0) colour-colour diagram, turned out to be very useful to separate objects with an excess in H \u000bemission, from stellar objects. Thus, in Figure 2.1, sources with an H \u000bexcess appear at the top of the diagram, while the most reddened objects are placed to the right (Drew et al. 2005). Gonz\u0013 alez-Solares et al.

Photometry in simple circular apertures of di\u000berent sizes (300and 600). (ii) Isophotal photometry ( SExtractor's MAG ISO). (iii) Kron photometry ( SExtractor's MAG AUTO . (iv) Petrosian photometry ( SExtractor's MAG PETRO ). (v) Photometry after degrading the images of all the bands to the worst PSF. ( vi) Pho- tometry after convolving all the images with a Gaussian kernel of \u001b=1.500. (vii) And photometry applying a PSF correction as that applied in (Molino et al., 2014). In the present work we use the 600aperture. This choice follows the automatic method used by IPHAS photometry to \fnd compact PNe, with small angular diameter (typ- ically\u0014500, Viironen et al., 2009b). A similar 600-aperture was also considered by Akras, Guzman-Ramirez, & Gon\u0018 calves (2019c), who found that PNe with angular sizes larger than 600exhibit very low ( r\u0000H\u000b) color indexes. S-PLUS is the Southern counterpart of the J-PLUS project. Therefore, this survey shares very similar characteristics with J-PLUS. S-PLUS is carried out with the T80-South (T80S). This is a new telescope optimized for robotic operations; it is equipped with a wide FoV camera ( \u00182 deg2). This camera is identical to the camera of the T80/JAST installed at the Observatorio Astrof\u0013 \u0010sico de Javalambre. Up to the end of the project, T80S will observe a total area of around 9,000 deg2of the southern hemisphere.", "Chapter 2 Tools to discover planetary and symbiotic nebulae Figure 2.5: T80S is located on Cerro Tololo besides the PROMPT telescopes.

This \flter set is very similar to the J-PLUS, though with some di\u000berences in its con\fguration. Table 2.2 summarizes the main characteristic of the 12 S-PLUS \flters. As in J- PLUS, the u-band is designated to detect the blue emission of the sources, the intermediate-band \flters ( J0395,J0410,J0430,J0515 andJ0861) are used to detect absorption features, the two broad-band \flters ( J0378 andJ0660) are designated to isolate two emissions lines ([O II] and H \u000b) and \fnally the broad-band \flters are for the continuum. Figure 2.6 displays the S-PLUS transmission curves. They are similar to those from J-PLUS \flters (see Figure 2.3), with a slight di\u000berence in throughput and the width of the \flters. Therefore, both surveys can be used to carry out a systematic search for PNe and SySt, by applying the same methodology. First Data Release (DR1) The S-PLUS DR1 includes 80 \felds of the Stripe-82 area, a rectangular area with coordinates 4h<RA<20hand -1.26\u000e<Dec<1.26\u000e. These \felds were observed during the scienti\fc validation process of the survey. DR1 contains about one million sources and the limiting magnitude of each \flter is presented in Table 2.2.

And the di\u000berence of the FWHM of the four \flters was never more than half a pixel. S-PLUS DR1 was also used to estimate the aver- age photometric depth of the S-PLUS images (Mendes de Oliveira et al., 2019). S-PLUS Stripe-82 data served to characterize the performance of the photo-z es- timates for di\u000berent magnitudes and redshift range. The detection of the sources was made using SExtractor . Photometry was performed within 3 types of aper- tures. i) Circular apertures of 300of diameter ( SExtractor's APER ). ii) Kron photometry ( SExtractor's AUTO . iii) And petrosian photometry ( SExtrac- tor's PETRO ). Di\u000berently of the case with J-PLUS , here we used the circular aperture of 300. This is so because 300is the available aperture in S-PLUS. In ad- dition to the arguments given in Section 2.2.1, this aperture is the best within the three possibilities, since it assures that large objects with high surface brightness like emission line galaxies or H iiregions will not be recovered with the automated methods.", "The Javalambre-Physics of the Accelerating Universe Astrophysical Survey (J-PAS; http://www.j-pas.org ) original conception is outlined in Ben\u0013 \u0010tez et al.

It will be operational for 5 years and it will observe 8,500 deg2of Northern sky to a 5-Sigma magnitude depth for point sources, equivalent to i\u001823:3 over an aperture of 2 arcsec2.", "The J-PAS \flter systems consists of 54 contiguous narrow-band \flters of 145 \u0017A FWHM. The \flter set spans the optical range from \u00183700 to 9200 \u0017A, plus 1 medium-band \flter that covers the UV edge and 1 broad-band \flter redwards 9100 \u0017A. In addition, the survey also include three regular broad-band \flters, u;gandr. The \frst of these \flters has a redder cuto\u000b than SDSS uband. The other two \flters are similar to those used in the SDSS. After the end of the J-PAS survey, the redshift and SEDS for\u0018200 million galaxies, with an accuracy of \u0001 z=(1 +z)\u00140:3% will be determined (Cenarro et al., 2017). J-PAS uses 5 deg2low-resolution integral \feld unit (IFU) which will produce a 3D image of the Galactic halo and the extragalactic Northern sky. J-PAS will provide a low-resolution spectrum for every pixel of the sky and it will allow to carry out science in di\u000berent \felds of the Astrophysics. The galaxy evolution and star forming rate at di\u000berent redshift can be studied as well as two dimensional star population, SNRs, gamma rays, very low mass objects, etc. Halo PNe and SySt can be detectable by J-PAS, because of their spectral features with strong emission lines. Figure 2.7 shows the J-PAS transmission curve over- lapping a known PN. Important low- and high-ionization emission lines such as H \u000b, [S III]\u00159069, [O II] \u00153727, among others fall into the narrow-band \flters. At the moment, there are no data published by the survey. Tools to discover planetary and symbiotic nebulae Chapter 2 Transmission Figure 2.7: The J-PAS transmission curves. The \flters are spaced around 100 \u0017A but have FWHM of 145 \u0017A, what produces an overlap among them.

Chapter 3 Photometric techniques The radiation emitted by a star can be measured integrating it for all the wave- lengths. This total energy emitted by a star is called bolometric brightness or magnitude (Strai\u0014 zys, 1992). It follows from the Stefan-Boltzmann law in which the luminosity, L, of a star, its radius, R, and e\u000bective temperature, Te\u000b, in solar units, are related by the equation logL L\f= 2 logR R\f+ 4 logTe\u000b The luminosity of a star, in solar units, can be expressed in absolute bolometric magnitudes Mbol=\u00002:5 logL", "3.1 Stellar photometry", "The following de\fnitions follow Strai\u0014 zys (1992). All stars, except the Sun, are considered as point sources because of their large distance from us. Considering a star at a distance rfrom the telescope, which has an area dsperpendicular to the line of sight, the total energy received/collected by the telescope, neglecting the losses due to the interstellar medium and the atmosphere, is given by the formula: whereI(\u0015) is the speci\fc intensity of the radiation that is emitted from the star, d! is the solid angle under which the area dsis seen from the star ( d!=r\u00002ds),dtis the interval of time and \u0015is the wavelength. Equation 3.3 represents the de\fnition of intensity.", "The amount of energy dropping on the area dsper unity interval of time is called the radiation ux Tools to discover planetary and symbiotic nebulae Chapter 3 The radiation ux per unit surface and per time is called illuminance, ds=dE(\u0015) dtds=I(\u0015) Sinceris constant for a given star, the illuminance per unit of interval of wavelength can be considered as a measure of the speci\fc intensity which is called the energy distribution of the spectrum (see Strai\u0014 zys, 1992). Instead of unity wavelength the Eq. 3.5 can also be expressed in unit frequency by considering In practice, the illuminance is called brightness and is measured in stellar magni- tudes.

If all stars were at the same distance the ratio of their magnitudes would correspond to the ratio of their intrinsic magnitudes. If considering one of the stars with magnitude m2, as the known object, and the other star with magnitude m1, as the unknown source, the relation of the magnitudes between the two stars can be obtained from Eq. 3.8 takingm1=mandm2=m0:", "whereH0is a calibration parameter and His the brightness. So far, we have worked with the de\fnition of illuminance, brightness and magni- tudes without any speci\fc interval of wavelengths. In reality the brightness of a star can be related with the integrated energy radiated in all wavelength range or with a certain interval of wavelength. The \frst case is the bolometric brightness (see the Chapter 3 Tools to discover planetary and symbiotic nebulae bolometric magnitude expressed in Eq. 3.2). The second case is the magnitude of a star in a speci\fc wavelength range.", "We now can obtain the monochromatic magnitude from the illuminance, per units of wavelength. This means by using the equations 3.5 and 3.9, mmon=\u00002:5 logI(\u0015) r2 whereI(\u0015) is the speci\fc intensity (de\fned from Equations 3.4 and 3.5) of the star at a wavelength \u0015and the term\\const\" denotes the zero point of a magnitude scale.

The most widely known, in the optical regime, are ( i) the BVRI of Johnson-Morgan systems (Bessell, 2005) and ( ii) the uvby or Str omgren photometric system (Crawford, 1958). Because the observations are obtained from di\u000berent telescopes and slightly di\u000berent \flters, in order to be consistent they have to be corrected for the di\u000berences. The response functionSof the \flter system, the telescope and the detector do exactly that. If the response function of the system is S(\u0015), the observed magnitudes are called heterochromatic and they are de\fned as mhetero =\u00002:5 logR usuallyS(\u0015) function is described by whereTt(\u0015) is the product of the throughout of the telescope, the instrument and the quantum e\u000eciency of the detector, Tf(\u0015) is the \flter transmission and Ta(\u0015) is the atmospheric transmission.", "Assumingm1andm2as the monochromatic magnitudes of a star at \u00151and\u00152, respectively, Eq. 3.8 gives herem1\u0000m2is known as color index.

In the telescope the magnitude measured is the instrumental magnitude that is described according to the number of counts scored by the detector, such as: wheren\u0015is the rate of detected photons. The synthetic and instrumental magnitude are related by the instrumental zero point (zp) , in the following way, msynt=ninst+zp (3.17) where zpmakes possible to obtain the magnitude for any system from the instru- mental magnitude measured with the telescope.", "Considering now that the radiation ( I0(\u0015)) emitted from a star passes through a absorbing medium with optical thickness x, the \fnal intensity of the radiation will be reduced and be given by the following formula where\u0014\u0015is the extinction coe\u000ecient at the wavelength \u0015.

By measuring the monochromatic brightness of a star in two spectral bands, and considering no interstellar extinction, the intrinsic color index is given by m1\u0000m2. If the radiation of a star passes through an interstellar cloud of unit optical thickness (x= 1), then, magnitudes m1andm2convert into m1+e1andm2+e2, wheree1 ande2are the extinctions when x= 1. The color index of the star will then be here (e1\u0000e2) is an additional reddening given by the absorbing interstellar cloud and it is called color excess:", "The color excess caused by xunits of absorbing matter is Chapter 3 Tools to discover planetary and symbiotic nebulae The valuexe(extinction) is usually denoted by A. It is produced by scattering and absorption of light by interstellar dust.", "Ifm1\u0000m2is the color index of a star and Em1\u0000m2its color excess, then the intrinsic color will be Eventually, the extinction in the magnitude m1can be written as a function of the magnitude m2,A1=kA2. In this case Eq. 3.23 turn in if we denote ( k\u00001)\u00001byR, then coe\u000ecientRis the ratio of extinction to color excess and it is one of the most important parameters of a two colors photometric system. By replacing m1andm2 byBandVbands, we obtain the well known color excess: Photometric systems with more than two colors can generate an important pa- rameter, the color excess ratio. Considering three bands in a photometric system m1,m2andm3which correspond to three wavelengths, a colour-colour diagram can be construct based on these bands, m1\u0000m2versusm2\u0000m3. In this diagram the unreddened stars form a de\fnite sequence. When there is interstellar reddening each star in the diagram moves along the reddening line with the slope This ratio depends on the properties of the interstellar medium. Now, with the \u001fratio and the two color indices de\fned it is also possible to de\fne theQ-parameter as TheQ-parameter is independent of the interstellar reddening. In fact, the Q- parameter is the ordinate of the point at which the reddening line of a star intersects the axism1\u0000m2= 0.", "Tools to discover planetary and symbiotic nebulae Chapter 3", "3.2 System of magnitudes", "Any photometric system is de\fned by a set of narrow-, intermediate- or broad-band \flters.

The resolution of the J-PLUS and S-PLUS photometry allows to perceive undoubtedly the reddened nature of the SySt, as well as a number of extragalactic SySt: NGC 205 (Gon\u0018 calves et al., 2015), IC 10 (Gon\u0018 calves et al., 2008) and NGC 185 (Gon\u0018 calves et al., 2012)", "3.5.2 Other emission line objects", "The synthetic photometry for a number of emission lines sources that could be mistaken by PNe or SySt in the J-PLUS and S-PLUS surveys are now concerned. For instance, extragalactic H iiregions located in the dwarf galaxy NGC 55 (Magrini et al., 2017). The \frst panels of Figure 3.4 shows the photo-spectrum ( left) and observed spectrum ( right ) of one of these extragalactic H iiregions, in which the H\u000bemission is also perceptible. Note that the [O III] and H \fhave a small impact on theg-band. A comparison between the synthetic and observed spectra of PNe and H iiregions shows that these two types of sources display very similar spectral features with emission lines such as H \u000band [O III] lines, which will make hard to distinguish them within the J-PLUS and S-PLUS catalogues. The spectra of a group of young stellar objects from Lupus and Sigma Orionis (Rigliaco et al., 2012; Alcal\u0013 a et al., 2014) are also considered. The second panels of Figure 3.4 presents the results for a YSO (RU Lup from Lupus, Alcal\u0013 a et al., 2014). An accretion disk, from where the H \u000bemission emerges, is also present in this type of (pre-main-sequence) stars. YSO's photometry shows a continuum stronger in the red part of the spectrum, which closely resembles that of the SySt (see Figure 3.3). A CV from the SDSS catalogue is shown in the third panels . CVs are interacting binary systems, in which a white dwarf accretes gas from a main-sequence star, via Roche lobe out ow and an accretion disk is formed during this process. The emission-lines are produced in the accretion disk of the binary system (Williams, 1980). Therefore, the presence of the H \u000bemission in their photo- spectrum is indicating the nebular nature of the CVs. It is straightforward to notice that based on their photo-spectra, PNe of high- and low-excitation could be wrongly classi\fed as CVs. The forth panels display a B[e] star (Lamers et al., 1998). B[e] stars have a surrounding nebula produced by large-scale mass-loss involving one or more eruptions (Marston & McCollum, 2006). Its photo-spectrum resembles that of both SySt and YSOs.", "Figure 3.5 shows a set of J/S-PLUS synthetic spectra of extragalactic objects with emission lines.

Finally, note that star-forming galaxies have photo-spectra very di\u000berent from those presented in Figures 3.1 and 3.3 and then they will be easily distinguished from PNe and SySt. 3.6 Synthetic colour-colour diagrams: selection criteria The photo-spectra of the emission-line sources discussed in Section 3.5 were used to build diagnostic colour-colour diagrams. Our goal is to pinpoint the most relevant ones to discriminate PNe and SySt from all the aforementioned mimics.", "3.6.1 IPHAS equivalent colour-colour diagram", "Drew et al. (2005) designed the IPHAS survey (see Chapter 1) showing that the ( r0\u0000 H\u000b) vs (r0\u0000i) diagram, where H \u000bis the name of the narrow-band \flter designated to detect the H \u000bemission line, is an optimal tool to select strong H \u000bemission-line sources (Witham et al., 2008). IPHAS PNe and SySt candidates were selected by using the IPHAS colour-colour diagram as well as the common ( J\u0000H) vs (H\u0000 Ks) 2MASS diagram. Their true nature was con\frmed later on, spectroscopically (Corradi et al., 2008; Viironen et al., 2009a; Rodr\u0013 \u0010guez-Flores et al., 2014; Sabin Given that the J-PLUS and S-PLUS \flter systems include the three IPHAS \flters, we reconstructed the IPHAS equivalent diagram (Figure 3.6). The colour (r\u0000J0660) clearly indicates an increasing excess of the H \u000bemission-line, while the (r\u0000i) increases with the reddening, as previously stated by Corradi et al. (2008). Both modelled PNe and observed SySt are found to display ( r\u0000J0660)>0:6 due to their strong H \u000bemission lines, with the former occupying the left part ( r\u0000i)<0 and the latter the right ( r\u0000i)>0 part of the diagnostic diagram. However, note that some SySt (three) have values of ( r\u0000J0660)<0:6. The solid (black) and the dashed (red) lines in Figure 3.6 represent the selection criteria for PNe (PNe zone) and SySt (SySt zone), respectively.

The de\fnition of the selection criteria or zones has been made by visual inspection of each diagnostic diagram separately. This may indicate that our list of PNe and SySt candidates will end up not characterized by high purity. The PNe zone is contaminated by extragalactic H iiregions, especially for moderately low (r\u0000J0660) colour index or, equivalently, low-excitation nebulae. Nevertheless, the observed PNe are well located in the PNe zone with high ( r\u0000J0660)>1. On the other hand, the SySt zone is also contaminated by extragalactic H iiregions, in addition of YSOs. Recall that SySt and YSOs have very similar photo-spectra, both being brighter in the red part of the optical spectrum. IPHAS also faced the same kind of problem being highly contaminated from other types of H \u000bemitter, as it was demonstrated from the results of spectroscopic follow-up (e.g. SySt: Rodr\u0013 \u0010guez- Flores et al., 2014, PNe: Viironen et al., 2009a,b). The distribution of main sequence (MS) and giant stars (purple and brown symbols in the inset \fgures) in the ( r-J0660) vs (r-i) diagnostic diagram is such that both groups of stars occupy regions with lower (r-J0660) index ( <1.2) and higher ( r-i) index (>0) than the PNe zone (Drew et al., 2005; Corradi et al., 2008). White dwarf (WD) stars (light green symbols in insert \fgures) also present low ( r-J0660) index ( >0), however they exhibit ( r-i) colour>\u00001. Hence, there is no mixture between PNe and the bulk of MS, giant and WD stars. The arrow indicates the reddening vector with A V'2 mag. It was estimated by comparing the locus of unreddened models of PNe with the reddened ones.", "3.6.2 New colour-colour diagrams", "The multi-band \flter systems of J-PLUS and S-PLUS (12 narrow- and broad-band \flters) allow us to compute several di\u000berent colour indices for each source and thus construct new colour-colour diagnostic diagrams. In order to search for PN and SySt candidates in the J-PLUS and S-PLUS catalogues, in the most e\u000bective way, four new colour-colour diagrams are de\fned in Figures 3.7 and 3.8 ( J0515\u0000J0660) J0660) vs. (g\u0000i) ). The PNe and SySt zones are also de\fned in these new diagnostic diagrams.", "Generally, PNe are well separated from all the other H \u000bsources used in this work, except extragalactic H iiregions, as it is well known (Parker et al., 2006). High- and low-excitation PNe occupy distinct regions within the PNe zone. For instance H 4-1, a moderate high-ionization PN exhibits ( g\u0000J0515)\u0019\u00002 (lower panel of Figure 3.7), with T e\u000baround 132\u0002103K ((Henry et al., 1996)), while MWC 574, a very low-excitation PN with ( g\u0000J0515)\u00190:0, exhibits an [O III] even weaker than H\femission (Sanduleak & Stephenson, 1972; Pereira & Miranda, 2007). In the case of the SySt zone in the two plots of Figure 3.7 is contaminated by H iiregions and YSOs, but not in the two diagrams of Figure 3.8. Apparently, the detection of SySt candidates in all the four diagnostic diagrams is an indispensable condition which increases the possibility of \fnding genuine SySt. The ( J0515\u0000J0861) colour index Chapter 3 Tools to discover planetary and symbiotic nebulae is associated with the continuum of the sources. Neither of these two \flters contains any strong emission line. The ( J0515\u0000J0660) colour provides an estimation of the H\u000bexcess.", "Regarding the second diagnostic diagram of Figure 3.7 (lower panel), the ( g\u0000 J0515) colour index yields the excess of the [O III] lines. Therefore, the higher the (g\u0000J0515) colour is, the higher the excitation of the nebula. This can be seen from the photo-spectra of two cloudy models with di\u000berent stellar temperatures (see Figure 3.2). Recall, however, that the gbroad-band \flter is also a\u000bected by the H \f and other emission-lines down to about 4,000 \u0017A. The (z\u0000J0660) colour (upper panel of Figure 3.8) index also gives us an es- timation of the H \u000bexcess, by taking into account the continuum at the very red part of the spectrum, while the ( z\u0000g) colour is directly related to the shape of the continuum from the blue to the red part of the spectrum. QSOs and SFGs are concentrated in a very small area [ \u00002<(z\u0000J0660)<1 and\u00002<(z\u0000g)<1] well separated from PNe. The SySt, on the other hand, have a small overlap with QSOs and SFGs but they are found to be bluer in the ( z\u0000g) colour index as well as the dusty YSOs.", "Finally, (g\u0000i) is another colour index associated with the shape of the continuum and the (J0410\u0000J0660) colour with the H \u000bexcess, by using di\u000berent parts of the spectrum in contrast with the previous diagrams. From lower panel in Figure 3.8, we \fnd that QSOs and SFGs show an increase in the ( J0410\u0000J0660) colour as a function of the ( g\u0000i) colour, while PNe appear to have a more restricted range of (g\u0000i) values between -2 and 0, and ( J0410\u0000J0660) values from 0 to 4. Hence, the (J0410\u0000J0660) vs (g\u0000i) colour-colour diagram can distinguish PNe from galaxies. Regarding SySt, most of them have ( J0410\u0000J0660)>2 occupying a distinct region in this colour-colour diagram. Both SySt and YSO are found to lie in the right part of the plot [( g\u0000i)>2], which is indicative of the presence of a cool companion or a dusty envelope. This last diagnostic diagram turns out to be very useful to assure a low contamination by B[e] stars, di\u000berently from the \frst three diagrams. Figures 3.7 and 3.8 (inset diagrams) also illustrate the loci of main sequence, giant and white dwarf stars in the colour-colour diagrams, which clearly are not mixed with PNe. According to this analysis, we conclude that it is very hard to separate PNe from H iiregions in both J-PLUS and S-PLUS projects. However, all the colour-colour diagrams turned out to be very useful to identify good PN and SySt candidates. The combination of several narrow- and broad-band \flters to construct colour-colour diagrams allows to characterize the whole optical spectrum of each source. Therefore, if a source satis\fes simultaneously all the criteria of either being a PN or SySt, the possibility of a false positive identi\fcation, though not negligible, is small making this candidate a good target for spectroscopic follow-up.

J-PAS synthetic photometry has been computed for all sources mentioned above using the theoretical transmission curves of the \flters and Eq. 3.38. J-PAS photo-spectra are shown in Figure 3.9. Given that J-PAS has better spec- tral resolution compared to J-PLUS and S-PLUS, it is possible to obtain aditional spectral information of the sources. It is clearly perceptible that emission lines like [O III] and [He II] can be detected in one of the narrow-band \flters of J-PAS (see also transmission curve of J-PAS Figure 2.7 of chapter 2), typical emission lines of PNe and SySt. For the case of QSOs, J-PAS photometry has been also calculated for those with redshifts in the range from 3 :03< z < 3:20.

For instance, LDA has been recently used to identify PNe and SySt from a list of H \u000bemission lines sources using 2MASS and WISE photometric data (Akras et al., 2019b; Akras et al., 2019c). This method projects a data set into a lower-variable space which maximize the separation between classes of data. LDA traces a linear combination of the variables such that the separation between classes of variance is maximized (Hastie et al., 2009). Therefore, LDA is a classi\fcation method in statistical and probabilistic learning (Ghojogh & Crowley, 2019). LDA is similar to PCA, since both perform linear combinations to transform a data set in a new one, where the latter is a projection of the old data set. The di\u000berence between the two statistical techniques is that LDA aims to \fnd the projection of maximum separability, while PCA \fnds the projection that maximizes the variance of the data. Figure 3.15 is an illustration of how the new dimension is constructed favoring the separation between the class of dispersion. To achieve the \fnal goal of LDA, it is be necessary to perform three steps. The \frst step consists of determining the distance between the means of di\u000berent classes, i. e. the separability between di\u000berent classes of variance. This is called between-class variance or between-class matrix. The second step is to calculate the distance between the mean and the sample of each class, which is called within- class variance or within-class matrix. The third step includes the construction of a lower-dimensional space that maximize the between class-variance and minimizes the within class-variance (Tharwat et al., 2017). In the last step, the dimensions of the original data, for example, X, is reduced by projecting it onto the lower-dimensional space of LDA, Vk. Here the number the dimensions of new lower-dimensions is k. Therefore, each sample of Xis represented in thek-dimensional space by projecting it onto the lower-dimensional space ( Vk) as follows, Y=XVk whereYrepresent the projected sample in the new dimensions.

The upper panel presents the LD2 vs LD1 diagram. PNe and SySt are well separated from the other classes of objects (SySt zone are contaminated by YSOs), showing that the strong emission lines and the shape of the continuum (blue continuum for PNe and red continuum for SySt) are the features that most contribute in the maximization of the distance between the objects. PNe are found to occupy a region at the left part of the LD2 vs LD1 diagram with LD1 <0. Only a small number of modelled PNe are found to have LD1>0. The observed data of hPNe is consistent with this analysis. H iiregions, the most common mimic of PNe, are also found in the right part of the diagram with LD1 between 0 and 8. Despite PNe and H iiregions show di\u000berent LD1 values, they have similar LD2 ( upper panel ) and LD3 values ( lower panel ). PNe exhibit a very narrow range of LD2 and LD3 values compared to H iiregions, which will allow us to discard several H iiregions from our \fnal list of PNe candidates.

This catalogue contains \u00183,500, on which they are designated as true, likely and possible PNe. We found 4 matches with J-PLUS and one with S-PLUS. The J-PLUS ones Chapter 4 Tools to discover planetary and symbiotic nebulae appear in the colour-colour diagrams as purple (1 true PN), brown (1 likely PN) and orange (2 possible PNe) circles, while the S-PLUS match is the dark magenta (1 possible PN) circle in Figures 4.2 and 4.3. It is straightforward noticing from these diagnostic diagrams that none of these sources were classi\fed as PNe by our criteria, being all located outside the PN zone. Below we describe each source individually. J-PLUS is classi\fed as a true PN in the HASH catalog (tHASH PN). This object was previously reported as a PN by Jacoby & van de Steene (1995). The low (r\u0000J0660) and ( J0515\u0000J0660) colour indices are indicative of very weak, or totally absent, H \u000bline-emission. For this reason, Jacoby 1 was not recovered from our criteria. Figures 4.2 and 4.3 display the position of this PN in our diagnostic diagrams (purple circle) and it can easily be seen that it lies in an area below the PNe zone. The top-left panel of Figure 4.7 displays the photo- spectrum and corresponding image of Jacoby 1. This photo-spectrum is typical for white dwarfs (e.g. Figure 14 of Cenarro et al., 2019 ).

Thus, on the second step, SMOTE resampling method is carried out on the PC dataset. SMOTE was implemented in Python using the imblearn library. To quantify the classi\fcation of each source, its probability to belong to each class was derived using the logistic regression model. Logistic regression (Pregibon, 1982) is a kind of regression analysis or sta- tistical method used for predicting binary classes. It is an extension of the linear regression model for classi\fcation problems. It uses a logistic function to model a binary dependent variable, although many more complex extensions exist. Mathe- matically, a binary logistic model has a dependent variable with two possible values, pass/fail, which is represented by an indicator variable, with values \\0\" and \\1\" Let us, assume that \\x\" is the input feature and \\y\" the output, which can be either \\0\" or \\1\". The probability that the output is \\1\" given the input feature \\x\" can be represented as: P(y= 1jx). In case of linear regression, the probability p(X) is de\fned as \f0+\f1Xand the probability can take either positive or negative values.

This is because none of the \fve colour-colour diagrams that comprise our selection criteria actually completely isolates these two types of sources. Moreover, our selection criteria were, on the one hand, very successful by avoiding all the other strong emission-line emitters present in the \felds, which means that J-PLUS and S-PLUS can really do a good job in terms of searching for PNe and at the same time minimizing the list of spectroscopic follow-up candidates.

Their total number depends, therefore, on the stellar population of the galaxy itself. For example, Buzzoni et al. (2006) showed that the reddest elliptical galaxies are poorer in PNe (per unit galaxy luminosity) than spiral galaxies. The PNe luminosity function (PNLF) is universal (Ciardullo et al., 2002) and well described by a double exponential, with an absolute magnitude cut- o\u000b M\u0003=-4.47 (Ciardullo et al., 1989)1. This translates to an apparent magnitude of m 5007= 10.55 at the distance of 10 kpc, which we use as reference radius to integrate the PNLF as well as to an apparent magnitude of m 5007= 13.5 at the distance of 40 kpc, which is the radius of the inner halo of the Milky Way (MW; Bland-Hawthorn & Gerhard, 2016).", "In order to estimate the number of PNe that we expect to \fnd in the MW halo using the J-PLUS and S-PLUS projects we need to calculate: ( i) the number of PNe we expect to \fnd given the survey magnitude limit; ( ii) the number of PNe that might get lost due to the contamination/crowding from other objects; and, \fnally, ( iii) the number of PNe that we expect to \fnd given the underlying stellar population of the MW halo.", "We thus run a set of simulations, by populating images with the typical J- PLUS and S-PLUS image noise with simulated PNe that mimic the properties of 3 known hPNe (H 4-1, PNG135.9+55.9 and DdDm 1). In order to investigate the completeness limit, we vary the brightness of the simulated PNe from their real brightness to 5 magnitudes fainter, keeping their radii \fxed. The known hPNe, for which spectra (Howard et al., 1997; Kwitter & Henry, 1998) are available for us are listed in Table 5.1, together with their fundamental properties. H 4-1 and PNG135.9+55.9 were observed with JAST/T80 (Cenarro et al., 2014) and their radii were obtained by \ftting a MOFFAT gaussian function in the g-band images. The radius of DdDm 1 comes from the literature (Howard et al., 1997). We transformed the MOFFAT radius from arcsecs into pixels, by adopting the standard J-PLUS pixel scale (nearly 0.500/pix). We reach 99% completeness till m 5007= 21.8 for DdDm 1 and PNG 135.9+55.9; see Figure 5.1 for examples of the variation of the recovered number of PNe with magnitude (see also Cortesi et al., 2013). For H 4-1, the limiting magnitude to recover 99% of the objects is m 5007= 21.2. We also performed the same test on real J-PLUS images, in order to check how many objects we might loose due to crowding, for instance. We found that we can detect 98% of the objects down to a magnitude of m g;lim= 21.2, which translates into m 5007;lim= mg;lim- 0.75 = 20.45 (Arnaboldi et al., 2002).

(2002) show that the absolute magnitude of the PNLF cuto\u000b is fainter in small and low-metallicity systems, but the trend is well modelled by the theoretical relation of Dopita, Jacoby, & Vassiliadis (1992) Tools to discover planetary and symbiotic nebulae Chapter 5 Figure 5.1: Recovered number of point like sources as a function of magnitude for ( top) DdDm 1, ( medium ) H 4-1 and PNG 135.9+55.9 ( bottom ).

This e\u000bect might vary depending on the galactic coordinates, since the number of expected hPNe, as much as of halo stars, depends on the Galactic coordinates ( l,b). In fact, L\u0013 opez-Sanjuan et al. (2019) performed a morphological star/galaxy classi\fcation of the J-PLUS data and found that the number counts decreases with galactic latitude ( b) as we move away from the Galactic plane. Moreover, higher latitude tiles seem to present a double power- law shape. This can be interpreted as the dominance of halo stars in these \felds. Therefore, far away from the Galactic plane, where we expect to \fnd more hPNe, our quest would be made easier by the lower number of disk/bulge stars. We are now left with the not trivial question: how many PNe we expect to \fnd in the MW halo, or in general in the halo of a spiral galaxy? In fact, to calculate exactly the number of PNe in the MW halo we should know its composition and shape. Such a quest eludes from the scope of this thesis, and, on the contrary, the recovered catalog of MW-halo-PNe, resulting from this work, could be used at the purpose of de\fning the shape and properties of the MW halo. We performed a simple calculation, by integrating the PNLF from the value of M\u0003at 10 kpc, till the estimated completness limit m 5007;lim.", "N(m) =Zmlim where the parameter a(0) determines the number of PNe we expect to \fnd and varies according to the stellar population of the galaxy. In order to derive the number of PNe in a galaxy we introduced the \u000bparameter (Jacoby, 1980) that indicates the speci\fc frequency of PNe, i.e. the constant of proportionality between the PNe number and the stellar luminosity. The value of log \u000bvaries from log \u000b=\u00005:99 for Leo A to log \u000b=\u00007:13 for M33 (Buzzoni et al., 2006). Assuming that the halo of a galaxy is an extension of its bulge, and therefore that their stellar populations are similar, we could use the value for the bulge of M31, log \u000b=\u00006:94 as a proxy for the MW halo. Alternatively we could assume that the halo of the MW is formed by a metal poor population such as in the SMC, where log \u000b=\u00006:67. We recover the value of a(0) for the SMC and M31 bulge by integrating Eq. 5.1 within 8mag from the PNLF bright-end tail at 10 kpc, in order to achieve the PN population size inferred according to two di\u000berent extrapolation methods: 1) standard empirical PNLF from Jacoby (1989), corrected for metallicity (Dopita et al., 1992), for the Tools to discover planetary and symbiotic nebulae Chapter 5 \u000borigin log\u000b# Total # J-PLUS # S-PLUS #(J-PLUS DR1) Table 5.2: Expected number of hPNe per survey for two case. Case 1 and Case 2, equivalent to the M31 bulge and SMC metallicities, respectively. M31 bulge and 2) using the Jacoby (2006) observed SMC PNLF and correcting for metallicity as for the standard case, for the SMC (see Table 4 in Buzzoni et al. Table 5.2 summarizes the expected (total) number of PNe in the MW and the expected numbers to be detected by J-PLUS and S-PLUS at the completion of the surveys (8,500 deg2and 9,000 deg2) out of the 41,253 deg2of the celestial sphere, respectively, for di\u000berent \u000bvalues. We, therefore, estimate we shall observe between \u00005PNe in the halo of the MW in the J-PLUS DR1.", "Finally, the numbers provided in Table 5.2 are purely indicative: in fact, we are here assuming that the PNe are homogeneously distributed on the sky while they might be concentrated in regions that trace the accretion of dwarf satellites. It is in any case interesting seeing how, just by determining the number of PNe we will recover with J-PLUS and S-PLUS, we will be able to distinguish between possible formation scenarios of the MW halo.", "5.1.3 Expected number of halo symbiotic stars", "Given that there is not a luminosity function for SySt, we can not use the same methodology used for PNe to estimate the expected number of SySt in the halo of the Milky Way. Instead, in this section we present the previously estimated number of SySt, thus roughly indicating their expected number in the S- and J-PLUS areas. We perform this task in four di\u000berent ways.", "\u000fBy considering the 40 S-type SySt within 1.0 kpc, data from Freeman (1987) and Gilmore et al. (1989), for the density gradient and the dimension of the thick disk and bulge (Munari & Renzini, 1992).", "\u000fBy estimating the formation rate of RG + WD symbiotic system: rss=rbin\u0003f1\u0003f2\u0003f3 whererbinis the binary formation rate, f1is the fraction of binaries with orbital period, Porb= 1\u000010 yr,f2is the fraction of binary that survive to the \frst tidal mass-loss phase and f3is the fraction of binaries with the secondaries massive enough to evolve to red giant dimensions in the age of the Galaxy. The total number of symbiotic stars follows the relation, Nss=rsstss, where tssis the lifetime of the SySt phase (Kenyon et al., 1993). \u000fBy obtaining a rough estimate of the red giant population in each galaxy can be computed from the K and B magnitudes from LEDA Lyon-Meudon Extra- Chapter 5 Tools to discover planetary and symbiotic nebulae Reference # SySt (all galaxy) # Total (Halo) # J-PLUS # S-PLUS Table 5.3: Expected number of SySt per model and per survey. galactic Database2, the distances (Van den Bergh, 2000) and the contribution in near infrared light of young stars (Chiosi & Vallenari, 1996). A typical luminosity of 100 L\ffor a cool giant is taken in computing the number of red giants per galaxy. The number of symbiotic stars can be taken to be 0.5% of the total number of red giants plus AGB stars (Magrini et al., 2003). \u000fBy considering the galactic birth rate of SySt from the WD accretors in the Galaxy, by means of a population synthesis code (L u et al., 2006). Table 5.3 summarizes these expected numbers of SySt from the four methods. In the Galactic plane the thick disk outnumber the halo by a factor of 10 to 20 (Freeman, 1987). If we suppose that the population of symbiotic meets this same relation, from which it is consider that the population of SySt of the disk is 10 times that of the halo, we can obtain the number of SySt in the Galactic halo and in the total areas covered for J-PLUS and S-PLUS, \u00188;500 deg2and\u00189;000 deg2, respectively (see Table 5.3). For instance, from the L u et al. (2006) results, it is expected between 22 - 281 SySt in J-PLUS and 24 - 297 in S-PLUS. Even though these estimations are not all robust ones, they give us an idea about the population of SySt in the Galactic halo.", "5.1.4 Compact versus extended PNe", "The sizes of the 14 PNe in the Galactic halo go from 1.0 to more than 50 arcsec (Howard et al., 1997). Even though, our tools were developed to search for compact PNe within the photometric catalogs of J-PLUS and S-PLUS using apertures of 6 and 3 arcsec, respectively. In fact, any search for PNe in photometric surveys seems to be complete for those with angular sizes smaller than 6 arcsec (Viironen et al., The larger planetary nebulae with lower density and corresponding lower surface brightness are more di\u000ecult to discover. These objects are essentially undetectable by the survey methods. The cross-matching between the HASH and J-PLUS/S- PLUS catalogs made this point very clear. The magnitudes of the resultant PNe matches correspond only to the photometry of the central WDs, as it can be seen from their photo-spectra, which return no nebular H \u000bemission. 2http://leda.univ-lyon1.fr/ and Fioc & Rocca-Volmerange (1999). Tools to discover planetary and symbiotic nebulae Chapter 5 As in the case of the IPHAS, with the present surveys a parallel work needs to be done in order to \fnd extended PNe (Sabin et al., 2014). It is necessary to bin the images in order to increase the surface brightness of extended nebula and make their recovery feasible by visually inspecting one by one of the surveys' \felds. It will only be worth to persecute such an exercise at a later stage of the surveys' development. An additional important issue is the limit magnitude of the surveys, which ham- pers the detection of very extended sources. The J-PAS survey (which will cover the same sky-area as the J-PLUS survey) will be more e\u000ecient for the discovery of extended PNe due to the larger collective area of the telescope (2.5-m instead of the 0.80-m of those here discussed) as well as deeper images. With the method developed in this work we recovered one PN. Four objects (identi\fed as true, likely or probable) PNe in the HASH catalogue are also present in the J-PLUS and S-PLUS catalogues, but they were not recovered due to their faint and di\u000buse H \u000bemission. So, in total we have 5 potential PNe in the combined area of the J-PLUS DR1 + S-PLUS DR1 data releases. Is this number reasonable? If we assume that the MW halo has a metallicity typical of dwarf galaxies, in the J-PLUS DR1 + S-PLUS DR1, we have estimated that we shall \fnd 7 \u00061 PNe. This estimation, which in itself is purely indicative, is more or less in agreement with the number of PNe recovered in the DR1 of these surveys.", "5.2 Conclusions", "Considering the photometric systems of two twin imaging surveys, and the convo- lution of the spectra of di\u000berent types of strong emission-lines sources, we used the synthetic photometry to select the best combination of \flters to construct colour- colour diagrams from the multi-band \flter systems of J-PLUS and S-PLUS. We re- produced the IPHAS equivalent and constructed four new diagnostic colour-colour diagrams to separate hPNe and SySt from cataclysmic variables, QSOs, extragalac- tic H iiregions, star forming galaxies and young stellar objects, by using the J-PLUS and S-PLUS synthetic photometry. We have found that the two surveys (J-PLUS and S-PLUS) are not completely successful at discriminating low-excitation PNe from H iiregions and SySt from H iiand YSOs.", "There is a high probability that a potential candidate found by our criteria will end up being a genuine PN or SySt, if it is located well within the PN/SySt zones, simultaneously, in the IPHAS equivalent and the other four colour-colour diagrams we proposed. We have validated our colour-colour diagrams through the photometry of the known hPNe H 4-1 and PNG135.9+55.9 observed by J-PLUS during the SVD phase.", "By applying these new colour criteria to the J-PLUS DR1 and S-PLUS DR1, which add up an observed area of the sky of \u00181,190 deg2, we identi\fed one PN and none SySt candidates. The optical spectroscopic follow-up of the candidate unveiled a giant H iiin the UGC 5272 galaxy.", "After cross-matching the J-PLUS DR1 and S-PLUS DR1 with the HASH PN Chapter 5 Tools to discover planetary and symbiotic nebulae catalog, \fve common sources were found. None of these sources is a strong H \u000b emitter. Four of them have photo-spectra with a stronger blue continuum compared to the red one, similar to WDs. In the colour-colour diagrams, these WDs are found to lie in an area below the PNe zone. These HASH sources are located in the zone of very blue WDs. The \ffth source has a photo-spectrum that resembles those of galaxies, not PNe.", "Merrett et al. (2006) have shown that for low luminosities objects it is hard to dis- ringuish between PNe and H iiregions, using the ratio between [O III] and H \u000b+[N II] emission lines. We will further investigate this issue, including morphological crite- ria in the analysis. We have proved that our selection criteria are very e\u000bective to select PN candidates, even considering the contamination by H iiregions/galaxies. However, the machine learning techniques allow a better classi\fcation of classes the objects. Moreover, with these techniques we have achieved to discriminate PNe from Hiiregions/galaxies. We compared two methods based, respectively, on classical colour-colour criteria and PCA and LDA algorithms to classify PNe.

From the approximately ∼3,500 planetary nebulae (PNe) discovered in our Galaxy, only 14 are known to be members of the Galactic halo. Nevertheless, a systematic search for halo PNe has never been performed. Aims. In this study, we present new photometric diagnostic tools to identify compact PNe in the Galactic halo by making use of the novel 12-ﬁlter system projects, J-PLUS (Javalambre Photometric Local Universe Survey) and S-PLUS (Southern-Photometric Local Universe Survey).", "Methods. We reconstructed the IPHAS (Isaac Newton Telescope (INT) Photometric HαSurvey of the Northern Galactic Plane) diagnostic diagram and propose four new ones using i) the J-PLUS and S-PLUS synthetic photometry for a grid of photo-ionisation models of halo PNe, ii) several observed halo PNe, as well as iii) a number of other emission-line objects that resemble PNe. All colour-colour diagnostic diagrams are validated using two known halo PNe observed by J-PLUS during the scientiﬁc veriﬁcation phase and the ﬁrst data release (DR1) of S-PLUS and the DR1 of J-PLUS. Results. By applying our criteria to the DR1s ( ∼1,190 deg2), we identiﬁed one PN candidate. However, optical follow-up spectroscopy proved it to be a H iiregion belonging to the UGC 5272 galaxy. Here, we also discuss the PN and two H iigalaxies recovered by these selection criteria. Finally, the cross-matching with the most updated PNe catalogue (HASH) helped us to highlight the potential of these surveys, since we recover all the known PNe in the observed area. Conclusions. The tools here proposed to identify PNe and separate them from their emission-line contaminants proved to be very eﬃcient thanks to the combination of many colours, even when applied –like in the present work– to an automatic photometric search that is limited to compact PNe.", "Key words. surveys – planetary nebulae: general – ISM: lines and bands – techniques: photometric", "1. Introduction", "Planetary nebulae (PNe) represent the ﬁnal stage of the evolution of low-to-intermediate mass stars ( 0.8-8.0M⊙), when the ejected asymptotic giant branch (AGB) and post-AGB material is ionisedby the UV radiation ﬁeld of the hot and luminous descendant. Due to the high temperature of the central star, a typical PN spectrum shows a great variety of emission lines: not only the recombi- nation lines of the Balmer series and He, but also collisionally excited lines from several elements like O, N, S, Ne, and Ar (e.g. Article number, page 1 of 12 A&A proofs: manuscript no. PN-J-SPLUS_35700corr Figure 1 of Kwitter & Henry 2001). Given the wide range of temperatures of the central stars (50-250) ×103K, some PNe are lower-excitation nebulae, and their spectral characteristics can be very similar to those of H iiregions (Osterbrock & Ferland 2006). The AGB and post-AGB ejecta enrich the interstellar medium (ISM) with heavy elements that were produced during the evo- lution of the progenitor star. Thus, PNe provide important infor- mation about the production and evolution of chemical elements in the local Universe, and even more locally in the Milky Way (for reviews, see Magrini, Stanghellini, & Gonçalves 2012 and Gonçalves 2019).", "In the recent past, several surveys have contributed to the discovery of new PNe. The AAO /UKST HαSurvey (Parker et al. 2005), later called Macquarie /AAO /Strasbourg H αPlanetary Neb- ula Catalogue (MASH catalogue, Parker et al. 2006), Southern HαSky Survey Atlas (SHASSA; Gaustad et al. 2001), Wisconsin HαMapper (WHAM; Ha ﬀner et al. 2003), and the Isaac Newton Telescope (INT) Photometric HαSurvey of the Northern Galactic Plane (IPHAS; Drew et al. 2005), in which a number of PN can- didates have been found in an automated manner (Viironen et al. 2009b,a; Sabin et al. 2010). Small, private surveys have also con- tributed to the discovery of new Galactic PNe (e.g. Boumis et al. 2003, 2006). The most recent compilation of PNe is published in the Hong Kong /AAO /Strasbourg /HαPN database (HASH; Parker et al. 2016). To date, HASH contains 2401 true, 447 likely, and 692 possible Galactic PNe. More genuine PNe candidates have been recently reported in the UKIRT Wide-Field Imaging Survey (UWISH2) of the Northern Galactic Plane (Gledhill et al. 2018) and in the CORNISH catalogue (Irabor et al. 2018; Fragkou et al. So far, only 14 PNe are conﬁrmed members of the Galac- tic halo (Otsuka et al. 2015). These are low-metallicity objects, since they come from the oldest population of the Galaxy, with log(O/H)+12<8.1 (Peimbert 1978). Their height above the Galactic plane and their kinematics are additional criteria to lo- cate them in the halo. Thus, halo PNe (hPNe) show large vertical distances from the Galactic plane, ∼7.2kpc(Otsuka et al. 2015). The understanding of the chemical evolution of the Galaxy can be improved by studying the old and metal-poor PNe located in the halo of our Galaxy, since these stars were born in the earlier phases of Galactic evolution (Otsuka et al. 2015). The Javalambre Photometric Local Universe Survey (J- PLUS1, Cenarro et al. 2019) and the Southern-Photometric Local Universe Survey (S-PLUS2, Mendes de Oliveira et al. 2019) pro- vide observations of the Galactic halo covering both northern and southern celestial hemispheres in a systematic way with twin telescopes using the same set of multi-band ﬁlters. In addition to the Hαﬁlter, which is already vastly applied to systematically searching for Hαemitters such as PNe and symbiotic stars (SySt), the telescopes o ﬀer 11 more ﬁlters. In this work, we present and discuss new colour-colour diagnostic diagrams based on the avail- able ﬁlters from J-PLUS and S-PLUS projects to identify halo planetary nebulae. Our main goal is to validate these tools, in addition to applying them to very ﬁrst J-PLUS and S-PLUS data covering about 1,190 deg2of the sky. We show that the J-PLUS and S-PLUS ﬁlter conﬁguration provide a characterisation of the whole optical spectra of the sources and their potential to such an end with the completion of the surveys, thus opening new horizons for the search of PNe and SySt and other emission line systems.", "1https://www.j-plus.es", "2http://www.splus.iag.usp.brOur paper is organised as follows: in Section 2, we sum- marise the observations related to J-PLUS and S-PLUS projects, as well as important information of the ﬁrst data release for each survey. In Section 3, the synthetic photometry of the di ﬀerent emission-line sources are explored. Section 4 describes our selec- tion method and the new diagnostic diagrams. Section 5 presents the validation of the colour-colour diagrams, using known hPNe observed by J-PLUS, and in terms of sources we recovered within the DR1 area, the PN candidate selected with our methodology. In Section 6 the results obtained after cross-match the J-PLUS and S-PLUS data with the HASH catalogue are discussed. In Section 7, we provide a general discussion and conclusions.", "2. Observations", "J-PLUS is a multi-ﬁlter imaging survey, which is being carried out from the Observatorio Astrofísico de Javalambre (OAJ, Cenarro et al. 2014), using the 83 cm Javalambre Auxiliary Survey Tele- scope (JAST /T80) and the T80Cam camera. This survey, which maps the northern sky, has a southern counterpart, the S-PLUS. The latter uses a twin telescope, the T80-South, located at the Cerro Tololo Interamerican Observatory (CTIO), in Chile. Both telescopes are equipped with cameras that provide a ∼2.0 deg2 ﬁeld of view (FoV) of the sky, and each covers an area of around 8,500 deg2in total. Their ﬁlter systems are made up of 12 ﬁlters spanning the optical range from 3,000 to 10,000Å, approximately. Although the prime goal of the J-PLUS survey is to perform the photometric calibration for the Javalambre Physics of the Acceler- ating Universe Astrophysical Survey (J-PAS; Benítez et al. 2015), it also provides a rich set of photometric data allowing the inves- tigation of many classes of objects in the Galactic halo and in the local universe. For example, given their multi-ﬁlter conﬁguration, they can be used to search for emission-line sources as done by previous narrow-band surveys.", "J-PLUS and S-PLUS ﬁlter sets are formed of seven narrow- J0861. They also include ﬁve broad-band Sloan Digital Sky Sur- vey (SDSS) like ﬁlters ( u,g,r,iandz, Fukugita et al. 1996), which are designed to detect the continuum of the sources. Table 3 and Table 2 of J-PLUS and S-PLUS Papers 0 (Cenarro et al. 2019; Mendes de Oliveira et al. 2019) specify the characteristics of the ﬁlters of the surveys, and the features targeted by the narrow-band ones. The data used here come from J-PLUS scientiﬁc veriﬁca- tion data, the ﬁrst J-PLUS data release, and the ﬁrst S-PLUS data release.", "The J-PLUS survey is growing at ∼1,000 deg2/year. Given the present rate of completion of the S-PLUS tiles, we anticipate that 4,500 deg2may be covered by the end of 2020, and the full survey should be completed by the middle of 2023.", "2.1. J-PLUS scientiﬁc veriﬁcation data", "These scientiﬁc veriﬁcation data (SVD) comprise a group of well-known objects to test and challenge the scientiﬁc capabilities of J-PLUS (Cenarro et al. 2019). The J-PLUS SVD published observations of the galaxy clusters A2589 and A2593, M101, M49, the Arp313 triplet of galaxies, and a few nearby galaxies, including NGC 4470 and the Coma cluster. The Galactic PNe H 4-1 (Miller 1969) and PNG 135.9 +55.9 (Tovmassian et al. 2001) were also included within these data.", "Article number, page 2 of 12 L. A. Gutiérrez-Soto, D. R. Gonçalves, S. Akras, et al.: Tools for compact PNe in J-PLUS and S-PLUS", "2.2. First J-PLUS data release", "The J-PLUS ﬁrst data release (DR13) is composed of 511 ﬁelds observed with the 12 narrow- and broad-band ﬁlters, and it cov- ered 1,022 deg2of the sky. DR1 is based on images collected by the JAST /T80 telescope from November 2015 to January 2018. Around nine million objects are included in this ﬁrst data release. The limiting magnitudes (5 σ, 3/prime/primeaperture) in each ﬁlter are pre- sented in Table 4 of Cenarro et al. (2019). The median point spread function (PSF) in the DR1 r-band images is 1.1/prime/prime. The de- tection of the sources was done in the r-band using SExtractor (Bertin & Arnouts 1996), and the photometry in the 12 J-PLUS bands at the position of the detected sources was made using the aperture deﬁned in the r-band image. Di ﬀerent types of aper- tures were used to perform the photometry: i) circular aperture photometry ( SExtractor ’sMAG_APER ) with apertures of dif- ferent sizes (3/prime/primeand 6/prime/prime), ii) isophotal photometry ( SExtractor ’s MAG_ISO ), iii) Kron photometry ( SExtractor ’sMAG_AUTO , iv) Petrosian photometry ( SExtractor ’sMAG_PETRO ), v) pho- tometry after degrading the images of all the bands to the worst PSF, vi) photometry after convolving all the images with a Gaus- sian kernel of σ=1.5/prime/prime,and vii) photometry applying a PSF cor- rection as that applied in (Molino et al. 2014). In the present work, we use the 6/prime/primeaperture. This choice follows the automatic method used by IPHAS photometry to ﬁnd compact PNe, with a small angular diameter (typically ≤5/prime/prime, Viironen et al. 2009a). The 6/prime/prime-aperture chosen also follows Akras, Guzman-Ramirez, & Gonçalves (2019c), who found that PNe with angular sizes larger than 6/prime/primeexhibit very low ( r−Hα) colour index.", "2.3. First S-PLUS data release", "The S-PLUS DR14includes 80 ﬁelds of the Stripe-82 area, a rectangular area with coordinates 4h<RA<20hand -1.26◦< Dec<1.26◦. These ﬁelds were observed during the scientiﬁc val- idation process of the survey. DR1 contains about one million sources, and the limiting magnitude of each ﬁlter is presented in Table 8 of the S-PLUS presentation paper (Mendes de Oliveira et al. 2019). Sources were detected using SExtractor . Photome- try was performed by adopting three types of aperture: i) a circular aperture of 3/prime/primein diameter ( SExtractor ’sAPER ), ii) Kron pho- tometry ( SExtractor ’sAUTO ), and iii) petrosian photometry (SExtractor ’sPETRO ). Similarly to the case of J-PLUS, we use the circular aperture of 3/prime/prime. This aperture is the best within the three possibilities, since – in addition to the arguments given in Section 2.2 – it ensures that large objects with high surface brightness, like emission-line galaxies or H iiregions, are not recovered (with this automated method).", "The tools we use to identify PNe in the two surveys are syn- thetic photometry and colour-colour diagrams, which we describe in detail in the following sections.", "3. Synthetic photometry", "In order to recover the synthetic photometry of PNe and their contaminants, we follow the procedure developed by Aparicio Villegas et al. (2010), who characterised the ALHAMBRA pho- tometric system. The magnitudes of any photometric system are deﬁned by a set of AB magnitudes (Oke & Gunn 1983): 4https://datalab.noao.edu/splus/where the constant is obtained from the equation F0=3.63×10−20erg s−1cm−2Hz−1being the ﬂux of Vega atλ=5,500Å. The term fνis the ﬂux per unit of frequency The synthetic photometry is obtained from the convolution of the observed or modelled spectra with the transmission function or pass-band of a speciﬁc photometric system. The transmission function accounts for the transmission ﬁlter, the reﬂectivity of the telescope mirror, the transmission of the camera optics and the quantum e ﬃciency of the detector used (Bessell 2005). By considering these characteristics of the photometric system, Eq. 1 turns to ABλ=−2.5 log1 c/integraltext fλSλλdλ/integraltext where cis the light speed, Sνis the transmission function, and the units of fλare [erg s−1cm−2Å−1]. Therefore, Eq. 3 makes it possible to estimate the synthetic photometry (AB magnitude) in a speciﬁc photometric system.", "The synthetic photometry or photo-spectra of several emission-line sources – PNe, SySt, cataclysmic variables (CVs), quasi-stellar objects (QSO), extragalactic H iiregions, young stel- lar objects (YSOs), B[e] stars, and star-forming galaxies (SFGs) – were obtained through the convolution of the theoretical transmis- sion curves of the J-PLUS and S-PLUS systems with the available optical spectra, as in Eq. 3.", "The same procedure was also applied to a grid of photoioni- sation models for hPNe to obtain their synthetic magnitudes. For the hPN modelling, we adopted the photoionisation code, cloudy (Ferland et al. 2013). The initial parameters used to compute the models reﬂect the typical properties of the PN population located in the Galactic halo. They represent di ﬀerent sets of nebular abun- dances, with electron densities of 1,000 cm−3, 3,000 cm−3and 6,000 cm−3, of a spherically symmetric nebula with a radius of 2.7/prime/prime, at distance of 10 kpc. Central star (black body) e ﬀective temperatures from 50,000 K to 250,000 K, in steps of 10 ×103K, and luminosities of 500, 1,000, 5,000 and 10,000 L ⊙were consid- ered. We reddened the modelled spectra applying the reddening curve by Fitzpatrick (1999), and using two di ﬀerent colour ex- cesses, E(B - V) =0.1 and 0.2, following the J-PLUS and S-PLUS average extinction of E(B - V) =0.1 (Cenarro et al. 2019; Mendes de Oliveira et al. 2019).", "Figure 1 comprises all synthetic photo-spectra recovered as explained above. Panels ( a) and ( b) display the photo-spectra of the Galactic hPN DdDm 1 (Kwitter & Henry 1998), and of an extragalactic PN located in NGC 205 (Gonçalves et al. 2014), as examples. Both objects show strong Hαemission, with a contin- uum a little more intense in the blue than in the red part of the spectrum. Panels ( c) and ( d) show two cloudy modelled hPNe. Both have the same chemical abundance (equivalent to that of the hPN DdDm 1), and the same luminosity of 104L⊙. The e ﬀective temperature and density of the model in panel ( c) are of 60×103K and 1,000 cm−3and for the model in panel ( d) of200×103K and 6,000 cm−3, respectively. So, the ﬁrst model (panel c) corresponds to a low-excitation PN. The ionising star is not hot enough to pro- duce such an [O iii] emission able to stand out signiﬁcantly in the gbroad-band magnitude. The second model (panel d) represents a high-excitation PN. In this case, the magnitude of the gbroad- band ﬁlter is impacted by the strong [O iii] and [He ii] emission lines.

The hPNe (modelled or ob- served) di ﬀer from Galactic-disc PNe in size, velocity, distance, and extinction (Howard et al. 1997; Otsuka et al. 2015). All the properties – high distances implying small angular sizes, poor in metals and low extinction – of hPNe, with the exception of the large velocities, make them occupy a speciﬁc locus in the colour-colour diagrams, signiﬁcantly di ﬀerent to that of the disc In addition to PNe, we also computed the photo-spectra of a number of other emission-line sources that mimic PNe. Panel (e) of Figure 1 shows the photo-spectrum of an extragalactic Hiiregion located in the dwarf galaxy NGC 55 (Magrini et al. 2017), in which the Hαemission is also perceptible. The low- excitation PN (on panel c) and the H iiregion show very similar photo-spectra, which will make them hard to distinguish within the J-PLUS and S-PLUS catalogues. Merrett et al. (2006) have shown that for low-luminosity objects, it is hard to distinguish PNe and H iiregions, using the ratio between [O iii] and Hα+[Nii] emission lines. We encounter the same problem here, even using a wider range of wavelengths. We further investigate this issue, including morphological criteria, in Section 5. With the exception of the morphology, the same di ﬃculty occurs for H iigalaxies, as is shown in panel g, for a SDSS H iigalaxy. At this point, it should be noted that the synthetic photometric magnitudes are below the limiting magnitudes for all the ﬁlters bluer than 4,500Å, in the case of the extragalactic PN (panel b), and for uandJ0378 ﬁlters in the case of the extragalactic H iiregion (panel e). Panel ( f) of Figure 1 presents the photo-spectrum of the SySt LMC1 (Munari & Zwitter 2002), displaying a clear Hαemis- sion with an increasing continuum to the longer wavelengths. The resolution of the J-PLUS and S-PLUS photometry allows to perceive undoubtedly the reddened nature of the SySt. As PNe, symbiotic stars are also constituted by an evolved star, in most cases a white dwarf (WD). They are interacting binary systems with a cold giant companion (red giant or Mira star) and an evolved hot star. The wind of the giant is ionized by the UV radiation from the evolved companion, thus resulting in a spectrum composed by both absorption features from the stellar photo-sphere of the giant (e.g. TiO and VO), and emission line features from the excited ions (Munari & Zwitter 2002; Corradi, Mikolajewska, & Mahoney 2003; Rodríguez-Flores et al. 2014; Iłkiewicz & Mikołajewska 2017; Akras et al. 2019; Angeloni et al. 2019). The photo-spectrum of a cataclysmic variable (CV) selected from the SDSS catalogue is also presented in Figure 1 (panel i). Cataclysmic variables are interacting binary systems, in which a white dwarf accretes gas from a main-sequence star, via Roche lobe outﬂow, forming an accretion disc. The Balmer lines are produced in the optically thin outer regions of the disc (Williams 1980). It is simple to notice that based on their photo- spectra, PNe of high and low excitation could be mistaken for CVs. Panel ( h) brings the convolution results for a YSO, from Al- calá et al. (2014). An accretion disc, from where the Hαemission emerges, is also present in this type of (pre-main-sequence) stars. The YSO’s photometry shows a continuum that is stronger in the red part of the spectrum. Panel ( j) displays a B[e] star (Lamers et al. 1998). B[e] stars have a surrounding nebula produced by large-scale mass loss involving one or more eruptions (Marston & McCollum 2006). Its photo-spectrum resembles that of both SySt and YSOs.", "The J-PLUS and S-PLUS synthetic spectra of several SDSS QSOs, in speciﬁc redshift ( z) ranges, were also included in our se- lection of emission-line objects.

Akras, et al.: Tools for compact PNe in J-PLUS and S-PLUS tures that resemble those of PNe, in other words, they could be misinterpreted as Hαline emission at z=0. At these redshift ranges, respectively, the C iv1550 Å, C iii] 1909 Å and Mg ii2798 Å emission lines of QSOs fall into the J0660 (Hα) ﬁlter. In panel (k)of Figure 1, we have a QSO at z=1.4, in which the excess of emission in the J0660 ﬁlter comes from the contribu- tion of the Mg iiemission line. Two more QSOs are presented in Figure 1: at z=2.5(panel l) and z=3.3(panel m). At these redshifts, the C iii] and C ivemission lines are also detected in the J0660 band. The magnitudes of the J0430 band for the QSO at z=2.5,and of the J0515 band for the QSOs at z=3.3,indicate strong emissions, which are provided by the L αemission in both cases. Panel (n)of Figure 1 shows a star-forming galaxy from the SDSS. Its photo-spectrum exhibits a moderate Hαemission and a continuum increasing for longer wavelengths. This is because these objects are embedded in hot gas and dust. Despite the fact that QSOs have strong emission lines that can be misidentiﬁed as Hα, their photo spectra are only moderately similar to those of PNe. It is worth mentioning that J-PLUS and S-PLUS can char- acterise not only the strong emission lines, but also the continua of these objects, thus allowing us to correctly di ﬀerentiate QSO from PNe, which was a problematic task in projects dedicated to the search of PNe, which were using a fewer ﬁlters. Finally, we note that SFGs and YSOs have photo-spectra that are very diﬀerent from those presented in Panel aand Panel b,and so they do not cause much impact on our research work.", "4. Synthetic colour-colour diagrams: selection", "criteria The photo-spectra of the emission-line sources just discussed in Figures 1 – for PNe, SySt, CVs, B[e], QSOs, extragalactic H ii regions, YSOs, and SFGs – are now used to build diagnostic colour-colour diagrams. Our goal is to pinpoint the most relevant ones to discriminate PNe from the above systems.", "4.1. IPHAS equivalent colour-colour diagram", "Drew et al. (2005) designed the IPHAS survey (see Section 1) showing that the (r/prime−Hα)vs(r/prime−i)diagram is an optimal tool to select strong Hαemission-line sources (Witham et al. 2008). IPHAS PNe candidates were selected using the above colour-colour diagram as well as the common (J−H)vs (H− Ks)2MASS diagram. Their true nature was conﬁrmed later on, spectroscopically (Corradi et al. 2008; Viironen et al. 2009b; Rodríguez-Flores et al. 2014; Sabin et al. 2014). Given that the J-PLUS and S-PLUS ﬁlter systems include the three IPHAS ﬁlters, we reconstructed the IPHAS equivalent diagram in Figure 2. The (r−J0660 ) colour clearly indicates an increasing excess of the Hαemission line, while the (r−i)one increases with the reddening, as previously stated in Corradi et al. (2008). Modelled PNe are found to display (r−J0660)>0.6due to their strong Hαemission lines as well as (r−i)<0. It should be noted that Figure 1 of Viironen et al. (2009b) shows that Galactic disc PNe have (r−i)<1, so they are redder than the hPNe. The empirical (black) lines delimit the selection criteria for being PNe (PNe zone) and are meant to include most of the modelled hPNe and exclude the majority of the contaminants. The deﬁnition of the selection criteria or zones has been made visually. This holds for the IPHAS equivalent as well as the new colour-colour diagrams of the present study.

Therefore, our lists of PN candidates are not characterised by high purity. The distribution of main sequence (MS) and giant stars (purple and brown symbols in the inset ﬁgures) in the ( r-J0660) vs (r-i) diagnostic diagram is such that both groups of stars occupy regions with lower ( r-J0660) index ( <1.2) and higher ( r-i) index (>0) than the PNe zone (Drew et al. 2005; Corradi et al. 2008). White dwarf (WD) stars (light green symbols in inset ﬁgures) also present low ( r-J0660) index ( >0), however exhibit ( r-i) colour >−1. Thus, there is no mixing between PNe and the bulk of MS, giant and WD stars. The observed PNe are well located in the PNe zone with high (r−J0660)>1(see also Viironen et al.

New J-PLUS and S-PLUS colour-colour diagrams Studying the photo-spectra of the PNe and their contaminants (Section 3), four new colour-colour diagrams were deﬁned for PN candidates in the J-PLUS and S-PLUS catalogues. In the ﬁrst diagnostic diagram, high- and low-excitation PNe occupy distinct regions within the PNe zone. For instance, H 4-1, a moderate high-ionisation PN, exhibits (g−J0515)≈−2, with Te f faround 132×103K (Henry et al. (1996)), and MWC 574, a very low-excitation PN with (g−J0515)≈0.0, exhibits an [O iii] emission even weaker than H β(Sanduleak & Stephenson 1972; Pereira & Miranda 2007). The ( J0515−J0861 ) colour index is associated with the continuum of the sources. Neither of these two ﬁlters contains strong emission lines. The ( J0515−J0660 ) colour provides an estimation of the H αexcess.", "Regarding the second diagnostic diagram, the ( g−J0515 ) colour index yields the excess of the [O iii] lines. Therefore, the higher the ( g−J0515 ) colour, the higher the excitation of the nebula. This can be seen from the photo-spectra of two cloudy models with di ﬀerent stellar temperatures (panels canddin Figure 1). We remind the reader, however, that the gbroad-band ﬁlter is also a ﬀected by the H βand other emission lines down to about 4,000Å. The ( J0660−r) colour is to illustrate the Hα emission as it has been explained in the previous section. The ( z−J0660 ) colour index also gives us an estimation of theHαexcess, by taking into account the continuum at the very red part of the spectrum, while the ( z−g) colour is directly related to the shape of the continuum from the blue to the red part of the spectrum. The QSOs and SFGs are concentrated in a very small area (−2<(z−J0660)<1and−2<(z−g)<1), well separated from PNe.", "Finally, ( g−i) is another colour index associated with the shape of the continuum, and the ( J0410−J0660 ) colour reﬂects theHαexcess, though using di ﬀerent parts of the spectrum in contrast with the previous diagrams. From panel din Figure 3, we ﬁnd that QSOs and SFGs show an increase in the ( J0410−J0660 ) colour as a function of the ( g−i) colour, while PNe appear to have a more restricted range of ( g−i) values between -2 and 0, and vs (g−i) colour-colour diagram can distinguish PNe from galaxies. The SySt and YSOs are found to lie in the right part of the plot ((g−i)>2), which is indicative of their stronger emission in the near-IR. This last diagnostic diagram turns out to be very useful to assure low contamination by B[e] stars, di ﬀering from the ﬁrst three diagrams.", "Figure 3 and the colour-colour diagrams also show the loci of main sequence, giant and white dwarf stars, which clearly do not a ﬀect the PN selection criteria. Leaving aside the H ii regions, all the colour-colour diagrams turned out to be very useful for identifying good PN and SySt candidates (a detailed analysis for SySt is to be presented in a forthcoming paper). The combination of several narrow- and broad-band ﬁlters to construct colour-colour diagrams allows characterising the whole optical spectrum of every source type. If a source simultaneously satisﬁes all the criteria of being a PN, the possibility of false positive identiﬁcation, though not negligible, is small.", "5. Validation of the colour-colour diagrams", "Aiming to validate the tools to search for PNe in J-PLUS and S-PLUS, we followed two di ﬀerent methods.

In order to ﬁnd the calibrated magni- tudes, we used the zero point provided by the unit of processing and data analysis (UPAD) inside the J-PLUS collaboration. The resulting photo-spectra are shown in Figure 15 of the J-PLUS presentation paper (Cenarro et al. 2019). In Table 1, we compare the synthetic and observed magnitudes of these hPNe. For H 4-1, the two magnitudes are very compatible, with a di ﬀerence smaller than 0.07, except for the uandJ0378 ﬁlters, whose di ﬀerences are 0.4 and 0.23, respectively. As for PNG 135.9 +55.9, the synthetic and observed magnitudes are found to be in very good agreement, with, on average, a di ﬀerence smaller than 0.1 mag. The only discrepant magnitude is the one of the J0660 ﬁlter, for which the diﬀerence reaches 0.35 mag.", "The positions of H 4-1 and PNG 135.9 +55.9 in the colour- colour diagrams –based on their J-PLUS observations– are shown in Figures 2 and 3 as yellow and green stars, respectively.

We note, however, that this PN is located close to the border of the PN zone. This border was deﬁned in a conservative way, to avoid more contamination of H iiregions and SySt, since low-excitation PNe and H iiregions are extremely hard to di ﬀerentiate.", "5.2.

To ensure the recovery of the largest amount of potential candidates due to lack of detection in some ﬁlters, we explore how the limiting magnitude errors for di ﬀerent sets of ﬁlters a ﬀect the results: (i) by limiting the error associated with the magnitudes corresponding to IPHAS-like magnitudes ( i,r andJ0660), and admitting any error for the other 9 photometries, (ii) by limiting the magnitude errors of the J0660 and broad-band ﬁlters, and ﬁnally, (iii) by limiting the magnitude errors of all narrow- and broad-band ﬁlters.

This option accounts for the fact that the continuum of PNe is usu- ally faint, with the consequence of uncertain photometry (large errors) in the narrow-band ﬁlters.

As in the case of IPHAS, a parallel study needs to be done in order to ﬁnd extended PNe (Sabin et al. 2014). It is necessary to bin the images in order to increase the surface brightness of the extended nebula and make their recovery feasible by visually inspecting one by one the images of the surveys. In conclusion, we considered the photometric systems of two twin imaging surveys (J-PLUS and S-PLUS), by using the synthetic photometry of di ﬀerent types of strong emission-line sources, to select the best combination of ﬁlters and construct diagnostic colour-colour diagrams to isolate hPNe. We repro- duced the equivalent IPHAS and proposed four new diagnostic colour-colour diagrams to separate hPNe from SySt, CVs, B[e] stars, QSOs, extragalactic H iiregions, star-forming galaxies, and young stellar objects. We ﬁnd that the there is a high probability that a candidate found by our criteria will end up being a gen- uine PN if it is located well within the PN zones in the IPHAS equivalent and the other four colour-colour diagrams we pro- posed. It is also true that J-PLUS and S-PLUS are not completely successful at discriminating low-excitation PNe from compact Hiiregions (H iigalaxies). We have validated our colour-colour diagrams through the photometry of the known hPNe H 4-1 and PNG 135.9 +55.9 observed by J-PLUS during the SVD phase, and by applying them to the J-PLUS DR1 and S-PLUS DR1, which make up an observed area of the sky of ∼1,190 deg2. Having proven that our selection criteria are very e ﬀective in selecting PN candidates, even considering the contamination by H iiregions /galaxies, we intend to continuously apply these photometric tools to the forthcoming J-PLUS and S-PLUS data releases, to provide a more complete list of hPN candidates for spectroscopic follow-up.Acknowledgements.

San Juan 1, E-44001, Teruel, Spain Abstract. From the approximately 3,000 planetary nebulae (PNe) discovered in our Galaxy, only 14 are found to be members of the halo. Moreover, a systematic search for halo PNe was never done. We have developed tools to identify PNe in the Javalambre-Physics of the Accelerating Universe Astrophysical Survey (J-PAS) and related surveys, S-PLUS and J-PLUS, taking advantage of their great combination of narrow- and broad-band ﬁlters. The spectra of several classes of emission-line objects, which were convolved to the three photometric systems, were applied to the principal component analysis in order to ﬁnd the most adequate combinations of colour to discriminate halo PNe from other objects. Here we propose colour-colour diagrams, based on these spectra. The diagrams separate halo PN candidates from other sources that resemble PNe (symbiotic stars; star-forming galaxies; cataclysmic variables; QSOs and extragalactic H II regions). We include, in our preliminary results, the photometry of a couple of halo PNe actually observed by the J-PLUS survey. Altogether, we show it is possible to discriminate halo PNe from other sources using di ﬀerent techniques which enclose important spectral nebular features. Resumo. Das aproximadamente 3000 nebulosas planetárias (NPs) descobertos em nosso Galáxia, apenas 14 são membros do halo. Além disso, uma busca sistemática de NPs do halo nunca foi feita. Desenvolvemos ferramentas para detectar essas fontes no Javalambre-Physics of the Accelerating Universe Astrophysical Survey (J-PAS) e nos surveys, S-PLUS e J-PLUS, aproveitando sua ótima combinação de ﬁltros estreitos e largos. Os espectros de vários tipos de objetos com linhas de emissão, que foram convolvidos para os três sistemas fotométricos, foram utilizados com a análise de componentes principais para encontrar as combinações de cor mais adequadas para discriminar NPs do halo de outros objetos. Aqui propomos novos diagramas cor-cor, que separam as NPs de outras fontes com linhas (estrelas simbióticas, galáxias formadoras de estrelas, variáveis cataclísmicas, QSOs e regiões H II extragalácticas). Incluímos em nossos resultados, a fotometria de um par de NPs observadas por J-PLUS. Ao todo, mostramos que é possível discriminar NPs de outras fontes usando diferentes técnicas que envolvem importantes características espectrais. Keywords. Galaxy: halo – planetary nebulae – ISM: lines and bands", "1. Motivation", "Planetary nebulae (PNe) are a kind of emission line nebula that represent a short phase of the stellar evolution of low- and intermediate-mass stars (0.8 M⊙- 8.0 M⊙). During the un- stable AGB phase, stars eject their outer layers into the inter- stellar medium resulting in an enrichment in heavy elements. Approximately, 3,000 PNe have been identiﬁed in our Galaxy (Parker et al. 2012). Of these, only fourteen objects are located in the Galactic halo (Otsuka et al. 2015). Halo PNe are inter- esting objects because they provide important information about the evolution of old and low-mass stars of in the halo, and allow the early chemical conditions of the Galaxy to be studied. A number of new Galactic PNe were identiﬁed in the equa- torial plane (Viironen et al. 2009) by using the ( r/prime−Hα) vs (r/prime−i/prime) colour-colour diagram in the Isaac Newton Telescope (INT) Photometric H αSurvey of the Northern Galactic Plane (IPHAS; Drew et al. 2005). The multi-ﬁlter J-PAS, J-PLUS1and S-PLUS2surveys are more suitable surveys for searching PNe in the direction of Galactic halo. The combination of narrow- and broad-band ﬁlters in these surveys (in total, 56, 12 and 12, respectively) allow us to identify objects with prominent emis- sion lines. We use the principal component analysis (PCA) to search for the most adequate combination of colours that distin- guish halo PNe from their contaminants. Several colour–colour 1The Javalambre-Photometric Local Universe Survey 2The Southern Photometric Local Universe Surveydiagrams have been generated and explored in order to separate halo PNe from other emission line objects.", "2. Results", "The synthetic magnitudes of various classes of objects were cal- culated for the ﬁlters in the three surveys, using available ob- served spectra, and a set of photo-ionization models for halo PNe. The spectra of PNe: DdDm-1, NGC 242 and MWC 574 were taken from Kwitter & Henry (1998), Kwitter et al. (2003) and Pereira & Miranda (2007), respectively, while the spectra of PNe H 4-1 and PNG 135.9 +55.9 were obtained from the SDSS. The spectra of the rest of the objects: cataclysmic variables (CVs), star-forming galaxies and quasistellar objects (QSOs) with di ﬀerent redshift ranges are also from SDSS. Galactic disk symbiotic stars (SySts) were taken from Munari & Zwitter (2002) and IPHAS (Rodríguez-Flores et al. 2014), while the ex- tragalactic SySts in IC10, NGC 185 and in NGC 205 were gath- ered from Gonçalves et al. (2015). Finally, H II regions in NGC 55 (Magrini et al. 2017) are also included in this analysis. Fig. 1 displays the S-PLUS colour-colour diagram (J0515 – J0660) vs (J0515 – J0861). Halo PNe with strong H αemission are placed at the upper left. The J-PLUS colour-colour diagram (J0660 – gSDSS) vs (J0660 – rSDSS) is presented in Fig. 2. Note that the known PNe: H 4-1 and PNG135.9 +55.9 (blue and green circles with errorbars, respectively) observed in the J-PLUS sur- vey, during the phase of the data science veriﬁcation, are located L.

These models represent di ﬀerent sets of nebular abundances, with densities of 6000 cm−3(ﬁlled symbols) and 3000 cm−3(empty symbols), for a spherically symmetric nebula of 2 .7/prime/primein radius, at a distance of 10 kpc.

The rest of the symbols are as follows: halo PNe (black circles); QSOs with redshift in the range from 0.01 to 1.0 (light green circles); 1.01 to 2.0 (light orange stars); 2.01 to 3.0 (light orange triangles); 3.01 to 4.0 (light blue diamonds); and 4.01 to 5.0 (green boxes), CVs (violet circles); star-forming galaxies (black, open triangles); symbiotic stars (red boxes); extragalactic symbiotic stars (red diamonds); symbiotic stars from IPHAS (red triangles); extragalactic H II region (gray diamonds).", "very close to the regime where halo PNe are expected. The J- PAS colour-colour diagram (J4200 – J5001) vs. (J4200 – J8400) is shown in Fig. 3. The J4200 - J5001 colour is prominent for modelled and some observed halo PNe, due to the strong [O III] emission. The halo PNe MWC 574 and PNG135.9 +55.9 are found at the bottom side of the diagram in the regime of QSOs. This may be associated with the very low O abundance in these PNe (e. g. Sandin et al. 2010), which results in a J4200 – J5001 colour index close to zero. A combination of colours from narrow- and broad-band ﬁlters seems to be e ﬃcient in the identiﬁcation of PNe.", "Acknowledgements.

L. Guasca Garnica1, O. L. Ram´ ırez Su´ arez2, B. Oostra Vannoppen3, G. Chaparro Molano2, and O. A. Restrepo Gait´ an2 We present the results of spectroscopic observations in the range of 4280-6800 ˚A of AB Aur, a Herbig Ae/Be type star. These observations were carried out at the Observatory of the Universidad de los Andes in Bogot´ a - Colombia in 2015. We select the 4280-6000 ˚A spectral window for ﬁtting our data to a black-body model of the star. In this range, the ef- fects due to circumstellar disk emission are negligible and the nighborhood of the prominent accretion H α emission line is neglected. In this window the domi- nant lines due atomic processes are the Balmer series lines H βand H γ. We remove data around 3 σfor each of these lines in order to ignore quantum eﬀects. We model the stellar continuum by doing a Monte Carlo bootstrap-sampled ﬁtting of three parameters: (i) a bolometric correction factor due to atmospheric ab- sorption and/or defect electronics, (ii) measured (rel- ative) continuum ﬂux, and (iii) stellar temperature Teﬀ. We obtain a value for the stellar temperature of 9400K-9700K, in agreement with the temperature reported by Tannirkulam et al. 2008. We also suc- cessfully ﬁtted the H lines using a two-component gaussian ﬁt, which shows the eﬀects of stellar wind on top of the gas accretion onto the star. Our mea- surements strongly suggest that even in the harsh ob- servational conditions present in Colombia, it is pos- sible to obtain quality astronomical data for teaching astrophysics at an undergraduate level.", "1Semillero de Astronom´ ıa, Universidad Pedag´ ogica Nacional, Bogot´ a, Colombia.", "2Grupo de Simulaci´ on, An´ alisis y Modelado (SiAMo), Uni- versidad ECCI, Bogot´ a, Colombia (oramirezs@ecci.edu.co). 3Observatorio Astron´ omico, Universidad de los Andes, Bo- got´ a, Colombia.IDENTIFYING GALACTIC HALO PN CANDIDATES IN THE IMAGING SURVEYS:", "J-PLUS/S-PLUS AND J-PAS L.

Viironen4, and the J-PAS Collaboration Halo planetary nebulae (HPNe) are able to reveal im- portant information about stellar and chemical evo- lution in galaxies. Their characteristic low contin- uum and strong emission lines make them good ob- jects to be searched by multi-ﬁlter imaging surveys. Given that only 14 HPNe are known in the Galaxy, we are exploring colour-colour diagrams to search for these sources in Javalambre/Southern Photometric Local Universe Survey (J-PLUS/S-PLUS) and the Javalambre-Physics of the Accelerating Universe As- trophysical Survey (J-PAS). They are narrow- and broad-band imaging cosmological surveys, with 12 and 54 ﬁlters, respectively.", "The J-PAS survey will be able to observe 8500 deg2of Northern sky, it will detect sources up to magnitude m AB∼23. In the case of the J-PLUS sur- vey the limit magnitudes is around m AB∼21.5. The S-PLUS survey will observe more than 6000 deg2 and it will map the Southern sky.", "Other optical emission lines sources, such as Galactic and extragalactic symbiotic stars (SySts), cataclysmic variables (CVs), QSOs at diﬀerent red- shifts, star-forming galaxies (SFGs), extragalactic H II regions and supernova remnants (SNR) can mimic PNe. Therefore, we explore diﬀerent colour- colour diagrams in order to highlight those that can better identify HPN candidates, separating them from these other objects.", "1Observat´ orio do Valongo, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro, Ladeira Pedro Antonio 43, 20080-090 Rio de Janeiro, Brazil (lgutierrez@astro.ufrj.br).", "2Observat´ orio Nacional, MCTI, Brazil.", "3IAG, Universidade de S˜ ao Paulo, Brazil.", "4Centro de Estudios de F´ ısica del Cosmos de Arag´ on, Spain. 5Instituto de Astrof´ ısica de Andaluc´ ıa, Spain."]}

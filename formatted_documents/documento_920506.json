A nation with a position in the group of the twenty strongest world economies that, at the same time, occupies the 106th place in the Transparency International integrity index ranking, and raises attention because of its unethical outputs. In this context, the thesis sought to penetrate the BE field to favor the necessary diagnos is for a country that intends to move toward lower corruption levels in business environments . The research is developed in four papers. The first investigate s the field of moral philosophies, as it is the main academic way to refer to ethics position s. A bibliometric study is presented, revealing the most relevant methods and guidelines to fill Brazilian gaps. The second paper applies one of those methods and survey s 410 workers from a Brazilian organization, allowing the comparison between Brazilian s' ethics position s and other nations ' data. The result shows that Brazilia ns present, in a comparative way, a high ethical standard , despite the latent corruption disguised in the society. The third paper scrutinize s the applied scale result s to test the resilience of the psychometric instruments and to find the relation between the constructs and six demographic variables. Thus, the measurement invariance of idealism and relativism concerning the demographic variable s was investigated . The results show that several demographic variables affect the measurement of the idealism and relativism scales. Finally, in the fourth paper , tests with two new scales were performed to provide a comparative analysis between the ethics position s (idealism and relativism ), ethical climate , and worker behavior , through production deviance dimension (PD) . The results show that a lower PD mean is positively related to higher idealism and to a stronger perception of ethical climate, whereas no meaningful relation was found between PD means and relativism levels.", "Keywords : moral philosophy; business ethics; idealism; relativism; ethics position; measurement invariance ; production deviance, ethical climate.", "RESUMO", "KROPF, Pedro Delduque.

The advent of globalization and virtual communication allows quick comparisons between nations. Regarding ethics, Brazil has been in evidence on the world stage. It occupies a position in the group of the twe nty strongest world economies (Barbier, 2020). At the same time, however, Brazil is the 106th nation in the integrity index ranking (Transparency International, 2020).", "In addition, in 2015, several police investigations were launched, revealing corruption schemes between public and private business sectors. Those investigations provoked a considerable impact on Brazilian politics. Several prominent politicians have been arrested since then, among them a former president, senators, congressmen, former govern ors, etc. Those circumstances favored a president 's impeachment, as well as the rise of new groups to the highest positions of the federal government.", "In this context, the theme of business ethics (BE) plays a central role. The major corruption scandals in volved Petrobras , one of the largest companies in Brazil (Oliveira, 2020) . Thus, since then, the population 's demand for ethical behavior in politics and institutions has grown enormously ( Garcia & Teodósio, 2020 ). However, before 2015, Brazil was already known to have a negative reputation in business ethics ( Halter, Arruda & Halter, 2009; Forte, Domingues & Oliveira, 2015 ). Brazilians ' negative reputation is not restricted to the business field, the national culture itself favors unethical behavior at som e level (Filgueiras, 2009). Evidence shows that Brazil and most of its neighboring countries have never given BE proper attention (Robertson, Olson, Gilley & Bao, 2008), reinforcing a culture of neglect on the subject. However, the new global conjuncture f urthers BE 's topics. Therefore, the moment is favorable for ethics studies, and there is an effort in favor of filling in the established historical gaps.", "This research is part of this effort. It aims to meet the demand for answers, information, and tools to facilitate the diagnosis of Brazil and Brazilians ' ethical questions. Thus, the main focus of this study was the measurement of the individual ethical system. The research started identifying the main tools available for this purpose and applying one of them in a Brazilian organization. We also looked for other i nstruments that could help the ethical diagnosis in organizations at the institutional level. As a result, two other international measurement scales were identified, translated, and applied to achieve this objective.", "1.1 Idealism and relativism scales", "These scales are part of the method developed by Donelson Forsyth (1980) for measuring and identifying people 's ethical position s. The author developed a methodology to identify a person 's ethical profile by measuring idealism and relativism dimensions. These scales have been widely validated and used in international research, especially in the field of Many researchers sought to identify behavioral patterns through idealism or relativism levels. The number of international surveys allowed Forsyth, O 'Boyle, and McDaniel (2008) to perform a meta -analysis on 139 published surveys. Their article compared the idealism and relativism means of 29 nations, identifying each one 's predominant ethical profile. However, these scales have never been translated to be use d in Portuguese by Brazilians. As a result, the authors did not include Brazil in the meta -analysis, and its ethical profile position compared to the other 29 nations was still unknown.", "Thus, our research aimed to correct these gaps. We attested the potent ial of these scales against other methods (first paper). We translated, adapted, validated, and applied them effectively comparing Brazil to the other 29 nations present in the meta -analysis (second paper).", "Furthermore, deepening into the literature, we fo und another gap. It was the cross of demographic variables with idealism and relativism scores. Many researchers have looked for it. However, as we have checked, they did not use the most recommended methodology. They have compared groups of analysis witho ut checking the psychometric instrument measurement invariance (MI), as suggested by specialists (Damásio, 2013). Thus, our third paper analyzed six demographic variables (age, gender, education, ethics training, career type, and leadership position), chec king MI before comparing idealism and relativism latent means between groups. This study revealed relevant information about variables that could not be compared, as the scales did not prove they could equivalently measure the construct s among the analyzed groups. However, regarding the variables with proved MI, we were able to make more robust crossed analyses of the groups ' latent means.", "1.2 Ethical climate and production deviance scales", "Our research also looked for a behavioral test of i dealism and relativism dimensions. Besides that, we looked to further expand the Brazilian BE studies in a Brazilian public company. Thus, in the fourth paper, we brought the production deviance (PD) scale to review them together with idealism and relativi sm and the organizations ' perceived ethical climate PD aims to measure the extent to which organizations are affected by the diversion of human resources (working time, the commitment of workers, procrastination, among other things). It has been a p roblem that affects organizations due to its direct impact on productivity (Guay et al., 2016). PD is estimated to cost organizations worldwide billions of dollars (Bennett, Marasi, & Locklear, 2019).", "Another new measure, the EC scale, aims to assess the perception of ethics in an institution by its workers. Thus, in the fourth study, these two new scales were selected, adequately treated, and applied in Brazil. As a result, we analyzed idealism and relativism together with PD and EC, achieving the evaluat ion of persons and institutions, as well as their synergy points in order to develop an ethical approach.", "This survey made it possible to measure PD in a federal organization in the Brazilian public sector. It shows relevance since PD affects an organizat ion's production (Guay et al., 2016), and Brazilian public organizations offer below -average productivity (Laurinho, Dias & Mattos, 2017; Neto, Silva & Silva; 2017).", "Moreover, a high PD incidence is against the ethical conduct expected from public workers . Thus, our fourth study also aimed to cross idealis m and relativism levels with PD means. The analysis aimed to test conclusions that were widely reported in the previous literature: high idealism foment s more ethical postures, and high relativism lead s to the opposite.", "Finally, we also crossed ethical climate levels with PD means. Thus, this study aimed to assess the impact of individual ethical systems and ethical climate on PD means. We used MI to validate the possibility of comparing PD latent means between different groups (high idealism and low idealism, for example). The results revealed that high idealism and a strong perceived ethical climate are related to lower PD means. However, relativism did not show a clear relationship with PD.", "2 First Paper : \"Moral Philosophies i n Busine ss Ethics: a Bibliometric Analysis \"", "Abstract This study aims to understand the field of moral philosophies in business ethics, its most relevant subthemes, and its main metrics. In addition to the literature review, a bibliometric study is performed using the R ® software , aiming to offer information and quantitative analysis on the publicatio ns through content analysis . The field of research in moral philosophies is revealed, presenting its metrics and its main subthemes. Results show that research in moral philosophies addresses social issues with a collective bias, giving relevance to values , virtues, and behaviors. The rate of publications has been consistent in recent years, with a slight increase in quantitative research. Most papers have investigated the relationships between individual ethical system and behavioral elements. Th e informat ion helps improve national research to facilitate the comprehension of the ethical context in the national business environment. Keywords : Moral philosophy; business ethics; idealism; relativism; bibliometric.", "2.1 Introduction", "Interest in business ethics studies is relatively recent in relation to other academic management themes. Such interest began to gain strength in the 1970s; indeed, the first journals focused on th e theme only appeared in the 1980s, when it became part of the curriculum of American b usiness schools (George, 1987). Since then, a theoretical -academic field has developed, albeit mainly in the United States of America (Meira, 2010). Brazil and indeed Latin America as a whole have very few business ethics studies (Robertson, Olson, Gilley & Bao, 2008). However, the ethical inconsistency of managers (Moraes, Castro, Moritz & Lima, 2012) and demand for ethics in companies have been reported", "(Brito & Leone, 2012). Historically speaking, Brazil has a negative reputation concerning business ethi cs (Arruda, 1997; Halter, Arruda & Halter, 2009; Forte, Domingues & Oliveira, 2015) , which has grown with the advent of the recent corruption scandals triggered by operation Lava Jato (Cioccari, 2015).", "Undoubtedly, th e context confirms the relevance of bus iness ethics research in Brazil. Thus, we must study Brazil 's ethical context from its foundations: Brazilian individuals. One of the main objectives should be the expansion of studies on this topic. Without such expansion, it will be very difficult to build a robust diagnosis of the ethical problem that has been exposed with operation Lava Jato . Therefore, this article aims to prepare the field for filling this academic gap, increasing the volume of applied business ethics studies in Brazil. Followin g these ideas, the research is a review of the individual ethical system field, a relevant business ethics theme that is represented academically by moral philosophies. According to Monga (2005), moral philosophies are the ethical categories present in eac h individual, whose role is to guide individual ethical decisions. Hence , this study aims to form a comprehensive review capable of presenting the topic on various aspects, providing elements that allow a generic understanding of the field, its central con cepts, metrics , and variables most studied internationally .", "As a result, the article has three main parts: first, a literature review presents the theme of moral philosophies from its foundations, so that it can be appropriately understood and contextualized; second, an international bibliometric survey highlights the most relevant subjects, relationships, and concepts on the theme; and third, we map the quantitative researches on the topic, listing the studies based on the scales studied, to expose the main methodological paths for future national research.", "2.2 Litera ture R eview", "2.2.1 Moral and ethical concepts", "It is common to encounter the inaccurate use of the terms “ethics ” and “morals ” outside the academic environment. Pedro (2014) points out that the origin of the terminological flaws lies in the ignorance of each term 's conceptual details or in the option of using them similarly. Based on Greek and Latin translations, the author also states that these terms ' etymological origin favored an unclear understanding.", "The term “moral ” originally comes from the Latin term “mores, ” which means customs, in the sense of norms or rules acquired by habit. Therefore, it became a reference to indicate the rules of conduct admitted in a society (Figueiredo, 2008). From this origin, we understand that an accepted moral fact reflects society 's tradition or cultural reality. Vázquez (2014) points out that morality refers to a system of norms, principles, and values responsible for regulating individuals ' relationships in a social group. In this way, moral issues are present when relationship s between individuals occur, with a human conscience capable of choosing behavior consistent with the prescriptions of a social group. The author points out that morality is always located in time and space , varying over the years, also in the same society . Thus, a prevailing morality exists in every group . The prescriptions may change, but the fact that there is an existing moral does not change. No constituted social group can exist without the presence of a moral that guides it (Vázquez, 2014).", "However, unlike moral problems, which are more of a practical nature, applied in everyday life, ethical issues are distinguished by their generalities (Vázquez, 2014). The term “ethics, ” as we know it today, has its origin in the Greek term ethos and denotes “prope rty of character ” (Tugendhat, 2012). Despite the ambiguous historical use of the terms “ethics ” and “morals ” (Pedro, 2014), there is a reasonable consensus on the differences of each one. “Ethics ”", "assumes the role of a theoretical discipline (Srour, 2003), science, and theory of moral behavior in society (Vásquez, 2014). “Morals ” assumes the role of reproducing the correct action for each community (Vásquez, 2014).", "As theory, ethics has the function of explaining, clarifying, or investigating a given reality, elucidating the human moral experience and behavior (Vázquez, 2014). As science, ethics involves the historical social -moral background. Ethics seeks to determine the essence of morality, its origin, the condit ions of the moral act, the sources of moral assessment , the nature and function of moral judgments, and the criteria for justifying these judgments and principles (Vázquez, 2014).", "As a consequence , the object of ethical theory or science would be the “mora l world, ” which must be studied and understood from an objective, scientific approach (Vásquez, 2014). In this sense, ethics examines the nature of moral values and the authenticity of their use as a reference for individual or institutional actions (Figueiredo, 2008). Ethics can elucidate the principles that govern morals and even offer subsidies for its improvement. (Vázquez, 2014).", "2.2.2 Individual ethical system", "Fraedrich and Ferrell (1992) summarize that all morals refer to a set of values; these, in turn, result from a learning process initiated in the first years of human life. Usually, every child learns the basic rules of behavior and the values of their parents. When in maturity, the individual incorporates practices or actions of friends, teachers , and others, comparing them with their own experiences until an individual ethical pattern is defined. Therefore, the p rocess of assimilating moral rules is long and complex, and the person 's moral system becomes the basis for any personal ethical decision (Fraedrich & Ferrell, 1992).", "Besides, the process occurs due to several related moral conceptions, which underlie individuals ' actions (Forsyth, 1992). The scenario of multiple ethical principles in the same society results from the coexistence of different cultures and theoretical lines of ethics study (Vázquez, 2014) . Thus, the entire academic and philosophical field of ethics encompasses philosophers ' theories, often allowing a confrontation of ideas, rules, and interpretations, with divergent a ssessments of what is right or wrong, moral or immoral (Reidenbach & Robin, 1990). Based on this reflection, we find that there are different ways of interpreting and judging man's moral action s, not only in terms of the current mores in a given society bu t also in terms of the individual ethical systems built from ethical theories (Reynolds, 2006). In line with these findings, scholars sought to identify patterns of individual ethical systems present in the judgments and moral behaviors formulated by indiv iduals (Reidenbach & Robin, 1990; Forsyth, 1992; Monga, 2005; Reynolds, 2006; Al -Khatib, Vollmers & Liu, 2007; Tsahuridu, 2011; Wang & Calvano, 2015; Fok, Payne, & Corey, 2016; Clouse, Giacalone, Olsen & Patelli, 2017; Li, Chao, Chen & Zhang, 2018).", "These studies fit individuals into categories formed by the deepest values and constructs that underlie their ethical decisions. Such categories are identified from the principles, rules, and objectives that guide individuals ' decisions (Forsyth, 1992). They w ere named “moral philosophies,” based on traditional academic and historical moral perspectives (Al -Khatib et al., 2007), and allow the classification of individuals into concepts that reflect their ethical references.", "2.2.3 Moral philosophies", "The categories present several names, however maintaining the similarity of concepts . Business ethics studies of moral philosophies focus mainly on two paradigms: the deontological and the teleological approaches (Reynolds, 2006).", "2.2.4 Deontological approach", "The deontological moral philosophy presents itself as the most conservati ve and traditional. It is associated with the belief in universal values as imperatives. The deontological subject believes that moral rules are appreciated in their own right , regardle ss of the circumstances involved in the situations (Cranenburgh & Arenas, 2014).", "According to Hunt and Vitell (2006), in the process of deontological ethics, the individual evaluates the right or the wrong in each alternative found . The approach contrasts the options with the predetermined norms, as they represent society 's shared values. Deontological statements precede actions or intentions, defining an ethical or unethical attitude even before evaluating its consequences (Bowen, 2004). According to Cranenburgh and Arenas (2014), Kant 's categorical imperative (act only according to that maxim by which you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law ) presents itself as a classic illustration of a deontological vision.", "For that reaso n, people who behave based on this moral philosophy have precise positions on what it is to be honest or dishonest, so that these decisions are never contingent or conditional (Hunt & Vitell, 2006). Individuals guided by this moral philosophy follow the idea that they have duties to execute. They do not discuss contingencies but act based on what they previously defined as “the right thing” to do (Al -Khatib et al., 2007).", "2.2.5 Teleological approach", "Teleological moral philosophy is opposed to deontological. I t rejects any judgment that precedes the intentionality of the action and does not follow universal values for itself . The", "teleological approach judges the morality of an action given the consequences it presents (Cranenburgh & Arenas, 2014). Because of that, they are considered “consequentialist ”. It reflects the idea that if the result of the act is good, then the action is ethical. If the result is bad, the act ion is unethical (Bowen, 2004).", "2.2.6 Utilitarianism and individualism", "According to Be ekun, Westerman, and Barghouti (2005), teleological moral philosophy subdivides into individualistic and utilitarian conceptions, as the difference between them is in the subject beneficiary of the action or intention. Individualism is the teleological con ception that focuses on the good of the individual responsible for the action and only on himself. Utilitarianism focuses on the collective interest so that the decision -maker considers all the results of an action to choose the one which favors a greater number of people (Bowen, 2004). Thus, the utilitarian decision, whether for an individual, a company, or a government, is one that maximizes the good for a population (Cranenburgh & Arenas, 2014).", "2.2.7 Relativism and idealism", "Forsyth (1992) developed an analogous study of moral philosophies . He created four new categories by crossing two variables, idealism and relativism, that according to him, can be found in each individual 's ethical system. Idealism is a dimension that favors the understanding that th ere is always a “right thing to do. ” Idealistic people believe that hurting others is always preventable (Forsyth, 1992).", "Relativism is another dimension measured by Forsyth (1992) that influences an individual ethical system. This conception consists in the denial of the importance of universal", "norms . Thus, relativism is based on the argument that people have different opinions and experiences. There is no absolute principle, with each one having to develop and fix their own values .", "The taxonomy developed by Forsyth (1992) provides four types of personal moral philosophies, coming from t he crossing of idealism and relativism dimensions. As a result, individuals with a strong influence of the two dimensions are called “situationist s” and seek the best possi ble results for everyone in their decisions. Those with high idealism and low relativism compose the “absolutist” group, as they are strongly attached to moral rules. Individuals with low idealism and high relativism make up the “subjectivist” type; they r eject moral regulations and believe that ethical decisions must be made individually. Finally, those with the low influence of the two dimensions are called “exceptionalists” and believe that compliance with moral rules is desirable; however, it is not the criterion to be followed (Forsyth,", "2.3 Methodology", "This study is exploratory. It aims to have a broad view of the moral philosophy theme, its most studied subjects, the most prevalent methods, and its academic development . Thus, in addition to the li terature review, we used the bibliometric technique to collect thematic information from a sample of articles . We also gathered data about the number of publications by year and made a list of published studies th at used quantitative methods to measure moral philosophies.", "2.3.1 Bibliometrics", "The bibliometric approach applies tools to gather information. This technique is crucial to the field of information management and scientific knowledge among individuals, disciplines, and organizations (Guedes, 2012). Bibliometric s was developed in recent decades with the advent of software capable of processing bibliographic data, allowing the generation of objective information for more accurate knowledge of scientific production (Vanz & Stumpf, 2010). The field of bi bliometrics encompasses many techniques for different purposes of extracting information from texts or databases. This study, among other things, uses the content analysis method and does so through bibliometric procedures using the R® software. According to Alves (2011), content analysis is an investigation technique that uses methods to go through texts and extract meaning from them based on their terms. Therefore, it is possible to use bibliometric procedures to locate, process, and synthesize scientifi c production on a theme, counting words and generating numerical indicators that can be analyzed and interpreted (Bardin, 2011). For this purpose , we used Scopus® as a s earch engine for articles and R® software for processing text s.", "2.3.2 Sample", "Following the guidance of Vanz and Stumpf (2010), we used a bibliographic database to search for the articles to compose our sample . We chose the Scopus® database, produced by Elsevier® since 2004, to survey the literature. This database offers wide coverage of the scientific and technical literature (Vanz & Stumpf, 2010) and a comprehensive collection of peer-reviewed journals, representing academic production in areas associated with applied social sciences (e.g., Nobre & Tavares, 2017; Silveira, Petrini & Santos, 2016 ).", "We selected the main keywords for the search according to the literature. We used the root business ethic* associated with any of the other following r oots: moral philosoph*, ethical ideolog*, relativism*, deontolog*, utilitar*, teleolog *.", "As for the de limitation of years to be loaded on the Scopus® database, we used two criteria. The first criterion would be to define a period that, starting from the present towards the past, could offer a significant time frame, revealing the theme and its evolution. T he second criterion is operational and is related to the feasibility of the research. Given our limitations in assessing all documents , the number of articles should not exceed 150.", "Finally, after some tests, we identified that a sample with a delimitation of fifteen years would offer an optimum research horizon, attending at the same time our research objective and our capacity of reviewing each document. Hence , we limited our resear ch to articles in the Scopus® database between 200 4 and 2018, assembling fifteen years of research on the topic. Since we made the study in 2019, we decided not to include th e year in the studied sample, as it was not finished. In the end, after the exclus ion of some inappropriate documents (repeated, out of the scope, among other reasons ), the sample had 122 reviewed publications.", "2.3.3 Procedures", "All 122 articles were examined, confirmed within the research scope, and separated according to the research metho d and publication year . Besides, we prepared two graphs with publications per year and designed two tables with quantitative research articles about moral philosophies in business ethics. Finally, the articles were loaded into the R® software to perform content analysis , composing the frequency of word table and the word cloud. For the frequency of words, after some tests, we determined the frequency of appearance greater than 600 times as the cutoff factor of the terms, forming a group of the 15 most", "mentioned words.

We surveyed 410 Brazilian workers and used the Ethics Position Questionnaire (EPQ), with idealism and relativism scales (Forsyth, 1980). We translated, back -translated, and adapted the scales according to Sperber (2004) and conducted exploratory factor analyses together with confirmatory factor analyses to validate them . The results show that Brazilians present , on average, high idealism and low relativism. Therefore, Brazil appears to be a well-defined \"absolutist \" country compared to other nations , a surprising outcome, since Brazil ranks as one of the most corrupt countries on international scales. Brazil 's syste mic corruption ultimately confirms its complexity , as the nation show s high moral values and low ethics performance. Keywords: idealism; relativism; ethics position ; Brazil .", "3.1 Introduction", "Discussion about ethics in Brazil has gained relevance. \"Lava Jato, \" the famous national police operation, started in 2014, exposing old political and economic corruption schemes. These corruption scandals have affected Brazil 's external reputation (Gehrke , Borba & Ferreira, 2017). Since then, there has been a growing concern about internal corruption (Garcia & Teodósio, 2020).", "However, Brazilians have not studied the origins of these problems in depth. There has been little investigation and publication about business ethics in Brazil. All of Latin America has lagged behind the Western world in studies of those issues (Robertson, Olson, Gilley &", "Bao, 2008 ). Thus, one of our purposes is to contribute with knowledge that will help the country advance in understanding and reforming its ethical shortcomings.", "This study aims to address a theme of business ethics of central importance to a country: the ethical system of individuals . The objective is to reveal the predominant traits of Brazilians ' ethical systems that contribute to the country 's ethical diagnosis, especially in the organizational and business fields. Thus, public and private policies can work appropriately to contribute to an \"ethical evolution, \" and hopefully remove Brazil from the list of the world 's most corrupt countries (Transparency International, 2020).", "There are several methodologies available in the literature to analyze the individual ethical system. This article shortly presents three of them, and adopt s an internationally established method, thus allowing a comparison of Brazil 's results with those of other nations. The results of the application of the scale s in a survey of 410 Brazilian agency employees reveal the respondents ' ethical profile. The information allow s for comparisons between the idealism and relativism indices for Brazil and other countries.", "3.2 Literature Review", "3.2.1 Individual ethical system", "The mechanisms behind the principal personal ethical systems have been the focus of investigation by many scientists in the last two decades (Bialek & Neys, 2017). Fleischmann et al. (2020, p. 1) say that \"philosophy and early moral psychology often assumed that people arrive at moral decisions mainly through private internal processing – either through reasoning, intuition, or emotional reactions .\" Many authors have proposed individual ethical system models. We have sought to focus our analysis on the business ethics field, as we aim to", "study the organizations , and t hus, we present three ethical system visions , and choose one for our study.", "3.2.2 Moral philosophies", "In business ethics theories, Hunt and Vittel (1986) suggest that each individual, when faced with ethical content situations, acts based on rules and moral philosophies. Moral philosophies are ethical -philosophical categories developed throughout the history of philosophy. The two main ones are utilitarian philosophy, whose prominent exponent is John Stuart Mill, and deontological philosophy, proposed by Immanuel Kant (Byrd & Conway, 2019). The former judges the action 's ethical content according to its results and consequences. The latter stipulates a priori the ethical principles, regardless of the outcome s.", "Deriving out of these two main concepts , scholars have named other categories and identified them as moral philosophies, ethical ideologies, or ethical positions. These include rule utilitarianism (Bowen, 2004) ; Machiavellianism (Loe, Ferrell & Mansfield, 2000) ; relativism and idealism (Forsyth, 1992). Thus, academics such as Hunt and Vittel (1986) suggest that the individual ethical system operates as a reflection of these moral philosophies and that, i n general, follows the two main currents: utilitarian and deontological (Bowen, 2004).", "3.2.3 Ethical ideology", "Schlenker (2008 , p. 1079 ) proposes another analysis model of the individual ethical system: ethical ideology. He defines this as \"an integrated system of beliefs, values, standards, and self -images that define the individual 's orientation toward matters of right and wrong .\" This system would be responsible for providing a moral identity , moral schemas, and scripts", "for behavioral action. In this model, the factor that differentiates ethical decisions is the personal commitment to moral principles. Schlenker (2008) states that there are two ideological extremes between which the individual fits: principled ideology and expedient ideology. The former involves the idea that principles should guide conduct , regardless of its circumstantial consequences. The latter consists of the view that we should customize every principle to a context. It means that each circumstance can reveal an opportunity to act.", "3.2.4 Theory of Ethical Positions", "Forsyth (1980) developed a conception of an individual 's ethical system in his Theory of Ethical Positions. The author states that although there are several different and equally valid approaches , much of the personal ethical system distinguishes itself from the measurement of idealism and relativism.", "In general, idealism corresponds to concern for others ' well-being, a belie f that risks to their lives can always be avoided (Forsyth, 1992). Thus, idealism seeks to minimize the negative consequences of actions and maximize gains, especially concerning other people (Forsyth, O'Boyle & Mcdaniel, 2008).", "Diversely , relativism is based on skepticism, as universal principles are not considered valid for application in any situation and, thus, every action must be judged circumstantially (Forsyth, 1992). The measurement of relativism will vary according to whether the individual emphasizes principles as the necessary guidelines to moral action (Forsyth et al., 2008). The main research instrument of the Theory of Ethical Positions is the Ethics Position Questionnaire (EPQ) (Forsyth, 1980) . On a scale of 20 items, the EPQ allows the measurement of relativism (10 items) and idealism (10 items) dimensions.", "By measuring idealism and relativism, Forsyth (1980, 1992) builds a theoretical model capable of identifying four types of ethical positions that clarify the differences in individual moral judgments. Each ethical position reflects an integration of beliefs, attitudes, and values and can be identified according to the indic es of idealism and relativism measured in each subject .", "From the mean s or medians of idealism and relativism for a population, the researcher can place an individual between high or low idealism and high or low relativism. Thus, from this score, we position the subject in a comparative quadrant for their classification into one of the four ethical positions of Forsyth 's (1980) model. Table 2.1 presents the comparative quadrant.", "Table 2.1 Ethics positions Low Relativism High Relativism High Idealism Absolutists desire the best consequences and assume that these are always achieved when one follows the universal moral rules . Situationists reject moral rules but insist on seeking solutions that optimize the good for all. Thus, they seek the best results in each situation. Low Idealism Exceptionists feel that compliance with moral rules is desirable but are pragmatically open to exceptions to the rules. They do not believe that evil can always be avoided, nor that the well- being of all must always be preserved. Subjectivists reject moral rules and base their judgments in a particular way for each circumstance.", "Note: Adapted from Forsyth et al . (2008). Source: Forsyth, D. R., O 'boyle, E.

Because of their low idealism, subjectivists are less concerned with the positive consequences for other people and better accept risks. Due to their high relativism, subjectivists reject moral rules as guide lines to moral behavior. Thus, they tend to be egocentric in view of their goals and personal ethical judgments, which are not confused with universally accepted moral norms (Forsyth, 1992). These individuals draw a parallel with the \"individualistic \" moral philosophy. They are attached to particular objectives and seek them through specific means.", "3.2.4.3 Situationists", "\"Situationists \" are those with high idealism and high relativism. Because of their high idealism, they are concerned about others ' well-being , pursuing positive consequences for their actions. However, because of their high relativism, situationists do not believe that universal moral rules are the way to achieve this good, thus preferring the particular means applicable to each situation (Forsyth, 1992).", "3.2.4.4 Exceptionists", "\"Exceptionists \" are those with low idealism and low relativism. Because of their low relativism, exceptionists do not reject universal moral norms but tend to appreciate them.

The authors found studies from six countries with similar results. In these, the idealists disapproved of situations in which a buyer takes advantage of a supplier 's error that favors them . Otherwise, relativists were more lenient with this type of buyer behavior.

Notably, Brazil has not been recognized as a good business ethics model (Halter, Arruda & Halter, 2009; Forte, Domingues & Oliveira, 2015). That made r esearchers note a need to promote business ethics in Brazil 's academic and business environments (Brito & Leone, 2012). It reinforces the relevance of business ethics research in Latin American countries, especially those using EPQ methodology. Given this scenario, the translation, validation, and application of the EPQ as an ethics research instrument in Brazil show great relevance .

Besides being one of the most catholic countries in the world , Brazil has an increasing number of Protestant Christians (Guerriero, 2018).", "Christianity , with its social and collective approach es, is remarkable in teaching the practice of charity and fraternity. Simultaneously, Christian religions follow Judeo -Christian morality, basing themselves on the Bible 's Ten Commandments . In other words, Christianity advocates a deontolog ical moral, which affirms principles and belie fs, in a sense that those should be the correct guidance for Christian life.", "Thus, we presume that these religious influences manifest themselves in the individual ethical system of Brazilians. The charit able and collective sense should foster a more idealistic posture, given that idealism describes the intensity of concern for others ' welfare (Forsyth, 1992). On the other hand, the deontological emphasis of Christianity should favor a tendency contrary to relativism , since it describes the intensity of skepticism concerning moral rules Finally, also taking into account that religiosity was positively related to idealism and negatively related to relativism (Singhapakdi et al., 1999), we propose the following hypotheses:", "H1: The Brazilian sample presents an idealism mean above the international median (Forsyth et al., 2008).", "H2: The Brazilian sample presents a relativism mean below the international median (Forsyth et al., 2008).", "H3: The Brazilian sample classif ies Brazil as \"absolutist \" according to the criteria used by Forsyth et al.

Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA ) is based on previous research and works in the development of a proposed model (Lewis, 2017). This technique allows the specification and estimation of linear relations , and the constructs have scale items as indic ators (Hair et al., 2010).

The other option, the maximum", "likelihood estimation procedure (MLE), becomes very sensitive in samples with more than 200 cases and results in imperfect measurements of fit quality.

However, Brazil ranks 106th in the integrity index and is part of the group of the most corrupt countries in the world (Transparency International, 2020).

We expect that the results presented will contribute to further research that aims to unveil the ethical profile of Brazilians and explain their relations hips with culture, religion, traditions, and other Brazilian circumstances. Additionally , we expect business ethics in Brazil to be more widely appreciated and developed.

Thus, although we have made comparisons with scores from other countries, the international comparison results cannot be generalized . Another limitation is that the sample was composed exclusively of public employees. Indeed , there may be specific biases that we have not captured.

We used the Ethics Position Questionnaire (Forsyth, 1980) to survey 410 coworkers. Multi -Group Confirmatory Factor Analysis (MGCFA) was used to confirm the measurement invariance (MI) and to analyze latent mean differences. The results show no gender differences in idealism and relativism latent means. Some other peculiarities appeared when we analyzed the remaining five variables. The MGCFA revealed that, out of the six variables, idealism was only invariant in two analyses and that relativism was invariant in four. These results have many implications. Among other things, they show that several conclusions from previous EPQ demographic studies may be biased and do not reliably report the equivalences or differences between analysis groups.", "Keywords: idealism; relativism; measurement invariance ; demographic variables", "4.1 Introduction", "The Ethics Position Questionnaire (EPQ) has been used for decades, and several studies have examined demographic variations between groups. Nevertheless, most of these studies did not look at the measurement invariance (MI) of the constructs before compari ng the group means (e.g., Marques & Azevedo -Pereira, 2009; Oumlil & Balloun, 2009; Wang & Calvano,", "However, for the last 20 years, MI analysis has been recognized as an essential step for comparing groups using one psychometric instrument.

One reason for this is greater awareness by researchers that parameter estimates (latent factor means or structural coefficients) cannot reas onably be compared across groups when measures are noninvariant.\"", "Thus, although several studies have reached conclusions regarding demographic variations of idealism and relativism, it is well known today that many of these conclusions may have been skewed, given that the psychometric instrument MI was not evaluated among the studied groups. This study seeks to fill this gap. Therefore, we cho ose six demographic variables to perform MI analyses and to test mean differences when it proved to be free fr om bias.", "Thus, this research performed a survey with employees from a Brazilian organization, applying Forsyth 's scales of idealism and relativism (1980).

MGCFA, among other methods, enables us to find the MI of an instrument amongst samples and validates the comparison of a construct in groups before comparing their means (Sass, 2011). This analysis is particularly appropria te for latent mean comparisons between groups and is demonstrably more robust than others commonly implemented, such as the T -test, ANOVA, MANOVA, Mann -Whitney, and Kruskal -Wallis (Damásio, 2013).", "4.2 Literature Review", "4.2.1 Personal moral philosophies", "Personal moral philosophy refers to the specific characteristic that portrays how a person analyzes, thinks, and judges ethical content issues (Forsyth, 1992).

The analyses of these items showed th at factor loadings were lower in managers (0.307 for item 4 and 0.436 for item 5) than in non -managers (0.635 and 0.688, respectively). This comparison shows a lower correlation of these items with the idealism factor for managers (Hair et al., In addition, for a sample of 111 individuals, as is the case with the managers, this group 's factor loadings for items 4 and 5 do not present statistical significance, as they are below 0.5 (Hair et al., 2010). Thus, in a hypothetical EFA of the managers ' group, treated in an isolated way, these items could also be excluded from the factor. Besides, harming others or threatening their welfare is contrary to a fundamental characteristic of idealism because idealists believe that harming others can always be pr evented (Forsyth, 1992). In conclusion, even though we could not test H6a, the findings corroborate the primary idea of H6a that managers would present lower idealism scores than non -managers. As we see, the special care not to harm or threaten others is n ot categorically existent in the formation of the idealism from those in leadership positions.", "Finally, the MGCFA of relativism related to leadership position groups presented MI.

We found support for one hypothesis given the equivalence of latent means expected between men and women. The results show that r elativism proved to be a relatively stable construct in different sociodemographic groups. However, this same construct was noninvariant between the groups differentiated by level of education and career type, showing that these attributes can produce some relevant variation in their measurement when compared.", "As for idealism, out of the six analyses, only two presented MI, one in accordance with the literature (gender, H1a, supported) and the other contrary to our expectations (career type, H5a, not suppor ted). The latent means were equivalent in these two. Therefore, the validation of the construct was relatively sensitive to sociodemographic changes in four analyses (age, education, ethics training, and leadership position), revealing hints of each group 's differences in the construct measurement.", "Ultimately, we were able to test only half of the twelve hypotheses. In other words, if we had used a T-test or ANOVA, about six hypotheses would have been potentially biased. This observation reinforces the impo rtance of confirming the MI analysis before comparing latent means between groups, subject to the risk of obtaining biased final results in groups that measure a construct in a noninvariant form (Van de Schoot et al., 2012).", "Thus, we recommend that new com parative studies be carried out in organizations, using the MGCFA.

In order to study this relationship, we surveyed public sector employees from a Brazilian federal agency, using multi -group confi rmatory factor analysis to assess measurement invariance and compare groups. The results show that higher idealism is related to lower PD, and a higher ethical climate correlates with lower PD. However, we did not find a relationship between relativism sco res and PD.", "Keywords : production deviance, idealism, relativism, ethical climate, measurement invariance.", "5.1 Introduction", "Workplace deviance (WD) is a problem that leads organizations to lose billions of dollars annually due to productivity loss and other expenses (Bennett, Marasi, & Locklear, 2019). Scholars have sought to identify the probabilities of employee involvement in WD (Guay et al., 2016). Wang et al. (2020) state that it would be vital for companies t o identify the potential causes of WD because its effects are severe and undesirable. Production deviance (PD) is a dimension of WD (Stewart et al., 2009). It is related to employees ' waste of time, procrastination, and low commitment, which directly affec ts their productivity (Liu & Ding,", "Andrade (2020) affirms that the general population views Brazilian public servants as little-engaged, thus compromising efficiency in providing public services. The Brazilian public sector presents several ineffici encies, delivering a deficient level of service compared to the high costs of running it (e.g., Laurinho, Dias & Mattos, 2017; Neto, Silva & Silva; 2017). One of the reasons for inefficiency in organizations is WD, which remains a serious and widespread problem (Guay et al., 2016). Considering PD as a dimension of WD, this exploratory study examines the relationship between PD and other measurable constructs.", "Liu and Ding (2012) affirm that bad behavior predictors include personal factors and situational fa ctors. Dark and Rix (2015) state that the combination of organizational climate and the individual 's ethical system comprise the key variables influencing employee ethical conduct. Thus, we assessed the relationship between PD and two personal ethical dime nsions related to individual ethics positions: idealism and relativism. In addition , we studied the association between PD and the perception of organizational ethical climate. To this end, we surveyed the public sector employees from a Brazilian federal a gency.", "This study is relevant because of the importance of the topic it discusses and the information it can reveal. Researches have sought to understand the WD phenomenon (which includes PD) and its adverse monetary, psychological, and social costs (Mack ey et al., 2019). Any study that enhances the understanding of PD and its relationships can help the field advance and organizations to address the problem. Thus, we intend to understand ethical climate, idealism, and relativism in relation to PD, in hopes that PD can be better understood and treated by organizations, including the Brazilian public sector.", "5.2 Literature Review and Hypotheses", "5.2.1 Workplace deviance", "Workplace deviance (WD), also called counterproductive work behavior (CWB), characterizes employee behaviors that violate norms, affecting the organizations or their coworkers (Robinson and Bennett, 1995). In a measurement methodology, Bennett and Robinson (2000) divided WD into two dimensions: interpersonal deviance and organizational deviance. The fi rst reveals deviant acts directed toward individuals, while the second shows deviant acts that affect the institution. Interpersonal deviance includes behaviors such as making fun of another employee at work or verbally abusing a coworker. Organizational d eviance includes actions such as making personal phone calls during work hours or wasting company resources (Bennett et al., 2019).", "Many researchers have sought to understand WD and its causes and effects (Wang et al., 2020). Dalal (2005) found that job s atisfaction and organizational commitment have been negatively associated with WD. Bowling and Eschleman (2010) found that work stressors, such as organizational constraints and interpersonal conflict, were positively associated with WD. These authors also found that conscientiousness and agreeableness were negatively related to Darrat, Amyx, and Bennett (2017) confirmed that job satisfaction plays an important role in reducing WD. Qi, Liu, and Mao (2020) found that authoritarian leadership in Chinese contexts can positively trigger WD. Chernyak -Hai, Kim, and Tziner (2018) confirmed previous studies that found men are more likely to engage in WD than women. Pletzer, Oostrom, and Voelpel (2017) found that age wa s negatively correlated with WD. Finally, C hen et al. (2020) found that work -family conflict was positively associated with WD.", "5.2.2 Production deviance", "Investigating Bennett and Robinson 's (2000) WD scale, Stewart et al. (2009) found that the dimension organizational deviance could helpfully be seen as the combination of two factors, which they called property deviance and production deviance (PD). The first factor, which involves the misappropriation of property, includes the illegal removal of the organization 's material goo ds or financial resources. The second factor comprises deviations of human resources, such as wasting work time, procrastination, taking additional breaks, etc.", "5.2.3 Idealism and Relativism", "Forsyth (1980) created a methodology for capturing an individual 's ethics position by measuring two dimensions: idealism and relativism. The method includes the Ethics Position Questionnaire (EPQ), which is capable of measuring the incidence of these dimensions in individual consciousness.", "The idealism dimension refers to an individual 's inherent interest in others ' well-being (Clouse et al., 2017). According to Ismail and Rasheed (2019), the extremely idealistic individual assumes that desirable consequences can always be obtained with the \"right\" action. Thus, most ideal istic individuals believe that hurting others is always preventable, while the least idealistic individuals assume that hurting someone may be necessary to obtain another good (Everaert, Bouten, & Baele, 2019).", "The relativism dimension emphasizes the denyi ng of principles and norms as moral action guidelines (Forsyth, 2020). Individuals with high relativism reject universal moral rules, are skeptical, and tend to disregard moral rules in their decisions (Clouse et al., 2017). On the other hand, individuals with low relativism believe that moral rules should guide ethical decisions (Everaert et al., 2019).", "Several studies have examined the relationship between behavioral deviations and idealism and relativism. Among the most recent, idealism has confirmed its elf as a positive factor for the construction of ethical judgments (Ismail & Rasheed, 2019; Li, Chao, Chen, & Zhang, 2018) and ethical behavior (Ismail & Yuhanis, 2018), while relativism has shown the opposite in most cases. Clouse et al. (2017) identified a negative relationship between idealism and the acceptance of inappropriate financial practices, while relativism was positively related to the same behavior. Ahadzadeh, Wu, Ong, and Veeraiah (2020) described a high Machiavellianism association with a hi gh relativism score, in contrast, idealism showed the opposite association.", "Idealistic CEOs gave more relevance to Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) activities than non -idealistic CEOs (Everaert et al., 2019). Workers with high idealism were more incli ned to follow the rules and to socialize in the workplace, whereas workers with high relativism were more associated with the rejection of rules and were indifferent to socialization (McClaren & Vocino, 2017). Forsyth (2020) found a significant positive re lation between relativism and COVID -19 health mandates noncompliance. Idealism was related to the e thic of caring (White, Peirce, & Jacobowitz, 2019) and could significantly predict civic engagement attitude (Sunill & Verma, 2018).

H2: Individuals with high relativism present higher PD means.", "5.2.4 Ethical C limate", "Organizational climate consists of employees ' shared perceptions of their work environment (Zacher & Yang, 2016). The ethical climate is part of the organizational climate", "in those matters related to the experience of ethics in organizations (Ribeiro et al., 2016). The ethical climate comprises emplo yees' perceptions about the work climate regarding procedures, policies, and organizational practices with moral consequences (Martin & Cullen, 2006). Thus, the ethical climate represents the moral atmosphere and the ethics practiced in the organizations (Mulki & Lassk, 2019) and is formed according to the environment and the general context in which employees are inserted (Mayer et al., 2010).", "The ethical climate is considered the most manageable factor to encourage employees ' ethical behavior (Schwepker et al., 1997), influencing both decision -making and subsequent action in response to ethical dilemmas (Martin & Cullen, 2006). Some studies point to favorable factors associated with a positive ethical climate: employees ' perception of job meaningfulness (Mulki & Lassk, 2019); more significant commitment to providing superior customer value (Schwepker, 2017); better performance (Itani, Jaramillo & Chonko, 2017); better interaction between the worker and the supervisor (Schwepker, 2017); and lower turnover i ntention (Mulki & Lassk, 2019). The ethical climate was positively related to the growth of employee self - efficacy, generating ethical concerns in fulfilling work demands (Shacklock et al., 2011). Ghosh (2015) found a positive relationship between organiza tional citizenship and the ethical climate. A strong ethical climate is also related to a decrease in selfish and opportunistic behaviors (Tanner, Tanner & Wakefield, 2015), corruption (Gorsira et al., 2018), and behavioral deviations (Yi et al., 2012). Th us, we formulate the following hypothesis:", "H3: Individuals who perceive a high ethical climate present lower PD means.", "5.3 Methodology", "This research has exploratory characteristics. We sent a questionnaire to approximately 1,700 workers from a Brazilian fe deral entity. We eventually received 410 valid responses (Leys et al., 2018) , forming a satisfactory sample (MacCallum & Austin, 2000). The questionnaire included three scales, which we translated and adapted according to Sperber", "5.3.1 Measuring idealism and relativism", "Forsyth (1980) developed the Ethics Position Questionnaire (EPQ). It consists of 20 items: 10 for measuring idealism and 10 for measuring relativism. Idealism includes items such as \"one should never psychologically or physically h arm another person.\" Relativism includes items such as \"what is ethical varies from one situation and society to another.\" The items were assessed using the Likert -5 model. The responses generate scores ranging from 1 point (strongly disagree) to 5 points (strongly agree). Thus, we obtained the final construct 's mean for each person.", "5.3.2 Measuring ethical climate", "We measured the ethical climate using the scale of Schwepker et al. (1997). It consists of seven items and includes statements such as \"my company has policies with regard to ethical behavior.\" Responses were assessed in the Likert -5 model, ranging from 1 point (strongly disagree) to 5 points (strongly agree). Higher scores reflect a stronger perception of ethical climate.", "5.3.3 Measuring P roduction Deviance", "This research used the PD scale of Stewart et al. (2009), who, in turn, adapted it from Bennett and Robinson 's (2000) WD scale, adding and validating two new items in the PD dimension. With Bennett and Robinson 's (2000) WD scale, the answers were giv en in the self - reported model. In contrast, Stewart et al. (2009) used a non -self-reported model, meaning that a person reports a colleague 's behavior. These authors justify their change as follows:", "\"Further, deviant behaviors that individuals are unwilli ng to disclose on a self - report might be captured on a non -self-report measure. Self -protecting ego biases that can harm the accuracy of self -reports of workplace deviance are also much less likely to influence non -self-reports. In these respects, non -self- reports of deviance may be more accurate than self -reports .\" Stewart et al.", "Admittedly, self -report is susceptible to social desirability responding (Chan, 2009) and has been problematic in WD. Bin g et al. (2012, p. 29) affirmed: \"people may be reluctant to admit to negative attributes and behaviors .\" Berry et al. (2012, p. 614) wrote: \"unlike many variables in applied psychology, CWB involves highly sensitive inquiries about potentially self - incriminating information .\" Finally, Greco et a l. (2015, p. 76) also confirmed: \" the nature of CWB items influence people to underreport their engagement in CWB .\" Stewart et al. (2009) noted a problem, but their solution does not meet our study objectives because it only includes others ' reports. Howev er, Fisher (1993) proved that respondents project their evaluations when responding to indirect questions. The results of his research \" suggest that indirect questioning operates to mitigate social desirability bias and does not systematically affect the m eans of variables that are independent of social influence \" (Fisher, 1993, p. 307). Boddy (2005, p. 240) also stated : \"projective techniques are thus techniques that enable research participants or subjects to respond in ways in which they would otherwise not feel able to respond .\"", "Congruent with these ideas, we adapted the preface of the scale 's questionnaire to permit that every respondent could include themselves in their responses. With this change, we assumed that the reactions to the PD scale represe nted mainly the respondent 's PD. Following Zhuang and Tsang (2008), we used the third -person technique projection instead of directly asking ethically sensitive questions. Thus, instead of presenting PD items as \"other members of my organization,\" as Stewa rt et al. (2009) did, we introduced them just as \"members of my organization.\" For example, the first item became \"members of my organization put little effort into their work.\" This change aimed to stimulate the respondent to indirectly include themselves in the response, without being affected by social desirability. Following Fisher (1993), we assumed that each respondent indirectly projects their behavior into the phrase \"members of my organization,\" as they are, in fact, one of these members.", "Table 4.1 presents this adapted PD scale. Respondents assessed each item in the Likert - 5 model. The possible answers generate points, as follows: 1 (never), 2 (few times), 3 (monthly), 4 (weekly), and 5 (daily).

We then analyzed the constructs ' reliability in terms of internal consistency based on th e composite reliability index (Valentini & Damásio, 2016).", "5.3.5 Hypotheses testing", "We used the Multi -group Confirmatory Factor Analysis (MGCFA) to test the differences in PD latent means between the groups of low and high idealism, low and high relativism, an d low and high ethical climate. The MGCFA is a technique of structural equations of CFA that allows a researcher to evaluate the measurement invariance (MI) of a model in different groups. Thus, before assessing equivalences or differences in means between groups, it tests whether the psychometric instrument model is valid for both groups studied. Such analysis permits checking, among other things, if the factorial structure is similar between two groups, and if those items have equivalent factor loadings ( Damásio, 2013). Thus, the MGCFA proceeds with MI analysis. Cheung and Rensvold (2002, p. 233) recognize the importance of this methodology:", "\"Social science researchers are increasingly concerned with testing for measurement invariance; that is, determinin g if items used in survey -type instruments mean the same things to members of different groups. Measurement invariance is critically important when comparing groups. If measurement invariance cannot be established, then the finding of a between -group diffe rence cannot be unambiguously interpreted. One does", "not know if it is due to a true attitudinal difference or to different psychometric responses to the scale items.\"", "Therefore, only after confirming the MI is it possible to compare latent variable 's means between groups. Otherwise, we would discuss different models for different groups, comparing means previously biased (Byrne, 2010).", "For this reason, Damásio (2013) states that MGCFA is superior to other mean comparison tests (e.g., T -test, ANOVA, MANOVA, Mann -Whitney, Kruskal -Wallis). The problem is that when performing the standard comparison tests of means without first confirming the MI between groups, one can find results that do not correspond to reality since two groups may structurally measu re the same construct in different ways (Damásio, 2013). Thus, MGCFA carries out tests that evaluate MI before conducting the comparison of means. If the MI is not confirmed, the testing for latent mean differences cannot proceed. According to Damásio (201 3) and Byrne (2010), MGCFA comprises steps, as summarized in Table 4.2.", "Table 4.2 Steps of MGCFA", "Test Step To analyze Indicators Construct measure equivalence between two different groups 1st Configural invariance Invariance related to the configural model χ2/df, CFI, RMSEA 2nd Metric invariance Invariance related to the factor loadings Δχ2 p -value; ∆CFI 3rd Scalar invariance Intercepts level invariance Δχ2 p -value; ∆CFI (Milfont and Fischer, 2010) Means comparison 4th Latent means equivalence Latent mean differences between groups critical ratio (CR.)", "5.3.5.1 Division of groups", "One of the premises of the MGCFA is that the analysis can only be performed for comparisons between two groups (Byrne, 2010). Thus, we decided to divide the sample into groups based on the extreme results found in each construct before conducting the MGCFA to compare PD means between these groups. Therefore, after the initial results related to idealism, relativism, and ethical climate scores, we divided the sample into quartiles and considered the groups of extreme values to be used in the analyses.

Thus, we certified that the group with high idealism had a considerably lower PD latent mean than the low idealism group. In turn, the group with a high perception of the ethical climate also had a substantially lower PD latent mean than the group with a low perception of ethical climate. Finally, the difference in means between low and high relativism groups was not statistically significant and relevant. Thus, we rejected H2.", "5.5 Conclusion", "5.5.1 Idealism and P roduction Deviance", "A high idealism score has been related to a low unethical attitude (Ismail & Rasheed, 2019; Li et al., 2018; Ismail & Yuhanis, 2018; Clouse et al., 2017). Thus, to investigate whether a higher idealism me an would also be related to a lower PD mean, two groups with extreme responses concerning idealism values were separated in the sample (102 respondents in each). The first analysis of PD means showed that the high idealism group had a PD score of 0.36 lowe r than the low idealism group (2.82 and 3.18, respectively). However, the direct analysis of these PD scores could lead to biased conclusions if MI were not examined. (Damásio, 2013). Thus, we ran the complete MGCFA to compare PD latent means after we vali dated MI. This analysis confirmed that the high idealism group had a meaningful lower PD mean than the low idealism group, supporting H1.", "Consequently, this result confirmed the conclusions of several previous studies, in which idealism was directly relate d to more ethical behavior in the workplace. This information is important to organizations that seek to manage PD more efficiently, due to the losses and inefficiencies it causes (Guay et al., 2016). It may be especially true for the Brazilian public sector, which has a pronounced demand for increased efficiency in the management of human resources (Laurinho et al., 2017).", "5.5.2 Relativism and P roduction Deviance", "A high relativism score has been related to unethical attitudes (Ismail & Rasheed, 2019; Ismail & Yuhanis, 2018; Clouse et al., 2017). Therefore, H2 supposed that a higher relativism would correlate with higher PD means. However, the groups of low and high relativism presented a PD mean of 3.06 and 2.85, respectively. In other words, the most relativis t group showed the lowest PD mean, in opposition to what was supposed in H2.", "Hence, we opted to continue the MGCFA to check the PD MI between the groups and the possible differences of latent means, although in the opposite direction from what H2 stated. According to Table 4.6, the groups presented MI, and the difference in PD latent means was not significant. In this sense, groups of high and low relativism have equivalent rates of PD. This observation shows that, contrary to what could be predicted by the results of previous studies, relativism levels do not meaningful ly impact PD means. This result is relevant for organizations that seek to improve the selection of their employees and avoid high PD rates, including the public sector.", "5.5.3 Ethical C limate and Production Deviance", "A high perception of ethical climate has been directly related to positive behavior in the workplace (Mulki & Lassk, 2019; Schwepker, 2017; Itani et al., 2017; Tanner et al., 2015; Gorsira et al., 2018; Ghosh, 2015; Yi et al., 2012). T herefore, H3 supposed that a higher perception of ethical climate would be related to a lower PD mean. A first analysis of the means reveals that the group who perceived a high ethical climate had a PD mean of 2.45, whereas the group with a low ethical cli mate had a mean of 3.62, a difference of 1.17. The MGCFA confirmed the MI and the meaningful difference in latent means between the groups. Therefore, a high perception of an ethical climate was directly related to a lower PD mean, supporting H3. This resu lt is significant, among other reasons, because the ethical climate is an indicator that the organization can directly influence (Tanner et al., 2015). Thus, organizations that need to reduce the incidence of PD can implement policies that improve the ethi cal climate. Considering that PD is a source of inefficiency (Bennet et al., 2019), the finding also applies to the Brazilian public sector, which has a strong demand for improved efficiency in its workforce (Laurinho et al., 2017).", "5.6 Limitations and future s research", "This study has some limitations. The sample included only employees of a Brazilian federal entity. Thus, the results may contain specific biases from the Brazilian public service work environment.

We know that there will be corruption as long as there is a human being, but there are mechanisms for miti gating this phenomenon. However, whatever the path to improvement, it should start from an enlightened diagnosis of the problem.", "How could one make a diagnosis of a problem that until recently did not bother those who perish from it? With so much disregar d for it, the problem has always been left aside, being notoriously overlooked. Brazilian universities and centers of studies did not give due attention to the literary production on B usiness Ethics (BE) , and very few studies were developed on the theme ( Robertson et. al, 2008 ).", "This thesis sought to penetrate the BE field to favor the necessary diagnoses for a country that intends to move toward lower corruption levels. In this research, among other things, we find that the academic field of BE is broad and encompasses many subthemes. Therefore, we chose to deepen the individual ethical system 's theme among the many aspects we could study. Our goal was to know the roots of Brazilians' moral choices . Thus, we wanted to start our diagnoses from the individu al ethical issues so that it was possible to search for explanations for the problem as a whole.", "In order to comprehend the field of work and plan the development of our research, our first paper sought to understand the individual ethical system field in a broad and current way, focusing on the fifteen previous years of literary production. The bibliometric study allowed us, among other things, to identify the methodology of Forsyth (1980) as the most suitable for", "the studies of the individual ethical syst em of Brazilians. This research also allowed us to confirm the relevance of the ethical system field concerning other BE subthem es and we learned the importance of crossing demographic profiles with individual ethical characteristics . With this, the resear ch gaps and the relevance of making a diagnosis and developing the BE rese arch field in Brazil were confirmed.", "Thus, we identified the absence of studies that transla ted, adapted, and tested the Ethics Position Questionnaire in Brazil. Besides, we detected the absence of comparative data from Brazil in the meta -analysis performed by Forsyth et al. (2008). T he second paper aimed to fill this gap and found revealing results , since Brazil stands as a high idealism and low relativism country, being classif ied as \"absolutist.\" The results confirmed that the country 's Christian religious environment (Guerriero, 2008) may have influenced Brazilians ' predominant profile. However, it is surprising that, according to previous research (e.g. Park, Kang & Oh , 2018; Ismail & Yuhanis, 2018; Clouse et al., 2017) , this \"absolutist\" position would lead Brazilians to a high ethical standard, w ith low tolerance to corruption. But that is not what we see (TI, 2020). Thus, seeking to understand the ethical situation of the co untry in these variables, the best answer we found was given by Filgueiras (2009), who, in his research, concluded that:", "\"There is a practical willingness of the Brazilian to get involved in schemes of corruption, which contrasts with their moral configura tion. We (Brazilians) are able to mutually agree on certain moral values; yet we tolerate some corruption, because it refers to a cultural capital that renders corruption a latent, everyday occurrence, of an extremely flexible nature, and applicable in disparate situations.\" (pp. 416-417, our translation ).", "In other words, we confirmed Brazilians' great value, since they have strong principles and morally judge the situations in accordance with them. However, a historical and cultural legacy drive them to paradoxical ways of behaving. In this context, the unc onsciousness, the poor ethical education, and the ingrained customs hinder their ethical awakening .", "Thus, it is more than relevant to talk, discuss, and study ethics in Brazil. T he need for more mature research becomes even more acute in a BRICS state with high corruption rates . In this sense, the BE field should receive special attention, given the evident potential for corruption arising from the multiple economic transactions involving business. In the end, the diagnosis and solutio n of complex problems require much study. Although we are not sure yet how to tackle the problem, we are more than confident that it is necessary to expand our knowledge of it.", "6.2 Improving the knowledge and the use of the scales", "The third paper sought to collaborate with the improved use of EPQ scales. Thus, we aimed to refine the different incidences of individual ethical characteristics by demographic variables. Other authors have studied the cross -analysis of the Forsyth scales (1980) with different demo graphic variables (e.g., Marques & Azevedo -Pereira, 2009; Oumlil & Balloun, 2009; Wang & Calvano, 2015; Godos -Díez, Fernández -Gago, & Cabeza -García , 2015; Kour, 2017; White, Peirce & Jacobowitz , 2018).", "However, previous studies presented a methodological g ap. Our literature review ident ified that none of these researches validated the psychometric instrument 's measurement invariance ( MI) before comparing groups separated by demographic variables. When this happens, we cannot know if the groups ' differences or similarities correspond to reality because the groups may be measuring the same construct differently. Therefore, the comparisons between them would be biased (Damásio, 2013).", "Our study found some peculiar results in the twelve analyses don e (six for idealism an d six for relativism). We focus on the final summary that outlines idealism and relativism scales ' ability to work without variation in different demographic groups. In this sense, the relativism", "construct was more stable, presenting MI in four of the six analyses (age, gender, ethics training, and leadership position). In evaluating the career type and education groups, relativism did not prove MI, which implied the impossibility of comparing these groups without ensuring that the conclusions would be biased.", "The idealism constructs only presented MI in two of the six analyses (career type and gender). Therefore, in the analyses of age, education, ethics training, and leadership position, the construct of idealism did not prove MI. Thu s, it was not possible to compare the results of the groups. It generated some concern about the scale 's adequac y to run idealism comparisons between different populations. We understand that new research will be necessary to confirm these results.", "Finall y, in our last study, we sought to test idealism and relativism against the production deviance ( PD) scale. The test served as a parameter to analyze the relationship between idealism and relativism with inadequate work behavior. The PD scale was chosen be cause of its direct impact on organizations ' productivity, raising an essential issue for Brazilian public organizations ( Laurinho et al., 2017; Neto et al., 2017 ). In addition, we have also inserted PD analyses concerning the ethical climate ( EC), which a llowed us to aggregate new relevant information to organizations ' ethical management.", "The results were in line with the conclusions that the literature had previously pointed out: a high idealism score has been related to a minor unethical attitude (Ismail & Rasheed, 2019; Li, Chao, Chen & Zhang , 2018; Ismail & Yuhanis, 2018; Clouse, Giacalone, Olsen & Patelli , 2017). Thus, high idealism was related to a lower PD mean. Such a result is even more relevant now that this thesis makes the idealism scale availab le in Portuguese to be used by Brazilian organizations in order to help them decrease their PD indices. EC analysis also followed the line of the conclusions that the previous literature pointed out: a high perception of ethical climate has been directly related to positive behavior in the", "workplace (Mulki & Lassk, 2019; Schwepker, 2017; Itani, Jaramillo & C honko , 2017; Tanner, Tanner & Wakefield, 2015; Gorsira, Steg, Denkers & Huisman, 2018; Ghosh, 2015; Yi, Dubinsky & Lim, 2012). Therefore, workers who perceive a high ethical climate had a lower PD mean. Considering that EC is an indicator that can be direc tly influenced by management (Tanner et al., 2015), this result is relevant to organizations that desire to lower PD incidence. Finally, the relativism analysis results did not confirm what the literature had pointed out (Ismail & Rasheed, 2019; Ismail & Y uhanis, 2018; Clouse et al., 2017). Thus, the level of relativism did not significantly influence PD means.", "6.3 Summary of c ontributions", "The search for answers led us to investigate the appropriate scales for the intended research purposes (first paper). After finding the proper methodology, the next step was to compare Brazilian data with other nations ' data (second paper). After that, we worked to scrutinize the applied scale resul ts, seeking to understand them according to different demographic groups (third paper). Finally, with these data, we advanced the research toward a comparative study that could reveal Brazilians ' behavioral biases from the ir ethical positions (fourth paper ). Considering this path of research , we summarize our outputs in three main lines. First, w e went deep in the discovery of ethics positions field and in finding specific diagnostic information of national int erest. These results can foster the development of policies looking for reducing Brazilian business ' corruption rates.", "Second, f rom the first to the last paper, this research built a path in which we chose, adapted, and tested some to ols for studying BE in Brazil. In doing this, we have contributed to the improvement of using proper methods for ethical research on national territory. Thus, w e made the Brazilian final version of the scales available in the survey questionnaire (a ppendix ).", "Third, we underline t he scientific contribution of the results fo und, provoking BE's field development. We tested the MI of idealism and relativism in relation to six demographic variables and found the equivalence or nonequivalence of these construct means according to different populations. Besides, we checked the rel ation of idealism and relativism with PD, and the relation of EC and PD, also bringing new information that helps organizations to manage their workforce and their ethical policies.", "6.4 Limitations", "This thesis presents several methodological limitations. In the first paper , the sample studied was composed of publications from the Scopus® database, ranging a period of 15 years. Hence, this research reveals a limited extent of information. Besides, the conclusions that we offered were subjective and do not represent all possible interpretation s of the results. In addition, from the second to the last paper, other limitations appeared. First, we surveyed a Brazilian organization. The sample was formed with public servants from a Brazilian federal entity. Thus, the results may contain specific biases from the Brazilian public service work environment or from the entity surveyed, and the sample used cannot be considered representative of Brazil. Therefore, the results are not subject to generalization.

Besides, it is necessary to investigate if the patterns observed in our research will also be present on employees or companies from the private sector. It also would be possible to compare results from public and private sectors in order to verify whether there a re ethical position differences between these two environments. In addition, the results of the third paper are not conclusive, and other studies testing the MI of idealism and relativism in relation to demographic variables could helpfully be performed. Finally, in view of the new pandemic scenario, we recommend that a new line of research could start to investigate employees' behavior concerning compliance to health mandates, in order to preserve their colleagues and their vulnerable relatives.", "8 Appendix: Research Questionnaire", "Prezado(a) servidor(a),", "Este formulário faz parte de uma pesquisa de Ética nas Organizações que está sendo realizada na sua Organização.", "A sua participação é importante e será fundamental para uma maior compreensão do contexto ético no Brasil.

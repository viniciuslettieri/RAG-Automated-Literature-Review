Among them, the excessive use of digital devices, causing dependencies due to the non -conscious use of them. The collective environments of Organizations, regardless of their nature, begin to show symptoms of such dependencies. Based on the hypothesis that there are characteristic behaviors in these environments, regarding the existence of collective digital dependence among work teams, investigations into this dynamic are justified. The general objective of this thesis was to investigate the existence of characteristic behaviors of Digital Dependence in Organizations, from the perspective of employees and, from the perspective of leaders. As a method, cross -sectional research for scale validation and discussion of results were carried out , as well as literature reviews to give theoretical support to these studies. The results of the wide publication (8 articles as author and 11 as co -author), in addition to 5 articles in submission and another 5 under construction, showed the existence of severe digital dependence in employees (12%), moderate (19%), mild (37 %) and without dependence (31%). An exponential growth of the topic was observed worldwide, with an increase in scales (300%), of countries researching on the topic (300%), of articles and citations (320%), in the last ten years. The limitations of the topic such as originality, little knowledge of leaders and employees about digital dependence, limited number of academic journals, among others, did not prevent the achievement of the obj ectives and the confirmation of the hypothesis that there is behavior of collective digital dependence in organizational environments.", "Keywords: digital addiction; collective digital dependence; digital dependence in Organizations; digital dependence on em ployees; conscious use of technologies", "Rio de Janeiro", "vii", "Sumario", "4.8.1.

Nomofobia3 is the irrational fear of being without your mobile phone or being unable to use it for some reason, such as the absence of a signal or running out of minutes or battery power. Together with digital amnesia, attention deficit, digital dementia, abusive use of social networks, compromised vision, among other dysfunctions, nomophobia is one of the examples that fit into the context of digital dependence.1 In the mid -1990s, the first study on human internet dependence4 emerged. From then on, this theme began to surface at an ever increasing rate: at the time of writing, with the evolution of technology and especially with the mobility factor, new technological digital resources continuously crop up, transforming human be havior in decisive ways. This transformation obviously includes abusive use5,6 which may cause harmful effects on health. Care is needed to minimize physical, psychological and behavioral damages.7,8", "Apart from internet dependence as previously studied, the dependence on social networks and communication devices has also been researched.9 Behavioral and psychological changes, related to abusive and uncontrolled use, create s evere impacts on users’ lives.10 The expansion of the Digital Age1 extrapolated dependence at an individual level and is now, typically, a social phenomenon, given its collective and broad characteristic, capable of influencing organizational environments, hitherto not contemplated.1 Employee abusive, indiscriminate and prolonged use in the workplace may be detrimental to individual performance as well as to the collective organizational results. In addition, and because a large part of collective human behavior interferes with, and is modified by organizational culture, individual digital habits in organizations may feedback as an influence the culture and destination of organizations. Culture is as influential in human behavior and consequently in organizations as it is invisible; discussing it is more difficult than mapping it or than subsequently analyzing its profile. Because of its invisibility and apparent ethereal state, however paradoxical this may sound, it is solid enough to re -forge organi zational profiles.11 Consequently, we consider it vital to investigate, the occurrence of such phenomena in the collective environment of organizations, using a validated instrument.", "The purpose of this paper was thus to validate a digital dependence evalu ation scale, built specifically for application to employees who do not hold leadership positions in organizations.", "MATERIALS AND METHOD We performed a search for scales on digital dependence within organizational environments that might have subsidized the construction and validation of what we required. The keywords used in the search were: digital dependence in organizations; digital dependence in companies and digital dependence of employees. To the best of our knowledge, the topic had no precedent and thus the prospect of success with findings at the organizational level tended to zero. Unsurprisingly, the search found nothing possessing any minimally useful properties. Consequently, in developing our scale, no data restrictions were placed on including any possible valid content. Also, and for these same reasons, the nationalities of participating content authors was left open. According to Hair et al12 no questionnaire should be administered before the researcher has evaluated the expected accuracy and consistency of the answers. Such a pilot test allows us to previously evaluate the questionnaire and then submit it to specialists who are knowledgeable about the theme.1 Thus, a first version (with 20 questions) was built collectively by 6 specialists and subjected to a new evaluation, as described below. In this new evaluation, carried out by 6 different specialists, the clarity, objectivity and focus of the 20 questions were examined. A final version of the scale was obtained and applied t o 301 volunteers, men and women, aged 18 - 65 years; seven answered questionnaires were discarded, on account of faulty completion, resulting in an effective sample of 294 participants. The data collection procedure was performed electronically, through a computational resource often used in academic circles for investigations of this nature.", "The scale was applied online, being made available for 30 days to a target audience made up of employees, who did not hold leadership positions of a Brazilian state - owned company included in the segment of Information Technology and Communication.", "The 20 DDES questions offered the responder the following options: Never/Rarely (0 points), Frequently (1 point) and Always (2 points). Consequently, total points obtained from each responder ranged from 0 to 40. After data collection, a database was set up to permit the performance of statistical analysis leading to scale validation, as well as to identify the profile of the sample from the demographic point of view. Statistical validation was made up of descriptive statistics, factorial analysis, factorial loads and internal consistency, using the R computer program, version 3.4.2.13 The resulting sum obtained classified the volunteers in the following categories: 0 to 8 (without disturbances); 9 to 18 (mild disorders); 19 to 28 (moderate); 29 to 38 (severe). Demographic data were only used for demographic identification of participants and recorded age group; educational level and gender.", "The construction of the DDES scale was specifically aimed to make it as short as possible in terms of the number of items within the scope of the theme, without unusual words, without embarrassing assertions, without implication of subordination. None of these precaution impacted the objectives of the collection instrument. Once validated by specialists, DDES was applied to employees.", "Inclusion criteria. All employees of the company (analysts and technicians) were invited to voluntarily participate in the research and were instructed about its objectives.

As noted in “Methods”, this information was collected merely for information purposes and did not interfere with the project’s objectives. In terms of educational level, there is no perceptible difference between the groups, except for the four volunteers with a doctoral degree, which makes it not significant for mean tests. Factorial Analysis .14 The first test was the Bartlett Sphericity test,15 to verify if the questions correlated with each other, which would ensure the consistency of the set of items. In this test, the null hypothesis is that a correlation matrix is equal to the identity matrix. Factor analysis is feasible because the value found produced p <0.001, indicating a strong correlation between the questions. The next criterion was the Kaiser -Meyer -Olkin Criterion or KMO,15 to verify the adequacy of the factor analysis A value 0.754. was found, Previous reports diverge, MedicalExpress (São Paulo, online) 2019;6: mo19002", "some regarding 0.7 as good15, while others claim that values above 0.8 is more appropriate16.", "Table 2 shows the Measure Sampling Adequacy indices for each of the questions, where five questions obtained values greater than 0.8, ten between 0.7 - 0.8, two with values bordering 0.7 and one in the vicinity of 0.5. Results found for Bartlett and KMO showed it to be appropriate to perform the factorial analysis for the questionnaire.", "Factorial loads. The next step was to verify the factor loads to determine the number of relevant factors, using 3 criteria: Factorial Load, Screeplot and Parallel Analysis.", "Factorial Load Criterion. It is advisable 15 to use factorial loads whose sums result in a value above 0.9, and, worst scenario, above 0.8. However, for this data set, we would need at least 14 factors, which would not solve our data reduction data (Table 3).", "We then proceeded to the Screeplot criterion of the correlation matrix, where factors related to Eigenvalues > 1 were eliminated.", "Screeplot Criterion. By this criterion, 7 factors must be used, and in this case, the commonalities of the variables are presented in table 4:", "Analyzing the commonalities, we found that only question #7 (highlighted in bold type) has a value below 0.5, which is considered low16; this led to the exclusion of the question. The deleted question read:", "” How often you ignore labor aspects concerning the use of personal communications devices of your co-workers or other employees of the company, for professional activities?” Parallel Analysis Criterion .16 By this criterion, 3 factors were found, according to the commonalities displayed in Table 5. The problem encountered when using Parallel Analysis was that most of the commonalities were very low, with only questions 13 and 15 reaching the minimum value of 0.5. We therefore adopted the Commonalities through Screeplot which allowed the confirmation of all but question", "Validation of Digital Dependence Employees Scale Gonçalves LL MedicalExpress (São Paulo, online) 2019;6: mo19002 Internal Consistency through the Cronbach Alpha Coefficient. The last step was to calculate the Cronbach Alpha Coefficient 17,18 in order to measure the internal consistency of the questionnaire. The value found was 0.764, which is considered acceptable12 and shows consistency between the items of the questionnaire.", "DISCUSSION Digital dependence has grown within organizations, usually undetected by its leaders, who were caught unprepared to identify and understand the effects of this phenomenon; unfortunately, it interferes with human behavior, organizational environment and consequently with culture, performance and expected results.1 King et al19 reported that personal, social, academic and professional life is compromised because of abusive use and/or dependence on digital technologies in daily life. Research on this phenomenon must be expanded within the collective environments of organizations to make data more consistent. In addition, such research may guide and direct the actions of its leaders toward a better coexistence with their teams. Team members with digital dependence can present variable characteristics, according to the various organizational profiles.", "Digital dependence has a global collective dimension encompassing communities, organizations, cities and nations. Thus, dependence becomes a social fact, because of the universality of its amplitude; in plain English, digital dependence transforms entire communities and their cultures. It is thus totally justifiable to construct an instrument, such as the herein described Digital Dependence of Employees Scale, that may become the objective basis of research on digital employee dependence within organizations. We are convinced that DDES collected a satisfactory data set considering the number of questions created in the initial scale.", "Completed questionnaires showed a high concentration of low scores. Strictly speaking this may mean that our volunteers see themselves in a condition of light digital dependence. This perception is not surprising because, in general, digital addicts do not think themselves to be addicts and tend to answer questions at lower (instead of true) degrees of dependence. It should also be understood that our volunteers are employed in a digital technology company, where all things digital are perceived as natural, making it even more difficult to see oneself as a digital dependent person.", "Demographic data showed a well distributed frequency, revealing consistent degrees of comprehension for the items in the scale, as well as a good frequency distribution by age group of participants, especially in the 31-40, 41 -50 and 51 -60 bands. No single age band predominates, avoiding an embarrassing research bias. With more of these surveys using DDES it may become possible to observe behaviors correlated with age band concentration, revealing new contributions of the scale. Factor analysis could be performed due to the low p-value in Bartlett’s sphericity test, indicating that there is a correlation between the questions. In addition, the KMO criterion ratified the adequacy of the factorial analysis, because 15 of the 20 items of the scale had values > 0.7, which is satisfactory. Four items ranged slightly below 0.7, while one was at the level of 0.5; taken together, this a very good result for a 20-item questionnaire.", "Three criteria were used to choose the number of factors: Factorial Load, Screeplot and Parallel Analysis, with the number of factors being respectively 14, 7 and 3. The number of factors chosen was 7 of the Screeplot, because with 14 there would be too many factors to be worked out and with 3, too many questions would have to be eliminated because of lower commonalities. With the adopted factoring, only one variable or question was withdrawn from the scale because it was the only one with a commonality < 0.5. Thus, the final scale has 19 questions, as shown Annex 1. The internal consistency extracted by Cronbach’s Alpha17,18 presented a value of 0.764; this ratifies the alignment between the scale questions, since values above 0.7 are considered valid.", "This study has minor limitations. The theme is a total novelty, and this means that authorization of application within in their organization came from managers/directors who knew next to nothing about the theme. Then, when it comes to application in an organizational environment, the volunteers must have had a measure of mistrust about what would be done with their answers, even though they had been told that the data would be treated collectively. This was aggravated by the fact that the application was performed online, which prevents the researcher observing the volunteers’ actions/reactions while completing the form. In spite of all this, it was possible to manage effectively the coordination of the organization that served as a research field, with efficient and attentive monitoring of these aspects. Another limitation of the study was the lack of other instruments similar to the objectives of this research that could subsidize the construction of the present scale.", "CONCLUSION The validation of the DDES scale was completed, resulting in a scale that meets the objective of evaluating digital dependence of employees in an organizational environment. We consider it important to construct an unprecedented and specific instrument such as this to support future scientific research in the field of digital dependence of employees in the collective milieu of organizations. The growth of this theme and its possible interference with organizational culture, human behavior and operation of the organizations justifies this work. MedicalExpress (São Paulo, online) 2019;6: mo19002 New research will reinforce the validity of this scale and may allow comparisons between results produced by employees of companies of different natures through the dynamics of digital technology usage.", "AUTHOR CONTRIBUTION LL Gonçalves: reviewed the literature, applied the scales and wrote the present article.", "AE Nardi: co-oriented and wrote this article.

Nomophobia3 is an example of digital addiction, as well as digital amnesia, attention deficit disorder (ADD), digital dementia, abusive use of social networks, and committed vision among other dysfunctions.1 Recent literature has explored the process of global change associated with social, technological, and timesaving relationships, as well as the relation of time of entry and exit. Thus, social practices are changing and new ones are being created due to technologies.4 The mobility factor, materialized by the integration of the internet and cell phones, contributes to greater digital use, transforming human behavior. This transformation derives from abusive use5 that can have harmful effects on health, requiring care to minimize physical, psychological, and behavioral damages.6,7 The negative impacts of these changes are caused by the abusive use of the Internet, affecting quality and performance in work and academic achievement, family life, social relations, physical health, and psychological well -being.8 Internet addiction represents a global health issue. Efforts have been made to characterize risk factors for the development of this dependence and the consequences of excessive use of the Internet. This feature has dramatically changed the way we live, and we find our way into unfamiliar territory, communicating effectively with our friends, facilitating professional communications, and promoting collaborative science with investigations around the world.9 In addition to Internet dependence as it has been originally studied, dependence on social networks and communication applications has also been researched.10 Behavioral and psychological changes are related to abusive and uncontrolled use, which have severe impacts on users' lives.11 The expansion of the digital age1 extrapolated this dependency at the individual level into a social phenomenon given its collective and broad characteristic and even influenced organizational environments, hitherto not contemplated.1 Employees' abusive, indiscriminate use in work environments may be detrimental to quality of life (QOL), individual performance, and collective organizational outcomes. In this scenario, leaders need to understand this phenomenon and work towards preserving QOL in the workplace. Checking emails at work after hours, logging into social networks or personal emails while working, and increasing connectivity particularly with the proliferation of handheld devices can have negative consequences in personal and professional d omains. Distinctions between work and leisure, public and private, here and there are rapidly disappearing, while the stress reported as caused by the abusive use of technology seems to be growing.12 The hypothesis is that abusive use of digital technologies in organizations can lead to the establishment of digital addiction. Thus, leaders need to identify this phenomenon. To do this, it is necessary to measure these events in human behavior using a specific validated scale. This work aimed to validate the scale to evaluate the perception of leaders on digital employee dependence (EPLDDE) built specifically for application among people holding positions of leadership in organizations. The recognition of this dependency among its employees can help an organization take action to preserve or increase QOL at work.", "Methods No digital addiction scales were found in organizations that could subsidize the construction of this scale. Due to the novelty of the theme, which leads to the production of new knowledge, no restriction was placed on the date of the valid contents or on the nationalities of the authors of the contents to be investigated. The keywords used in the search were digital addiction in organizations digital addiction on companies, digital addiction in employees, perception of leaders about digital addiction. Initially, different situations that could characterize digital addiction in organizations such as excessive use of particular mobile devices were related by digital addiction specialists of the Delete - Conscious Use of Technologies group, Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (IPUB/UFRJ). Motivation due to organization rules on use of mobile devices, which limited internet access, affected interpersonal relationships and affected organizational outcome. Then, items related to these situations were described through phrases that could reflect the mentioned behaviors reported in the literature as well as in the interviews conducted with potential digital dependents by the Delete Nucleus. This stage was aimed at apprehending people's perceptions of digital dependency and how it occurs in practice in organizations.", "A first version (20 questions) was constructed in scale format with items in the interrogative form, with multiple choice questions scored on a 3-point scale ranging from 0 to 2 [Never/Rarely (0), Often (1), and Always (2)].", "The elaborated items were tested to verify the semantic understanding and the scale was presented to 10 people with a profile analogous to the target audience. They were instructed to carefully read each item and try to identify comprehension difficulties.

After the semantic comprehension tests, the consistency of the questions was evaluated by a group of 6 judges, teachers, and doctors who examined clarity, objectivity, and focus of the questions in terms of the research objectives. The judges had to reach an agreement on eac h item or change it. The contributions of these judges were evaluated one by one, with no face -to-face debate, and the criterion of at least 80% agreement between these judges was adopted, concluding with the withdrawal of 3 questions, and thus, resulting in a scale of 17 questions.", "The target audience consisted of 786 heads (departments, managers division, sector, and coordination) of the Brazilian state -owned company of Information and Communication Technology.

Thus, it is justifiable to construct an instrument, such as the EPLDDE scale, that can assess the degree of digital addiction in organizations.", "Demographic data showed a good frequency, revealing consistent degrees of comprehension for the items in the scale, as well as a good frequency distribution by age group of participants, especially in the age Satisfactory variabilit y that minimizes the tendency of only one predominant group creates research bias.", "The factorial analysis was performed due to the low P-value in Bartlett's sphericity test, indicating a correlation between the variables.

The only item below 0.7 showed a value of 0.675, so very close to 0.7 that it signifies a good result.13 In the second factor analysis in the questionnaire with 14 questions, both Bartlett’s test and the KMO indicated the accomplishment of said analysis.14 Three criteria were used to choose the number of factors in the first factorial analysis, factorial load, screeplot, and parallel analysis, with a more appropriate number of factors (screeplot with 5). In the second factorial analysis, the 5 factors and 14 issues were maintained.", "Only question 5 presented a commonality below 0.500 (0.489), highlighted in table 4. It is not a satisfactory result, but this question is very important for the research objectives, and thus, is kept in the questionnaire.", "The internal consistency was evaluated using Cronbach's alpha,17 which presented a value of 0.8131717 that ratifies the alignment between the scale questions, since values above 0.7 are considered valid, thus, reinforcing the adequacy of the scale. The Cronbach's alpha of each of the 5 factors was also extracted, with the expectation that they were smaller than the general one, due to the small number of questions for each factor. In this way, factors 1 and 3 (0.79 and 0.77) reached the level of 0.7, which is considered satisfactory, while factors 2, 4, and 5 had a value of 0.53, 0.61, and 0.57, respectively. These internal consistency values should be improved through reviewing each of the items or questions, although Cronbach's alpha for the overall questionnaire with 14 questions was good. Among the limitations, which did not affect the achievement of the objectives, the novelty of the theme stands out. Bosses, being also employed, even knowing that the data would be treated collectively, may be mistrustful about the fate of their answers. The online application prevents a reading of the reactions of the volunteers during responding. In spite of all this, effective and efficient management was possible through the coordination of the organization that served as research field. Conclusion After the judicious process of constructing the scale based on the knowledge about digital dependence and the analyses of semantic comprehension and consistency of the items based on judges’ views, the data generated from the application of the scale in a final sample of 312 leaders were analyzed statistically. Two factorial analyses determined the finalization with 14 questions, validating the EPLDDE scale for the evaluation of leaders' perceptions about the digital dependence of employees in organizations. It is important to build a specific instrument such as this to meet the needs of future scientific research in the field of organizational digital addiction because the growth of this theme and its interference in organizational culture, human behavior, and the operation of organizations justifies this endeavor.", "It is necessary to expand investigations on this phenomenon to make the data more consistent, allow comparisons between organizations researched, and to support the leaders' performance in the better coexistence of their teams with digital dependence, which may present different characteristics according to the various groups of organizational profiles.

Organizational collective environments already have symptoms of these dependences. Objective: To evaluate, in an unusual way, the digital dependence of employees, the perception of leaders regarding employee dependence and to compare re sults between the two groups. Method: Volunteers were informed about the scope of the research. On line data collection started between 03/01 and 04/15/19. The sample had 330 employees with no management positions that answered to the Digital Employee Dependence Scale – EDDE and 96 with leadership positions that answered to the Scale to Evaluate Leaders’ Perception of Digital Dependence Employees - EPLDDE, generating two databases for the analysis. Results: Presented separately, employee and leaders, with percentage by option of answers that indicate low perception of the volunteers on the subject. Convergences and divergences between leaders and employees reinforce possibles unevennesses of knowledge about this subject. Discussion: Three blocks: (a) EDDE; (b) EPLDDE;(c) comparative EDDE x EPLDDE. Highlighting of the convergences and divergences between visions of leaders and employees on similar questions signaling the need for analysis of these differentiated perceptions. Conclusion: There is no general concern of leaders and employees about digital dependence in the organization, although there are signs of existence. There are divergences between them about various elementary aspects of this theme. It is necessary guide them on the characteristics of digital dependence to better understand and correct their digital practices. *Corresponding author Lucio Lage Gonçalves, Vice Presidente José Alencar, 1500, block 1, apt 1004 Barra da Tijuca - Rio de Janeiro / RJ - CEP 22775 – 033.", "Delete - Conscious Use of Technologies, Institute of Psychiatry (IPUB).

It includes manifestations such as alienation, anxiety, fear and insecurity, preventing theindividual from performing his or her activities normally, and may also interfere in the group of people living with them, such as family, work and other groups. Nomofobia is an example of this and it means the fear that the pathological dependent of technology must be unable to use it [1, 2].", "These new behaviors derived from digital practices are transformative on a collective scale as [3] affirm about the process of global change associated with the social, technological and time -to-use of these technologies is changing social practices as well as creating new ones. These changes pointed out by [3] have been observed since the mid -1990s when this theme aroused interest and, with new technological resources emerging, human behavior has been transformed, including uncontrolled use that can cause damage to physical and psychological health, not only caused by the use of the internet. In addition to the dependence of the Internet as it has been studied previously, the dependence on social networks and communication applications has also been researched [4].", "All this scenario of Internet, social networks and celular phones, is not limited to individual situations constituting a social phenomenon, given its collective characteristic, influencing organizational environments, until now not contemplated [5].", "Excessive, indiscriminate use and for many consecutive hours by employees at work can adversely affect individual performance, organizational results, and the personal life of individuals, beyond collective behavior. As collective human behavior interferes with organizational culture, digital habits in organizations can influence this culture, which is as influential in human behavior and in organizations as it is invisible and, paradoxical as it may be, is strong enough to forge the organizational profile [6].", "The objective of this research was to evaluate the digital dependence of employees who do not hold management position s, the perception of leaders on the digital dependence of these employees and to compare results of the two groups in the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Supply, (MALS) in Brasilia city, Federal District of Brasil. The visions collected (employees and leaders) are important because of their different perspectives for the same type of questions", "Method The keyword searched in MeSH - Medical Subject Headings did not find terms that express these contents. Due to the unprecedented nature of this theme in organizations, key words were created that revealed the essence of the theme. Prior to the application of the research, the Social Communications area of the organ searched communicated to the employees and leaders what the research was and its subject, besides the conditions of access and that the data would be treated collectively, ensuring the confidentiality of the answers.", "The two statistically validated scales were applied on line, simultaneously, from 03/01/2019 to 04/15/2019, with a final sample of 330 volunteers with no management positions and 96 leader’s volunteers (with management positions) of both sexes with ages between 18 to 65 years. The electronic data collection used a computational resource from the Ministry of Agriculture , Livestock and Supply (MALS), generating two separated databases for employees and leaders, from which results were tabulated, extracted percentage from the answers, analysis, discussion and conclusions.", "The data analysis of the answers was done by question, of the two scales according to tables 1 and 2 and analyzed separately, ending with a comparison between them. It percentages obtained from each question by answer option (never, rarely, frequently and always) were extracted to know the opinions of the volunteers about each one of them allowing to know their digital practices. For factor analysis we used the software [7]. The EDDE scale has 19 questions with options: Never/Rarely (0), Frequently (1) and Always (2) to check the frequency of use of digital technologies by employees in an organizational environment and the EPLDDE scale has 17 questions and the same options of the EDDE.", "The limitations to the application of the research were derived from bureaucratic and normative aspects of the organ searched and did not influence the results.", "Inclusion Criteria For the EPLDDE survey, it was necessary to have a management position and for the EDDE not to hold these positions and to be active in the functions.", "Exclusion Criteria Volunteers with positions of leadership for EDDE and without positions of leadership for the EPLDDE.", "Results Descriptive Statistics Results obtained from demographic data showed adequacy to what was requested as reported in the Discussion section. Errors in data filling by volunteers generated elimination of questionnaires answered, ending the sample in women (34.5%). The predominant age group was 31- 40 years old with 95 employees (29%). Higher education and specialization predominated with 189 (57.2%). About 96 leaders, predominant age group among leaders was between 41 -50 years old with about 30% of leaders. The prevalent degrees of education are higher education and specialization with (63%). The results are presented by scale, with analysis in the Discussion section.", "Factor Analysis (Fa) The same Factor Analysis was performed for both result sets (EDDE and EPLDDE Scale). The first test was Bartlett’s Sphericity test to see if the variables are correlated with each other and in both cases the results pointed to a non- covariance matrix. equal to identity. The next test was to verify the suitability of AF by KMO (Kaiser - Meyer - Olkin) having found a value of 0.79363 for EDDE and 0.78141 for EPLDDE, values very close to 0.8 and considered good according to [8, 9].", "Due to the results found in the Bartlett and KMO tests, it was appropriate to perform the AF, and the factor loads were verified using the Factor Loads, Screeplot and Parallel Analysis criteria. The most appropriate results for both EDDE and EPLDDE were by Screeplot that indicated the total of 5 factors in both scales. Finally, Cronbach’s Alpha was calculated to measure the internal consistency of the scale, and found", "0.7790 for EDDE and 0.8460 for EPLDDE,", "indicating satisfactory consistency [10].", "Results Overview Emphasis is placed on the low level of concern of employees regarding restrictions on the use of their digital media in service, as well as the total adherence to the use of their own media in service. Additionally, they believe that the overuse of their digital devices does not detract from their performance and, on the contrary, aid in good relationship with their colleagues. Employees are reassured about the freedom granted by the organization to use their digital devices, including for work purposes, which is reflected in the results.", "The results of the leade r’s point to a general context where there is no concern with the digital practices of their employees regarding indiscriminate use at work, nor with the labor legislation due to problems with hours in service out of the work, through the cellular devices, without the due remuneration.

Pandemics and epidemics can affect people’s physical and emotional health and disrupt society, usually resulting in a high level of psychological distress and psychosocial maladjustment [1].", "Social isolation tends to provoke psychological reactions, such as increased levels of anxiety, stress and irritability, propitiate the appearance of fears (based on real or subjective information) and confused thinking, affecting negatively the individual’s ability to make coherent decisions [2]. The impacts of social isolation on physical and mental well -being are well known. Isolation, loneliness, among other behaviors and feelings, tend to affect individuals as well as those around them, and this is especially the case during the COVID -19 pandemic [3]. In terms of commuting limitations, professional activity in the Home Office modality has become “savior” of jobs, companies, businesses, ensuring continuity of work, remotely, even though not all people have ideal conditions to work at home. The lack of these conditions can, over time, have consequences on human behavior and cause changes in the general well -being of the subjects. Physical impacts Digital Ergonomics needs to be observed, as physical damage related to improper postures and incorrect furniture when using", "devices from the digital world at home, can cause damage [4]. The improper handling of computers, cell phones, tablets, among others, has favored the appearance of pathologies and functional physical limitations that are being observed more frequently in medical offices [5]. The phototoxicity of violet light from digital devices can lead to progressive degeneration of the macula, a noble area of vision, which can cause irreversible damage to individuals exposed continuously and prolonged to this luminosity [6].", "Face -to-face solitude Loneliness and social isolation are living conditions that can increase the likelihood of mental disorders such as depression, anxiety, substance use and cognitive decline [7]. Loneliness shakes people’s ability to self-regulate and represents the pain of feeling alone [8]. Working from home office requires constant evaluation in all aspects. We must observe if the individual is able to withstand the repetition of work at ho me, daily, the absence of colleagues to talk in person, in addition to the feeling of disconnection with the organization or group to which he belongs. It is possible to lose control of time, due to not sharing it with other people, aggravated by the excessive use of digital technologies, reinforcing the solitary character of the home office, which can lead to behavioral changes harmful to health. The opposition between coexistence and isolation is intensified by the role of new communication technolog ies and social networks that fix the individual in front of screens [9].", "Food compulsion Eating disorders are a group of conditions characterized by persistent disturbances in food or behaviors related to it, which result in changes in the consumption or absorption of food, impairing physical health and psychosocial functioning [10]. Home office workplaces individuals too close to the refrigerator and pantry and, being at home, requires a lot of determination to stick to mealtimes, in choosing what to eat and in what quantities. It is really surprising that we use ice cream and other fatty foods when we are sitting at home feeling totally alone in the world [8]. The home office can be a reinforcing or revealing vector of eating disorders due to one of its c haracteristics, which is isolation in the development of work.Disclosure The authors declare no conflicts of interest.", "References Zhang J, Wu W, Zhao X, Zhang W (2020) Recommended psychological crisis intervention response to the 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia outbreak in China: A model of Wes t China Hospital.

Our objective was to investigate the level of digital addiction among employees in a Brazilian Federal corporation of Information and Communication Technology. method: Online application of a previously validated 20-item questionnaire constructed to evaluate the level of digital addiction within the workplace. A sample of 301 volunteers from the entire staff of the surveyed organization was selected. results: Collected data were submitted to a question -by-question percentage evaluation; individual results were not discussed. Tabulated results were submitted to statistical evaluation and showed the collective level digital addiction detected by each question. Results suggested the occurrence of moderate to severe addiction, but the overall addiction level was low.", "conclusion: Results demonstrate the digital addiction stage of the sample studied, contribute to the debate of this collective phenomenon in organizations and may stimulate other similar projects. *Corresponding author LL Gonçalves, Institute of Psychiatry (IPUB), Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ), Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.", "Submitted : 18 March 2021; Accepted : 24 March 2021; Published : 01 Apr 2021", "Introduction Quality of life is the individual’s own perception of one’s position within the context of the culture and value systems in which one lives and in relation to goals, expectations, standards and concerns. It is a comprehensive concept, affected in a complex way by the person’s physical health, psychological state, level of indepen - dence, social relations and its relationship with salient character - istics of one’s environment. Quality of life within an organization must include a comfortable and favorable working environment, including ergonomics and digital etiquette (1 -3). Today, with the evolution of di gital technologies and the intensification of their use, employee behavior has a relevant role in the establishment of good practices leading to an adequate condition for the entire organization: Abusive use and its resultant digital addiction must be avoi ded.", "In a study performed with volunteers with abusive use and/ or addiction to digital technologies in daily life, King et al (4). Have shown that personal, social, academic and professional life are compromised According to Gonçalves, digital addiction has grown within organizations, whose leaders seem unprepared to identify and understand its effects, which interfere in human be - havior within the organizational environment and consequently in performance and expected results, as well as in the cultural frame - work (5). Our objective was to investigate possible digital addic - tion of employees of a Brazilian Federal organization operating in information and communication technology, aiming to broaden the debate on the theme.", "Method:", "The target population included employees of a Brazilian Federal organization operating in information and communication tech - nology. The sample included 301 volunteers not occupying man - agerial positions aged 18 to 65 years. The study consisted of an online applica tion of a previously validated 20 -item questionnaire constructed to evaluate the level of digital addiction within the workplace Virtual data collection was made available for 30 days and offered the Employee Digital Addiction Scale questionnaire containin g 20 questions with four response options (Never, Rarely, Frequently, Always) (6). The confidentiality of the individual volunteer responses was safeguarded by access to individual data restricted to the research team; Only collective results are made publ icly available.", "A preliminary test with volunteers with profiles similar to those of the sample showed that responders needed 14 to 18 minutes to complete the questionnaire. At the end of data collection, a data - base was created to perform descriptive statistics analysis, factorial analysis, factor loads, Screeplot, Parallel Analysis and internal consistency, using the R programming language software (7).", "Results Data: Out of the 301 completed questionnaires, mistakes were de tected in the sum of the question scores of 7 volunteers which were excluded; thus, a workable data set with 294 entries was evaluated; this is an adequate number for a 20 -item questionnaire.", "Descriptive Statistics:", "Responders were classified into age bands. The 41 - 50 and 51 - 60 bands presented percentages of 25.2% and 26.3% respectively; thus, more than half of responders were employees with a long professional history. The 31 - 40 band was the most populous, in cluding 39.3% of the sample. Thus, 90.8% of included volunteers ranged from 31 - 50 years. Two -thirds of respondents are male.

These revealed, respectively, a satisfactory correlation between variables and suitability for factorial analy - sis (8, 9). The scale was analyzed by 3 criteria: Factorial Loads, Screeplot and Parallel Analysis, and the Screeplot indicated the ex- istence of 3 factors and the withdrawal of only one issue (question 7) from the scale. The internal consistency presented a Cronbach’s Alpha of 0.764 which signals consistency between the variables in addition to satisfactory internal consistency of the scale", "Results by Subject: Table 1 presents percentages response options where CCT&O stands for Computers, Cellphones, Tablets & Oth- er digital media (this table can be found after the References into this manuscript). Discussion:", "It is necessary to expand investigations on this phenomenon in the collective organizational environments for greater consistent data. Individual performance must include features of quality of life, in- cluding the non -abusive use of digital technologies (12). The data set was satisfactory considering the number of 20 questions of the initial scale.", "Question #1 shows that most respondents do not destabilize with Internet access restrictions, with “Never” (12.5%) plus “Frequently” (22.6%) and “Always” (5.8%) added up to 28.4% signalin g over ¼ of destabilized per - sons. This is an important point to be grasped by company lead - ers, because it shows that company enforced restrictions, often unavoidable for safety or productivity, can destabilize part of the workforce.", "Question #2 indicates that virtually ¼ (23.2%) of respondents “never” prioritize personal communication at the expense of work, while 66% said this “rarely” happens, which totals 89.2%; thus, the workforce is extremely focused on their tasks. However, it should be noted because the personal use of digital resources intermingles with work use, the perception about prioritization becomes relative and cannot be seen in an isolated and definitive manner", "Question #3 we see that than 35% stated that personal use of dig- ital media “never” impacts their work performance. The option “rarely” appears at an expressive rate of 52.5% totaling 87.2% in - stances of “Never”+ “Rarely”.", "Question #4 , the high percentage of 78.8% for “Never” plus “Rarely” reveals that employees are not worried about restric - tions of use to their devices in the office; thus, the implementation of such restrictions is not critical. This is a higher percentage of “Never” plus “Rarely” compared to Que stion #1, which also refers to such restrictions. This lack of concern occurs either because respondents do not believe in their implantation or because they do not feel harmed, if they occur. In the latter case the meaning is that most of responders are not so digitally dependent. But this still shows that 21.2% of the volun - teers are bothered with restraints.", "Question #5 shows that actions implemented by the organization aimed at minimizing digital addiction recorded 89.6% declaring no concern for these actions. (“Never” plus “Rarely”).", "As in Question #4 “Never” and “Rarely” are predominant. Question #6 deals with a perception by employees of a lack of company concern about digital addiction; 39.6% (“Frequently” plus “Always”) perceive the company’s unconcern about it. In contrast, 60.4% “Never” or “Rarely” notice this lack of concern.", "Question #7 deals with this new digital scenario and the corresponding labor relations issue regarding the use of personal digital devices in the workplace: here, “Never” plus “Rarely” provide a high percentage (71.2%) of awareness of these labor aspects; in contrast, 28.8% appear to be unaware of these aspects, probably because of their newness, having come into existence in this dig - ital age.", "Question #8 deals with the problem of whether efficiency is im - proved by indiscriminate personal use of digital devices. A significant 71% of responders “Never” or “Rarely” believe that such use improves work performance, although 29% (“Frequently” plus “Always” believe that such improvement occurs. These results should be compared to with those of Question #3, where, 87.2% believe that “Never” or “Rarely” their performance is affected by the excessive use of digital technologies. Taken jointly these results show that excessive use does not disturb performance, neither does it improve performance.", "Question #9 discusses the boundary between normal or accept - able versus abusive use of CCT&O: on ly 13.2% admit to break - ing the boundary; this is a low but expectable percentage, because users themselves may not perceive their excesses. Results for this Question #9 converges with Questions #1, #2, #4, #5. In all five, the “Never” + “Rarely” are very close to each other, signaling the internal consistency of the questionnaire.", "Question #10 looks at the physical health of employees. The rest intervals from digital devices for exercising is an important factor for relaxation form digital activities, alleviating their intensive use. “Never” plus “Rarely” reaches 77.7%, meaning that responders do not waive these intervals.", "Question #11 examines all forms of leisure breaks; as noted relaxing is vital to health and 71.2% answered they “Never” or “Rarely” avoid taking such breaks, which ratifies the importance of such intervals in the eyes of the responders.", "Question # 12 looks at how the use of private devices at the work - place is handled: although 68.6% say they do not use their private devices in the workplace, 31.4% admit to using them. This reinforces two aspects made available by mobility. The first is the breaking of the boundaries between working time vs. leisure or workplace vs. home; the second, certainly valid for Brazil, is that the use of own equipment can lead to labor relation problems because Brazilian legislation does not provide for such situations.", "Question 13 dwells on the problem of digital freedom, generat ing the most balanced results: 44.5% of our sample (“Never” plus “Rarely”) believe that company digital freedom induces no motivation; contrarily, 55.5% (“Frequently” plus “Always”) feel motivated by this freedom. Compared with responses to Question #12, this greater motivation reinforces the 31.4% of respondents to the said ques tion, who admitted using their devices at work.", "Question #14 covers the minimization of relations between work colleagues due to the use of the technologies: 87.2% volunteers (“Never” plus “Rarely”) deny compromised relations with col - leagues because of the devices.", "Question #15 reinforces this aspect of digital freedom in the workplace: the 62.5% (“Frequently” plus “Always”) found here reinforce answers to Question #13, where 55.5% are comfortable about more freedom; thus, these two questions reinforce response coherence.", "Question #16 deals with the negative effects of abusive use of digital technologies. A majority (81.8% of “Never” plus “Rarely”) are conscious of the effects of abusive use of technologies. This is an obviously positive expectation for the management of this ad - diction in organizations.", "Leaderships should permanently observe this aspect (14).", "Question #17 revisits inter -employee relations as a function of digital technology use, previously discussed in Question #14; better/worse relations are balanced with a tie between antithetic “Rarely” or “Frequently” at differ slightly, the balance between opinions is obvious.", "Question #18 , on concealing inter -colleague relations through CCT& O from the company, this question achieved the highest of response consistency throughout the entire research, with 95.9% (“Never” plus “Rarely”) denying such concealment. Regardless of organizational permission there appears to be a private forum from the point of view of volunteers.", "Question #19 deals with employee expectation of recognition/ praise messages from the company/boss via digital devices; as in the previous question and with the second highest result the “Nev - er” plus “Rarely” sum (94.6%) si gnaling no expectation of managerial reinforcement through the digital media.", "Question #20 deals with the use of digital devices for personal use when this is prohibited by th e company, 79.3% (“Never” plus “Rarely”) means adherence to discipline, which requires follow up on how much people actually have control over digital use (15).", "In general terms this discussion must close on a note of caution. On every application of this instrument, profile of respondents must be scrutinized, because the researcher will be able to observe that results reveal varied characteristics. As an example, as this field of research belongs in the context of digital technologies, a specific employee profile is found; not simply because of the daily use of technologies, but also because, technological organizations are more flexible than less technological and orthodox organizations. If this instrument is applied in traditional organizations, specific results may arise as environment and culture shape the values of employees. By aggregating data from very different types of organizations this questionnaire may result in distortions of incremental results that will hamper more accurate analyzes of the phe nomenon under study. Although data insertion goes into the same database, transforming analyzable results into equivalent numbers, one must observe the phenomenon by the angle of organizational profile and culture, as mentioned.", "In our sample, digital devices do not seem to compromise organizational dynamics because high responder percentages denied features that would classify the sample as digital addiction. Such situations remain balanced in face of prohibition of digital access or not prioritizing their private life at the expense of work or not having their performance reduced by abusive use, none of these seem to worry most of the responders, indicating an absence of addiction. Digital freedom is cherished as a motivator; most do not worry about a ctions that minimize addiction, but many admit to occasional abusive use.", "Limitations that did not compromise the result were identified: (a) the novelty of the Digital Addiction theme, as well as the first ap- plication of this Employee Digital Addiction Scale (B) the online application, advantageous for reaching respondents, but demanding in the management of the process to prevent responder losses.", "(C) the lack of comprehension by organizational leaders who did not perceive the importance of research in these environments and refused participation. (D) the fear of functional losses of respondents, even though confidentiality and collective treatment of responses were ensured. Conclusions It is necessary to relativize results mainly where the respondents are employees of organization intensive in digital technologies which makes them experienced in the use, generating more natural perceptions regarding its use, although to the researcher, it seems to him to use abuse or addiction. The general objective pro posed for this research was achieved according to results and its discus sion, being able to contribute to the theme Digital Addiction in the organizational segment, besides interest for teachers and students of human behavior and others correlated.", "ANNEX 1", "Scale to evaluate the employee’s digital addiction (EDAS).

In order to specifically evaluate the use of WhatsApp we need a specific instrument to investigate routines, durations, frequencies of access, among other issues, in order to plan and consciously use the tool.7 No such instrument is presently available. The objective of this project is the production and validation of a scale to evaluate the dependence of WhatsApp and arrive at an instrument of investigation and data collection related this ubiquitous tool. For a newly created scale to be validated it is necessary to develop its content strictly aligned with the subject and the research objectives and then to promote and submit the same to expert evaluation. There is no consensus to define the number of experts who should participate in the validation of a scale; this is left to the discretion of the research team.

These were only collected for informational purposes and not taken into account for statistical analysis and expert validation of the scale.", "Sample, Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria. Volunteers included to participate in the scale validation came from the following categories: (i) people who came to our facility because of suspected abusive use of WhatsApp; (ii) Companions of the previous group; (iii) students and employees, (iv) any who agreed to participate. They were randomly recruited through posters at the institution, verbal communication from person to person and on social networks. Participants should be between the ages of 16 and 65 and have a cell phone or computer with internet access. Exclusion criteria were: illiterate people and persons with some me ntal impairment that would prevent them from using WhatsApp. The 200 selected volunteers individuals were divided into a Main or Control through the application of the Internet Addiction Test (IAT).11 The Main group included volunteers with IAT scores ≥ 50, whereas the Control Group included participants with IAT scores < 50. We were able to use 95 of the questionnaires in the Main Group and 90 in the Control Group. Discarded questionnaires presented incomplete scales, discontinued participation or lack of accompanying persons when minors. Results were entered into a database for statistical analysis.

This difference ratifies the presence of dependence in the Main Group and its absence in the Control Group). Factorial analysis . The Bartlett sphericity test was applied to verify if the variables are correlated with each other. In this test, the null hypothesis is that the correlation matrix is equal to the identity matrix. For the data set, a statistic p -value <0.001, implying that the covariance matrix is not equal to identity; this shows a clear correlation between the variables.", "The Kaiser -Meyer -Olkin (KMO) criterion was used to verify the adequacy of the factor analysis. The value found was 0.883; values above 0.8, are considered good.16 In Table 2, we exhibit the MSA indices for each of the variables. Due to the results found for both Bartlett and KMO, we considered that it was appropriate to carry out the factorial analysis for the scale.", "The next step was to check the factor loads to determine the number of relevant factors. We used 3 criteria: Factorial Load, Screeplot and Parallel Analysis. Table 3 shows the factorial loads.", "It is advisable16 to use factor loads with cumulative proportions > 0.9. However, for the data set, we would have to use 11 factors, which in practice would not solve the problem of data reduction.

Figure 1 presents this criterion.", "According to this criterion, we must use 4 factors, and in this case, the commonalities of the variables are presented in the table below (Table 4). Analyzing the commonalities, question 8 (“How often do you usually post your photos in WhatsApp to see if someone comments, in order to feel more valued?”) should be excluded due to a community of less than 0.5. However, due to its value being very close to 0.5, it was considered valid.", "The third criterion used to find the number of factors was the Parallel Analysis. By this criterion, the number of factors found was equal to 3, and its commonalities are presented in Table 5.", "For the number of factors equal to 3, we must withdraw four questions (from the initial scale with 20) that will be cited in the discussion of this study, because they present commonalities smaller than 0.5.

The scores of Main and control groups in the Internet Addiction Test sharply and significantly separated addicted Main Group (score 17.03) from Control Group (score 8.18) entries (p < 0.001). The factorial analysis was performed in consequence of the satisfactory results of the Bartlett sphericity test, which presented a significantly low p -value, indicating a correlation between the variables.

The Screeplot Criterion indicated 4 factors and the withdrawal of only one question from the scale. The Parallel Analysis Criterion pointed out 3 factors and the withdrawal of 4 questions because they presented commonalities less than 0.5. Within this scenario we chose to adopt the Parallel Analysis Criterion with the least number of factors and with the withdrawal of the four questions displayed in the Results section. The withdrawal of these four questions from the initial scale with 20 questions made the final scale more consistent and concise, with 16 questions.", "Finally, we consider it important to highlight the excellent Cronbach Alpha 16 value of 0.909; This confirms the consistency of the scale within the objectives for which it was developed and tested. Because of the novelty of the scale, we decided to clarify to the participating volunteers what this research represented, its objectives and the importance of the understanding of our intentions; we also indicated the use to be made of the data; this leads us to firmly believe that responses were reliable; this scenario was built jointly between the research team and the participants as a way to obtain the best results.", "The limitation of the study was related to the difficulty of producing a totally new scale without the benefit of similar results, upon which we could base ourselves. CONCLUSION The results obtained provided a validated final version for the WhatsApp Dependence Scale (WADS) with 16 clear, accurate and reliable questions, appropriate to clinical contexts hopefully useful for future research. The statistical results showed that the issues of the final version of WADS presented alignment among them, qualifying it as positive to measure WhatsApp dependence.

The theme has turned into a serious global problem and one which grows continually.

(ii) accompanying persons (iii) students, employees and any others who agreed to participate, who were randomly recruited through posters at the institution, verbal communication from person to person and on social networks.", "Inclusion Criteria . Participants should be aged 17 to 65 years and fulfilling conditions for inclusion in either of the two groups.", "Exclusion Criteria . illiterate candidates and persons with some kind of mental impairment that would prevent them from using digital games.", "RESULTS Descriptive Statistics . Table 1 shows the results of the descriptive statistics of the sample, divided into Main and Control groups. For each characteristic we present the absolute number and the proportion within its group. Demographic data were collected for statistical purposes and not considered in the expert evaluation Scores for the original 20 -question scale . The mean ± standard deviation score for the Control group was 2.55 ± 3.92, while the corresponding value for the Main group was 7.05 ± 10.3 The t-test of means between the two groups produced a p-value < 0.001 (t- statistic = 3.940). This indicates a significantly higher level of damage in the Main group vs. the Control group and ratifies, prima facie, the characteristics of the groups, namely dependence in the main group vs. little or no dependence in the control group. Factor analysis . The first test performed was the Bartlett sphericity test to determine if the variables are correlated with each other. In this test, the null hypothesis is that the correlation matrix, based on Spearman’s correlation matrix is equal to the identity matrix. For the data set, we found a statistic equal to 3046.163 and a p-value <0.001, implying that the covariance matrix is not equal to identity. The next criterion used to check the adequacy of a factor analysis was the Kaiser - Meyer -Olkin (KMO) criterion. Its value was equal to 0.921; values above 0.8 are considered appropriate.7 Table 2 displays the Measurement of Sampling Adequacy (MSA) indices for each of the variables.", "Both the Bartlett test and the KMO criterion allowed us to proceed to the factor analysis for the questionnaire.", "The factor analysis to determine the number of relevant factors included 3 criteria: Factor Load, Screeplot and Parallel Analysis. Table 3 shows the factor loads, estimated by the method of the principal components:", "Factor loads whose cumulative proportion exceed 0.9 should be used.7 However, for the data set, we would have to use 11 factors, which in practice would not solve the problem of data reduction. We moved to the Screeplot criterion of the correlation matrix, where we must eliminate the factors related to Eigenvalues > 1. Figure 1 presents this criterion:", "By this criterion, we must use 3 factors, and in this case, the commonalities of the variables are presented in table 4. Because Question #13 (How often do you perceive pains in the body due to staying during long periods of playing?) had a commonality less than 0.5 it was excluded. The third criterion used to find the number of factors was the Parallel Analysis. By this criterion, the number of factors found was equal to 1, which does not allow for an adequate estimation of the Factor loads. Therefore, after the three analyzes, we selected the Screeplot result, which points to commonalities for 3 factors and to the withdrawal of only one item from the questionnaire.", "The last step of the study was to calculate Cronbach’s alpha,7 in order to measure the internal consistency of the questionnaire. The value found was 0.955, which is very good, ensuring the internal consistency of the instrument.7", "DISCUSSION Although the pathological use of games predates the Digital Age, its steep increase came with the birth and growth of computer technologies and of the Internet. Globalization and the continuous increase in the number of digital players has turned digital gaming into a social fact.14,15,16 A final validated scale was constructed, with the purpose of being used in clinical practice which fully met what was proposed, namely the evaluation of dependence to the pathological digital game. Therefore, it has become essential to assess its breadth and impact on people’s lives. It is necessary to have a scale validated in a structured manner that can provide elements directed to a specific evaluation that meets the needs of health professionals who must develop strategies for the treatment and care for digital players. King et al.13 reported that there is a commitment in personal, social, academic and professional life in people with abusive use and/or dependent on digital gaming in their daily lives.", "The inclusion of volunteers in the Main and Control groups through the unspecific Internet Addiction Test was useful, because it led to a successful differentiation between the groups through the original 20- question scale: the Main Group scored 7.05, nearly triple and significantly different from the Control Group, at 2.55. This established the main group’s dependent vs. the control group’s non-dependent profiles.", "The Factor analysis was performed as a consequence of (i) the satisfactory results of the Bartlett sphericity test which presented low p-value <0.001, indicating a correlation between the variables; (ii) the adequacy of the Kaiser -Meyer -Olkin (KMO) criterion analysis, which was higher than 0.9 in 14 items, higher than 0.8 in 6 items.", "In terms of the factor loads, 3 criteria were chosen: the Factor Loads criterion found 11 factors, an high number for 20 questions. The Screeplot criterion indicated 3 factors and the withdrawal of only one question from the scale, namely “How often do you notice body aches because of staying for long periods of time?” The criterion of Parallel Analysis pointed to only 1 factor. We chose t he Screeplot Criterion with 3 factors and the withdrawal of the single question, leading to a scale with 19 questions. It is also important to highlight the excellent Cronbach Alpha7 result, with a value of 0.955, which ratifies the internal consistency of the scale, corroborating the previous evaluations, within the objective of this project.", "Table 4. Commonalities for 3 Factors.", "Regarding the limitations of the study, there were no previous similar instruments to aid us as a model. This finding did not compromise the results, but required greater care in the elaboration, validation and application of the scale. We understand that further studie s on the effects of digital games on individuals may enhance eventual future instruments.", "CONCLUSION The results obtained provided a validated final version for the scale to evaluate the dependence of pathologic digital gaming with 19 questions appropriate to clinical and research contexts in terms of clarity, accuracy and reliability. Statistical results showed that the final version of the scale presented questions in mutual alignment, qualifying it as a positive instrument to measure dependence to pathological digital gaming. The version displayed in the appendix can be confidently used as a pathological digital game dependence scale whenever necessary, in clinical scenarios, as well as to perform specific research on this subject.

The greater the number of specialists, the greater the tendency to disagree between them, whereas a smaller selection (less than 3) has a greater risk of a 100% agreement. In the present study, 6 specialists were selected for the development of the scale.", "In the 20 questions of the initial version of PDAUTS dependence was rated as mild, moderate and severe physical loss. Each question afforded three possible replies: Never/ Rarely (0 points); Often (1) and Always (2). Volunteers were asked to insert the corresponding response value next to each question. The scored points should be added so as to allow each person to receive a dependence rank. The resulting sum obtained classified the volunteers in the following categories: 0 to 10 (without disturbances); 11 to 20 (mild disorders); 21 to 30 (moderate); 31 to 40 (severe).", "For validation, we obtained demographic data, namely (a) age, (b) gender, (c) employment and (c) degree of education; this information was only used to identify the selected volunteers, not being considered by the specialists for the validation of PDAUTS. Sample and Inclusion Criteria . The sample consisted of 200 volunteers who came the nucleus Delete with Conscious Use of Technologies of the Institute of Psychiatry (IPUB) of the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ) with abusive (daily/many hours) of use of cellphone, tablet, computers, among others (CT&O). In add iction we included to Institute staff, University students and people interested in participating in the research. Recruitment was implemented through posters at the institution, verbal invitation and via social networks. Participants were aged between 16 and 69 years who make daily use of CT&O technologies. All participants agreed to voluntarily respond to the survey. Individuals were divided into two groups: Main Group (100 participants with abusive use of CT&O) and Control Group (100 participants without daily or abusive use of CT&O). Abusive use of CT&O was determined through the Internet Addiction Test (IAT) scale.7 Main Group participants scored ≥ 50 points on the IAT scale while the Control Group included volunteers scoring < 50 points Inclusion Criteria . The Main Group was composed of individuals who used the technologies for at least three consecutive hours daily, whether for internet consultations, message exchanges, social networking or electronic games on tablets, desktops or cell phones, and also by volunteers previously submitted to the Internet Addiction scale (IAT)7 with scores in the ≥ 50 point s range. The Group Control was composed of volunteers who scored < 50 points.", "Exclusion criteria . Illiterates, or individuals with severe clinical comorbidity that interfered with the interview protocol, such as personality disorders, bipo lar disorder and substance abuse, were excluded from the study.", "Of the initial sample, 95 volunteers from Group 1 Principal and 90 from Group 2 were effectively used. The discards were due to participant withdrawal, incomplete scales or lack of responsible escort when underage. The results of the survey were entered into a database for statistical analysis.", "RESULTS Below we present the results of the descriptive statistics, the results of the tests of hypotheses of differences of means and the factor analysis. For the analysis of the data we used the packages “dplyr,8 “psy”9 and “paran”10 and the Program R, version 3.4.2.11 Throughout the work, the data were divided into Control Group and Main Group (Table 1).", "Table 1 presents demographic data and exhibits the characteristics of the sample, especially in terms of the random selection of volunteers: this can be perceived, for example, by age groups with relevant variability; analogously, by the variability of the levels of instruction showing very few volunteers in Masters and PhD levels. In addition, the two groups of volunteers also presented significantly different percentages between the male and female genders. All this reinforces the random criterion of choice of volunteers, although it was no t a research objective to link any of these variables to the results or the validation of the scale itself. Scores for the 20 original question scale . The mean ± standard deviation score for the Control group was 5.19 ± 4.61, while the corresponding value for the Main group was 15.00 ± 8.21 The t-test of means between the two groups produced a p -value < 0.001 (t - statistic = 10.05); this indicates a significantly higher level of physical loss in the Main group vs. no loss in Control group. Thus, the differen tiation of the Control vs. Principal qualifies, prima facie, the effectiveness of the 20 questions included in the test, and allowed us to proceed with the required statistical tests to validate to the PDAUTS questionnaire. Factorial analysis. The first test performed was the Bartlett sphericity test to verify if the variables are correlated with each other. In this test, the null hypothesis is that the correlation matrix is equal to the identity matrix. For our data set, a statistic of 1917.96 (p < 0.001) was found, implying that the covariance matrix was not equal to the identity.", "The criterion used to verify the adequacy of the factor analysis was the Kaiser -Meyer - Olkin (KMO) test. The value found was 0.799, which is practically equal to 0.8, a value that, in the literature, 12 is considered good.", "Due to the results found for both the Bartlett test and the Kaiser -Meyer -Olkin (KMO) test, it was appropriate to perform the factorial analysis for the scale. We therefore checked the factorial loads to determine the number of relevant factors. We used 3 criteria: Factorial Load, Screeplot and Parallel Analysis. Table 2 shows the factor loads", "In the literature,12 it is recommended to use factor loads whose sum results in a value above 0.9, and worst case, above 0.8. However, for the data set, we would have to limit ourselves to 9 questions, w hich in practice would not adequately solve the problem of data reduction. We then proceed to the Screeplot criterion of the correlation matrix, where we eliminate the factors related to Eigenvalues greater than 1. The graph below presents this criterion:", "1- Screeplot", "Figure 1. Screeplot. Components above the red line and whose variance is greater than 1 are the relevant components By this criterion, we must use 5 factors, and in this case, the commonalities of the variables are presented in Table 3:", "Analyzing the commonalities, it is may be seen that none of the 20 question of the initial scale had to be excluded because they present commonalities larger than 0.5. Values below 0.5 are considered non - significant.12 This means that the 20 questions were considered valid to remain on the scale.", "The third criterion used to find the number of factors was the Parallel Analysis. By this criterion, the number of factors found was equal to 3, as shown in Table 4: The problem encountered when using parallel analysis is that commonalities are very low, with only 12 questions reaching the minimum value of 0.5. Therefore, after the three analyzes we opted for the result of the Communalities for 5 factors (Table 3), which point to the permanence of the 20 items of the scal", "The last step of the study was to calculate Cronbach’s alpha parameter,12 in order to measure the internal consistency of the scale. The value found was 0.897, which in is considered very good.12 This means that the issues of the scale are aligned with each other, qualifying them as positive to measure the assessment of physical damages related to the abusive use of the technologies.", "DISCUSSION For the elaboration of a final validated scale that met the proposed goals, namely the evaluation of the physical damages related to the abusive use of technologies in everyday life (PDAUTS), it would have been necessary that all evaluation stages be fulfilled and that the suggested final adaptations after all statistical analyzes and by experts, successful.", "After assessing the initial scale (20 questions) by all six experts and checking all points of agreement and disagreement on each question and then the statistical analy sis of the data, a consensus was reached and it was decided that none of the question of the initial scale would need be excluded.", "The construction of this scale was entirely based on ergonomic concepts13 and on the observation of individuals with daily use of CT&O technologies, whether for leisure or work, and carefully noting the physical and emotional consequences. Maeno14 stated that repetitive stress injuries (RSI) and work -related musculoskeletal disorders (MSD) are the major causes of work absenteeism and disability caused by work -related illnesses, often caused by keeping inadequate positions for many hours.14 This project was the outcome of the need to create specific instruments to evaluate physical losses in order to elaborate Ergonomic strategies,15 because issues such as these are considered a public health problem and of interest to the entire population, as reported by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics: a recent National Health Survey reported that RSI/MSD was diagnosed in more than 3.5 million Brazilians over 18 years of age. 16 We also considered the need for a specific scale, such as reported herein, so that individuals can identify the relationship of his pathologies with the abusive use of the technologies and seek professional guidance as soon as possible. Physical examination17 is not sufficient for the diagnosis of RSI/MSD. It is necessary to check the ergonomic aspects of the work place (furniture suitability to the employee’s physical characteristics, lighting, environmental noise, etc.), as well as the intensity, frequency and duration of the habits related to the physical disorders presented.17 The scale may also identify the problems associated with poor posture and inadequate handling of technological devices that can be solved or minimized, provided that the individual is guided by professionals who identify the real problems through examinations and evaluations with appropriate instruments. An important example: when the screens are positioned well below the line of the eyes,18 the weight of the head causes postural compensations that affect the alignment of the vertebrae of the spine and increase of muscular rigidity for the sustentation of the corporal structures.19 Additionally, the identification of problems related to vision20 caused by the abusive use of CT&O can be checked with the use of this scale, as well as symptoms of dryness, irritation, blurred vision after two consecutive hours of exposure to the violet blue light emitted by screens. King et al21 observed not only vision problems but also complaints of changes in sleep, dizziness, memory loss and lack of concentration. They reported that many physical problems were related to improper postures and furniture when using the CT&O.21 As a limitation of the study, we came across an absence of specific validated instruments capable of investigating behavior using CT&O on a day -to-day basis, which might have helped us in the preparation of the present scal e..

In general, dependents typically spend ever increasing hours on the social networks, updating photos or posting comments, as a way to seek the same pleasurable sensations previously experienced with shorter periods of time. Without realizing, the dependent user is losing control of the situation and gradually, begins to replace real day-to-day programs with more time navigating.", "4. Abstinence symptoms and its", "effects. In general, dependent users with no internet access become angry, anxious and fearful; this changes sleep or eating patterns and may even lead to signs of depression. 5. Life conflicts , when excessive use of social networks compromise real-life relationships with family, friends, fellow students and co - workers.11 This is frequently the moment where the problem becomes self - evident. However, more often than not, dependent users feel unable to reduce or stop. This is the point of loss of control over behavior, which can compromise performance, educational, professional or other. The purpose of this study is to generate and validate a specific scale to assess Facebook dependence (FDS)", "MATERIALS AND METHODS Scale construction and validation was carried out in 5 phases:", "(1) Compilation of 20 questions, by six experts, trained teachers in the area of digital dependence.11 These questions were based on published studies,4,6 The concept was to cover the five elements outlined above: mood swings, self-relevance, tolerance, abstinence and real-life conflicts.", "(2) Critical evaluation and primary validation of the questions by six other specialists, who evaluated the content of the scale regarding presentation, clarity, pertinence and comprehension of the instrument.", "(3) Scale application to 200 volunteers, 100 abusive and daily Facebook users (Main Group) and 100 non-abusive users (Control Group). (4) Statistical analysis of data and results. (5) Adjustments based on the collected data and construction of the final validated version.", "There is no specific recommendation to define the number of experts who should participate in the validation of a scale, which is left at the discretion of the researcher. More specialists generate greater disagreement, whereas a smaller the number (less than 3) leads to a serious risk of 100% agreement.", "The original 20 -question scale was offered to the volunteers with three answer options: never/rarely, 0 points; often, 1 point; always, 2 points. After having answered all the questions, volunteers were asked to add up their points and find their level of dependence: < 7 points, no dependence; 7-16 points, light; 17 to 26 points, moderate and > 27 points, severe.", "We included Brazilian residents with any occupation, male and female, aged between 17 and 65 years, active Facebook users. We excluded illiterate persons or individuals with any mental impairment that prevented their participation.", "To participate in the FDS validation study, volunteers were recruited from (i) the Delete Nucleus patients with a complaint of abus ive, daily (for many hours) use of Facebook; (ii) their companions, (iii) students, employees and any others who agreed to participate. Recruitment was through posters at the institution, verbal communication and through the social networks.", "As noted above, the scale was applied to 200 selected volunteers, divided into two groups: Main Group (n = 100) and Control group (n = 100). The Internet Addiction Test (IAT)12 was used to divide them into a Main Group , with an IAT score ≥ 50 points and daily use (many hours) of Facebook, and a Control Group with IAT score < 50 points and less than daily use of Facebook. We used 95 Main Group and 90 Control Group participants. Discarded results presented incomplete scales or gave up participating. Collected results were entered into a database for statistical analysis. In the analysis of the results we used the R program, version 3.4.213 and the “dplyr”,14 “psy”15 and “paran”16 packages. Observed data were considered significant when a p < 0,001 occurred.", "RESULTS The following are the results of the descriptive statistics, the tests of hypotheses of differences of means, and the factorial analysis", "Descriptive Statistics . Table 1 shows the results of the descriptive statistics of the sample. For each characteristic, the absolute number of elements with the characteristic and the proportion within its group are displayed. Results confirm the random nature of the volunteer selection, although this was not a research objective of the project Scores for the 20-question original scale . The Main Group scored (mean ± standard deviation) 11.8 ± 8.7 points, while the Control group scored 5.8 ± 5.7 points. Student’s t-test yielded a t-statistic = 5.5, corresponding to a p <0.001. This difference ratifies the presence of dependence in the Main Group and its absence in the Control Group.", "Factor analysis . The Bartlett sphericity test was used to test correlation of the variables i.e. the questions) with each other. In this test, the null hypothesis is that the correlation matrix is equal to the identity matrix. For the answered questionnaire data set, a statistic of 1807.3 was obtained leading to a p < 0.001; this implies that the covariance matrix is not equal to identity.", "The Kaiser -Meyer -Olkin (KMO) criterion tested the adequacy of using the factor analysis. The value found was 0.875; values above 0.8 are considered satisfactory.", "The results for the Bartlett test and the KMO allowed us to proceed to the factorial analysis for the questionnaire variables. Factor loads were evaluated to determine the number of relevant factors. We used three criteria: Factorial Load, Screeplot and Parallel Analysis", "Figure 1 - Screeplot of components. Points above the red line present variances > 1; these are the relevant components.", "It is adequate to use Factorial loads with cumulative proportion above 0.9, and in worst case, above 0.8.14,16,17 The second criterion is the Screeplot of the correlation matrix, where we eliminate factors related to Eigenvalues > 1. Figure 1 presents his criterion:", "By this criterion, we must use 5 factors, and in this case, the commonalities of the 20 variables (FDS(n) questions) are presented in the table 3:", "Analyzing the commonalities, two questions (highlighted in bold) should be excluded because they present commonalities < 0.5. The deleted questions were: “How often do you believe everything posted on Facebook?” and “How often do you usually play on Facebook?”, The third usable criterion to determine the number of factors would be the Parallel Analysis. By this criterion, the number of factors found was equal to 1, which does not allow us to adequately verify the factorial loads. Parallel analysis was therefore left out. Thus, after the three analyzes we opted for the Screeplot result that points to 5 factors and to the withdrawal of 2 items from the scale.", "The last step of the study was to calculate Cronbach’s alpha,18 in order to measure the internal consistency of the questionnaire. The value found was 0.908, which is considered excellent.17 This means that the questions used for the scale are aligned with each other, qualifying it as positive to measure Facebook dependence.", "DISCUSSION The set of data obtained with the collection of volunteer questionnaire responses was satisfactory considering the number of items in the scale (initially with 20 items) and the number of valid questionnaires (185).", "The internal consistency by Cronbach’s Alpha18 presented a value of 0.908, indicating the alignment of the questions and satisfactory levels of the structuring of the scale to measure Facebook dependence.", "Factor analysis could be performed due to the appropriately low p value of the Bartlett sphericity test, indicating that there is a correlation between the variables, allowing the creation of the factors.", "The KMO criterion confirmed the adequacy of the factorial analysis with 18 of the 20 items of the scale with values above 0.8, which is considered satisfactory. By the criterion of the Parallel Analysis, the factor loads had a number of factors equal to 1 and could not be adequately verified. For this reason, we performed a more precise investigation through the Screeplot that indicated 5 factors leading to the withdrawal of 2 items from the original scale, because they displayed a communality of less than 0.5. The deleted questions were: “How often do you believe everything posted on Facebook?” and “How often do you usually play on Facebook?”, The exclusion of the two questions did not affect the validity of instrument, because the remaining issues effectively measure the dimensions of dependence; in this manner, the 18 -question scale became more adequate to the objective of evaluating Facebook dependence.", "Limitations of the study: (a) the execution of the project through an institution providing care at no cost may have introduced specific sociodemographic biases. (b) the lack of any similar instrument to allow us to make comparisons.", "Future studies may perfect the original model, making it more accurate and effective.", "CONCLUSION Statistical results showed that the items in the final version of the scale presented alignment between them, qualifying it as adequate to measure Facebook dependence, now validated, with 18 items. New research using the present scale will allow the expansion of its validity for the evaluation of dependence of Facebook users, in addition to allowing comparisons between the results of different research reports.", "AUTHOR CONTRIBUTION:", "E Guedes: reviewed the literature, applied the scales and wrote this article.

There is no specifically validated scale to evaluate the interactivity of the individual with the cellphone, as to duration and frequency of use, behaviors and symptoms. At present, there is a need for an evaluation scale directed to this subject, which can be applied individually to assess dependence and lead to solutions, regarding all aspects of the problem. Research results have been limited due to the lack of a specific validated instrument for the cellphone. Creating such a scale i.e. an instrument recognizable by all professionals in the field, may contribute to future studies investigating dependence and promote conscious cellphone use, thereby reducing harm and improving quality of life. At the time of writing health professionals are witnessing in their practices , an ever increasing flow of complaints of possible “pathological” relationships with cellphones; this problem must be better investigated whenever cellphone use deviates from the natural relationship of comfort and convenience. The objective of this study is the validation of a scale to evaluate cellphone dependence9, checking its psychometric properties in terms of accuracy and reliability. We intend to construct an instrument that can define the profile of subjects who use the cellphone only for leisure or work and differentiate them from those who may have acquired a mental disorder10 associated with its use. We hope our labors may improve service and provide appropriate treatment and guidance for both normal and abnormal conditions.", "MATERIALS AND METHODS The validation of the scale to evaluate cellphone dependence was performed in 5 phases: (1) construction of an initial scale with 20 questions; (2) evaluation by specialists; (3) application of the scale to 200 volunteers, namely a Main Group (n = 100) with abusive use of the cellphone and a Control Group (n = 100), without such abusive use; (4) statistical analysis; (5) - elaboration of a final validated version. In order for a scale to be validated, it is necessary to develop a content rigorously aligned with the subject and the research objectives and then to request its evaluation by a group of specialists. These specialists, trained in the area of digital dependence11 and based on previously published studies, constructed an initial scale with 20 questions and submitted them for evaluation by other six specialists qualified to analyze the content in terms of presentation, clarity, pertinence and understanding.", "There is no consensus regarding the number of specialists who should participate in the validation of a scale, the definition of this number being at the discretion and accessibility of the researcher. However, the greater the number of spec ialists, the greater the disagreement; conversely, the smaller the number (less than 3) the greater the risk of agreement being one hundred percent. In the initial version of the scale we put together 20 questions; dependence was ranked in three levels: mild, moderate and severe dependence. Each question afforded three possible replies: Never/Rarely (0 points); Often (1) and Always (2). Volunteers were asked to insert the corresponding response value next to each question. The scored points should be added so as to allow each person to receive a dependence rank. For validation, we obtained demographic data, namely (a) age, (b) gender, (c) employment and (c) degree of education; this information was only used to identify the selected volunteers.", "Factor analysis was used for the orthogonal model. The method used was Principal Components based on Spearman’s correlation matrix. For data analysis we used the “dplyr” .13 “psy” .14 “paran” 15 packages into R statistical program, version 3.4.2. 16 Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria.", "Volunteers tested of the scale were people who came to our facility with a history of abusive (long hours) cellphone use and other technologies. Students, employees, patient companions, as well as anyone who agreed to participate. Volun teers were recruited through posters at the institution, person to person communication, both verbal or through social networks. Participants should be aged between 16 and 65 years and have a cellphone device with internet access. The initial 20 question scale was applied, as previously noted, to two groups: Main (n = 100) with abusive cellphones use, and Controls (n = 100) without such abusive use. Main group volunteers should have scored ≥ 50 points in the Internet Addiction Test (IAT) scale.12 Another c riterion for inclusion in the Main Group was an admission of abusive cellphone use, whether to speak, consult the Internet, send messages through social networks or to play games. Control Group volunteers should have scored < 50 points in the IAT scale12 and make use of the cellphone only when necessary to make calls or read/send messages.", "Exclusion criteria for both groups included illiterate people and people with any kind of mental impairment that would have prevented the use of cellphones.", "In the Main Group we were able to use 95 out of 100 volunteers and in the Control Group 90 out of 100 were kept. Volunteers discarded in both groups presented incomplete scales, discontinued participation or were unaccompanied minors. Completed results were entered into a database for statistical analysis. RESULTS Table 1 displays the results of descriptive statistics, showing absolute numbers and their respective percentages. Scores for the 20 original question scale . The main group scored 20.2 ± 6.7, while the control group scored 9.6 ± 6.7. The t-statistic was 10.77, characterizing a highly significant difference (p <0.001) between the groups. This difference ratifies the characteristics of the main group presenting dependence whereas the control group present no such dependence.", "Factor analysis. In order to verify the adequacy of the factorial analysis, two tests were performed. The Bartlett’s sphericity tested verified correlation of the variables and produced a p < 0.001, indicating existence of excellent correlation between the variables. The Kaiser -Meyer -Olkin (KMO) criterion produced a value of 0.887; Any value above 0.8 is considered good.17 Due to these two results, we decided that it would be appropriate to perform the factorial analysis for the questionnaire. We used three criteria: Factorial Load, Screeplot and Parallel Analysis.", "Table 2 shows the factorial loads which allowed us to determine the number of relevant factors.", "It is recommended to use factorial loads whose cumulative results exceed 0.9, (0.8 in the worse scenario).17 However, for our data set, we would have to limit ourselves to 10 questions, which in practice would not solve the problem of adequate data reduction. We then proceeded to the Screeplot criterion of the correlation matrix, which allowed to eliminate questions related to Eigenvalues greater than 1, as shown in Figure 1.", "Figure 1. Screeplot.", "it should be noted in the chart the components in which the points are above the red line and whose variance is greater than 1, because these are the components you consider relevant (Table 3).", "It is clear that 4 of the 20 questions of the initial version should be withdrawn because they have a value below 0.5, considered low and not significant17. Therefore, 16 questions were left in the final version. This problem will be taken up in the discussion. The third criterion used to find the number of factors was the Parallel Analysis. By this criterion, the number of factors found was equal to 2, as we see in the table with the commonalities presented below (Table 4). The problem encountered when using parallel analysis is that commonalities are very low, with only 9 questions reaching the minimum value of 0.5.", "Thus, after the analyzes we opted for the Screeplot result that pointed to the withdrawal of 4 items from the scale. The last step of the study was to calculate Cronbach’s alpha,17 in order to measure the internal consistency of the questionnaire. The value found was 0.897, which is considered very good.17 This means that the questions of the scale are aligned with each other, qualifying it as positive to measure the dependence on the cellphone.", "DISCUSSION A final validated scale was constructed with the purpose of being used in clinical practice which fully met what was proposed, namely the evaluation of dependence to the cellphone. This required five stages to be completed, which in turn pointed the way to final adjustments. These were performed after expert approval and statistical analysis.", "Upon completion of the evaluation of the initial 20-question scale by the six experts, all points of agreement and disagreement were verified for each question and a consensus was reached, suggesting the withdrawal of four apparently irrelevant questions. Statistical analysis of the commonalities carried out on the initial 20 questions confi rmed the removal of the same four questions, because of low (< 0.5), non- significant values. The excluded questions were:17 “How often did you feel some kind of physical discomfort, such as a tightness in the chest, a sore throat, palpitation, shortness of breath or dizziness when you realize that you were without your cellphone?” The question had been initially proposed because it occurred in two reports,18,19 where it related to a pathological dependence on cellphones,3 namely the presence of such symptoms in the absence of the device.", "“How often did you feel devalued when you realized that your friends received more cellphone calls or messages than you did?” This question was present in reports20,21 which found that increases or reductions of self-esteem could sometimes be related to comments and posts in social networks.", "“How often did you feel unsafe without the cellphone at hand or when you ran out of battery or found yourself out of range?” This had been included based on studies1,22 showing that individuals with some mental disorders23 associated with cellphone dependence felt insecure when for any reason they were unable to communicate through the device.", "“How often do you have the cellphone in your hands and feel you have company?” This question was inserted because studies9,18,24 suggested the individuals felt they had company (hence felt secure) with the cellphone in hands. Guimarães et al25 in a study on scale validation required an instrument able to specifically assess heart rate anxiety as an essential tool. We did not consider it appropriate to evaluate something so specific through a general instrument; we rather preferred a scale to evaluate the daily interaction of individuals vis-à-vis the cellphone.", "As a limitation of the study, we came across an absence of specific validated instruments capable of investigating behavior using a cellphone on a day -to-day basis, which might have helped us in the preparation of the present scale. Thus, we could only rely on the IAT12, which evaluates general dependence on the Internet: this we very successfully used for our preliminary identification of who should be in the Main or Control groups.", "Future studies are recommended so that we can refine the research in all areas and especially on the subject of digital dependence,11 a very scarcely explored, but so necessary theme in today’s world. We are now , all of us, witnesses of very young children26 interacting with cellphones without sufficient concern of parents or guardians regarding the potential physical and emotional problems7 that may be lurking in the future.", "CONCLUSION The results obtained provided a validated final version of a Scale to Evaluate Cellphone Dependence (CPDS) with 16 clear, accurate and reliable questions, appropriate to clinical contexts. After all the analyzes performed upon the initial scale with 20 questions, 4 questions were considered irrelevant; this ensured a more qualified final version.", "Statistical results showed that the questions kept in the final version of the CPDS showed alignment among them, qualifying the complete scale as adequate to measure cellphone dependence. The final version can be used as a pioneer scale to evaluate cellphone dependence whenever a specific research of this nature is required. We recommend that the study be replicated in a larger sample and representative of the target population.", "AUTHOR CONTRIBUTION ALS King: planned, reviewed the literature, applied the scales, worked with the database and wrote the article.

The term alienation designates repressed contents of consciousness and also, states of depersonalization in which the feeling and awareness of reality are strongly diminished", "According to the DSM -V (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of", "Mental Disorders) ADHD (Attentio n Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder) is classified among neurodevelopmental disorders, which are characterized by developmental difficulties that manifest early and their symptoms must appear before 12 years of age (APA, 2014). It can influence personal, social, academic or personal functioning. There is currently no classification of the disorder in relation to symptoms. The traditional subtypes of ADHD, predominantly inattentive, predominantly hyperactive - impulsive and combined (AMERICAN PSYCHIATRIC ASSOCIATION, 2000) are considered as presentations in the DSM -V (AMERICAN PSYCHIATRIC ASSOCIATION, 2013).", "In today’s world, digital practices are present in virtually every moment of human life, contributing strongly to the distraction and dispersion of attention. It is possible that the phenomenon of Virtual Alienation promoted by the abusive use and excessively focused on digital media is providing some influence on people with ADHD, in its three subtypes.", "The purpose of this article is to describe the influence of Virtual Alienation in individuals with ADHD, particularly in the amplification and reinforcement of this symptom in these people, through the literature on the referred disorder. The discussion that Virtual Alienation causes ADHD is not part of this objective, but the perspective of those who already have this disorder, may have expanded it from the presence of Virtual Alienation. Method From the keywords, Alienation; Virtual Alienation; ADHD; Virtual Alienation in Human Behavior, searches were carried out in the PubMed, PsycoInfo and ISI Web of Science databases during the period from 01/10/2019 to 03/15/2020, aiming to find articles related to those words, with a maximum of six years of publication and with text in the English language wit hout restrictions to the nationalities of the authors. The search resulted in the summary of Table 1, which presents the articles indicated by the aforementioned databases as the first search. Then, the examinations of the Abstracts and the contents of the selected articles as described above, established the numbers of the second search whose articles were effectively used as valid contents of this review, as shown in the table below.", "Results The searches in the bases of PubMed, ISI Web of Science and PsycINFO initially presented 415 articles. Initially were excluded in the analysis by their titles 106 articles resulting in 309 articles. The analysis of Abstracts eliminated another 254 with 55 remaining. Of these, after full reading of the contents of the articles, 43 were excluded, leaving 12 articles in the final analysis, which is the sum of 7 articles extracted from PubMed with 5 PsycInfo articles, presented in the table totals 1. The main characteristics of the 12 articles included in the qualitative synthesis are described in Table 2, right after the descriptive report of the findings on each selected keyword, below:", "Alienation and Virtual Alienation The exacerbated focus with which people get involved with digital media put them in a state of alienation from other people and their surroundings. It is a state of lethargy, of exclusion from the environment in which they are, which places them on a virtual plane disconnected from their surroundings. Recent literature has explored the process of global change associated with social, technological and time -saving relationships, as well as relationships and their times. As a result, social practices are changing due to technologies such as the Internet and its new temporal relationships [3]. Teens are spending more and more time with online access. Although it has many benefits, there are also risks related to overuse, as Internet addiction is associated with depression, attention deficit, hyperactivity and other disorders [4]. Negative impacts are created by the abusive and accelerated use of the Internet affecting the attention and work and academic performance, family life, social relationships, physical health and psychological well -being [5]. This practice can contribute to the wandering and alienation of users in the accelerated search that further reinforces the hyperactive and impulsive profile of people with ADHD.", "According to Gonçalves it is necessary to observe this acceleration and try to discern the differences between digital time and human time [6]. Digital time tends to be increasingly shorter due to technological developments. Human time is not necessarily equal to digital time, due to human limitations and perverting it can create unnecessary discomfort for man.", "Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder - ADHD Children with ADHD have an increased risk of the effects of negative experiences on sleep, academic performance, attention and cognitive profile. The suspicious symptoms of ADHD are found in relation to the access of digital media are among the facts that mediate these negative effects [7].", "ADHD is a neurobiological disorder characterized by three basic symptoms:", "inattention, impulsivity and hyperactivity that interferes with development. It is highly correl ated with other disorders such as Oppositional Defiant Disorder (TOD), Conduct Disorder (CT) and mood symptoms. The diagnosis of ADHD in later years of preschool showed the same stability for school -age children [8]. ADHD is the most common neurobehavioral disorder during childhood, affecting approximately 3 to 6% of school -age children. Its main symptoms of hyperactivity, impulsive activities and distractions in behavior can be assumed to have intimate relationships with interferences in motor skills. A part of the literature points to paths with motor problems that can severely impact children’s daily lives, with motor problems occurring in 30 to 50% of children with ADHD [9]. Valença and Nardi point out that this symptomatic triad can complicate various aspects of the individual’s life, but it can be modified over the years, and these symptoms can either decrease or increase, showing themselves to be very flexible [10]. That is, a child who presents with the type of attention deficit and hyperactivity may in adult life show impulsive or combined traits. Digital activity, due to its increasing speed, can intensify an ADHD behavior, at least with regard to the referred speed and intensification of activities and excessive focus [11].", "On the other hand, the excessive use of computers can be due to the individual’s insecurity, generating an uncontrolled impulse, (impulsivity) characterizing dependence, becoming a tool for the construction of a psychotic universe [12]. The detailing of the behaviors that de fine ADHD can to facilitate the understanding about the possible connection of this disorder with Virtual Alienation, as described below:", "Inattention and Attention Deficit According to DSM -V (2013), inattention and attention deficit have very specific characteristics that allow their identification due to certain behaviors, such as: (a) Failure to pay attention to detail; (b) Difficulties to maintain sustained attention to tasks; (c) The individuals does not seem to hear when talking to him directly; (d) Often does not follow instructions or fails to complete tasks; (e) Has difficulty organizing tasks or activities; (f) Often misses things necessary to perform tasks; (g) Is easily distracted by external stimuli; (h) Often overlooked in daily activities.", "As a neurodevelopmental disorder manifests itself at the beginning of school age, producing personal, social, academic and occupational functional weaknesses, accompanied by appropriate intervention by parents and educators, it contributes in a relevant way at school, in family and social interactions, collaborating preventively in the face of future commitments related to the disorder [13]. As the prevalence of ADHD in children is significant, it is important to study possible negative contributions from the digital practices of children in contact with the digital world, in the amplification of hyperactive, impulsive and attention deficit behaviors.", "Hyperactivity The DSM -V (2013) defines hyperactivity as agitated, often unjustified behavior, characterizing hyperactive people as human beings who cannot stand still, such as: (a) Moves limbs frequently or moves in the chair; (b) Gets up frequently in places where he is expected to remain seated; (c) Runs or climbs excessively on things; (d) Has difficulty playing calmly; (e) It is often “about to” and looks “running on an engine”; (f) Speaks excessively.", "Impulsivity Similarly, in DSM -V impulsivity is identified when a person cannot control himself and has impulses that are incompatible with the moment or the scenario in which they are immersed. Even knowing the consequences of untimely and unreasonable actions, he takes a position of uncontrollable impulses that can harm himself and others, such as: (a) Explodes in answers before the questions are complete d; (b) Has difficulty waiting for his turn; (c) Often interrupts others. The presence and manifestation of the rapid response with impulsivity is proven to be present in children with ADHD [14].", "Although the discovery of ADHD predates the Digital Age, in particular the current phase, amplified by the mobility of the fusion of the cell phone with the Internet, it is possible to connect hyperactivity and impulsivity to the speed requirements of digital practices in relation to its users. This can cause great er acceleration in the functional process of children, adolescents and adults.", "Virtual Alienation Influencing Adhd According to the citations of authors presented in this work, on behaviors aligned with the definitions of Virtual Alienation, it is possible to observe that such behaviors are aligned with the characteristics of ADHD, which can influence and contribute to the reinforcement of this disorder. Detailing the proposal in Table 1, below, the column on the left, on the quotes of authors, shows definitions for alienation used here, while the column on the right describes characteristics of ADHD that relate, respectively, to each of the citations. ADHD characteristics are being corroborated by the authors’ citations.", "Discussion The results found in this systematic review revealed the extent to which people are becoming increasingly involved in the use of digital devices, characterizing the excessive use of technologies and, as a result, showing a state of alienation in relation to the real world due to excessive focus or concentration in the virtual world. Internet use has grown to approximately two billion users, making it common for all age groups. Excessive use and without guidance can generate negative impacts of physical, psychological and social dimensions as well as some material aspects and development of children’s well -being [16]. Exposing children to screens offers the potential to become dependent behavior, as they are flooded with levels of sensory stimulation at increasingly younger ages [17]. This type of stimulation in children with ADHD dissociates them from the real world, imposing on them virtual speeds beyond their cognitive abilities, accentuating characteristics of this disorder. Internet addiction, due to its excessive use, represents an emerging global health issue, dramatically transforming the way of living, with greater incidences on children [18 -21]. This whole scenario scenario should arouse the attention of Psychology in terms of studying these new behaviors of people, interpreting them and trying to understand them in order to deal with them properly. Considering that the research field of this discipline is interested in human behavior and mainly in its transformations, this work brings a theme that can contribute to the expansion of Psychology as a vital discipline for the improvement of humanity.", "As for the limitat ions of this research, the novelty of the Virtual Alienation theme should be highlighted due to the very emergence of the digital age to transform people in various aspects. These limitations are due to the difficulties in obtaining content that addresses this matter head -on, without, however, making this production unfeasible. On the contrary, it reveals a new perspective on human behavior, specifically ADHD from the perspective of Virtual Alienation, now influenced by a vector derived from new human pract ices from the digital world.", "Conclusions The characteristics of ADHD, as shown mainly in table 1, are related to the definitions of Virtual Alienation and can be influenced by this type of alienation, considering that attention deficit, impulsivity and hyperactivity, characteristic trio of ADHD disorder, can be amplified with the digital practices that cause Virtual Alienation. The phenomenon of Virtual Alienation can interfere with ADHD disorder mainly for its expansion, as this work intended to demonstrate. New studies should be carried out in research with main and control groups to expand this perspective.", "Financing The research was developed with the authors’ own resources.", "Thanks Delete Laboratory - Digital Detox and Conscious Use of Technology@s", "IPUB / UFRJ - Institute of Psychiatry, Federal University of Rio de Janeiro FAPERJ - Carlos Chagas Filho Foundation for Research Support of the State of Rio de Janeiro.", "References", "1.

From 2002, there was an increase in the use of both worldwide, reaching in 2012 almost 40% of internet users in the world population and more than 90 mobile phone sub - scriptions per 100 inhabitants.", "Current overview In the fourth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM -4),3 there was no recognition of any technology dependence as a distinct diagnosis, being allowed only inclusion of internet addiction in the diagnostic section of “Impulse Control, No Other Specification”, without criteria for its definition and formal diagnosis. However, in the fifth edition (DSM -5),4 more precisely in section III of the chapter “Conditions for Further Study” pro- posed criteria are described for what the manual calls “Internet Gaming Disorder”. It demonstrates the need observed by the American Psychiatric Association (APA) for the improvement of studies and technical - scientific investments in the area of digital dependency. The understanding of the parameters of behaviors, risks and consequences of the use and abuse before them will enable the development of healthy habits, better use of the benefits provided and less impairment in socio - occupational, personal and environmental life. It is important to differentiate between the usual and necessary use of technologies - people who say they are dependent on having work needs for research or other work issues or for the convenience of quick contact with family and co-workers throughout the day; and harmful use - when there are significant socio -occupational losses and undesirable consequences. There is a need to evaluate the use of these technol - ogies in certain sectors of society. The use of the smart - phone with internet access and digital devices are considered indispensable tools in academic training, which has been fostered by research practices since the beginning and requires more technology to improve techniques and dynamism in learning. Talking about a population that works directly and indirectly with the use of technology in daily practice: would it be more predisposed to harmful use inside and outside the workplace? Literature has been working to study digital dependency in patients, aiming to better understand the subject and to discu ss interventionist practices. What if it is the time to discuss this worrying subject between health professionals?", "Impact of smartphone usage in healthcare It is important to note that with the explosion of smart - phone applications, there was a greater possibility of rapid communication among health professionals and quick access to useful information that facilitates and improves the practice of patient care. However, smart - phone use in healthcare settings may be dangerous and cause infractions to the code of health professional’s ethics (such as negligence or imprudence), consequently and more important, cause damage to patient health.5 Health professionals in patient care need to be atten tive to the performance of their activities. Smartphones are elements of distraction, their use in service can cause inattention and errors in their proce dures causing harm to their patients.6", "Smartphone addiction and social media apps In the face of smartphone social media apps, statistics from Facebook7 on 30 June 2017 reveal that the daily average is 1.32 billion active people (1.15 billion people in mobile devices), reaching monthly numbers of 2.01 billion active users. Compared to other social media platforms, more than 1 billion people in more than 180 countries used WhatsApp.8 Instagram now has more than 600 million users worldwide who capture and share more than 95 million moments daily.9 Twitter10 has 328 million users monthly active world - wide; and Snapchat now has access to more than 173 million daily users (more than 300 million active users monthly), who view about 10 billion videos per day.11 This represents an increase of more than 350% only in the last year. This data shows how much communication has changed between people in the pres ent century and how much people resort and may be dependent on electronic devices. In the streets, in restaurants or in any public environment we can see how much general people are hold - ing a smartphone or other electronic device. What about in hospitals or other care scenarios? How dangerous can it be? The purpose of this review article is to discuss the studies found in the literature that aim to characterize the dependence of smartphones with health professionals, as well as any information that helps in the understanding and elaboration of diagnos - tic criteria, screening and the formulation of a specific theory about the subject matter.", "Methods An electronic search was performed ending August 2019. It was used of electronic databases (PubMed, Web of Science and PychoInfo) was employed using the Boolean operator ‘AND’ to combine keyword “Smartphone addiction’’ or “Smartphone dependence”", "or “Smartphone abuse” with the following terms: ‘‘physicians’’, “nurses” and ‘‘health professionals”.

The reference lists of these selected articles were also includ - ed in the search. Between the 19 articles included there were 5 repeated. Only articles in English and focused on smartphone usage by health professionals were included. The figure 1 above shows this process.", "Results Healthcare scenario and smartphone use: Benefits versus ill effects In 2014, Peter J Papadakos12 in his article “Electronic distractions of the respiratory therapist and their impact on patient safety” described that, in the last decade, the explosion of personal electronic devices (PED) and social networking applications changed the way people communicate. The article was charac - terized as a watershed for concerns about the abusive use of technologies in healthcare environments. A 2011 New York Times article called “Distracted Physician” by Matt Richtel drew attention to the fact that several health organizations should be concerned about this problem, mainly because it affects the health of patients, and thus mobilized them to create protocols and guidelines to encourage the conscious use of tech - nologies in the health environment during professional practice. Distractions from smartphones and mobile devices were among the top 10 items for caregivers in the United States in 2013, according to the annual list of technology risks from the Emergency Care Research Institute (ECRI). The author cites that in The Critical Care Medicine of The University of Rochester (New York) they use the process of self awareness to elec - tronic addiction to health care professiona ls and public - one of the tools they uses The University of Rochester’s modified CAGE questionnaire.12 The questionnaire has been useful and highly validated screening for alcohol abuse. It has a great acceptance and comprehensiveness. The questionnaire enables each one to review their own habits in order to regulate the abusive use of PED in the professional environment and motivates a discussion on the subject. The author considers that an electronic etiquette and an education on electronic distraction is needed to minimize prob - lems between healthcare personnel and patients’ fami - lies. The preservation of human observational skills that are being changed by electronic tools and facilities is considered paramount by the author.12 In 2015, Sumi Cho and Eunjoo Lee13 published a development of a brief instrument to measure smart - phone addiction among nursing students. This instru - ment covers 4 factors: withdrawal, tolerance, interference with daily routines and positive expecta - tions. This scale is about 18 items (19 previously) with demonstrated reliability and validity. This study demonstrated that nursing students who had more answers, which suggests smartphone addiction tended to be distracted at work and also to disagree with establishing smar tphones education policies in health - care scenario.13 One year later, the same Authors14 published an assessment of 312 third -year nursing stu - dents’ smartphone use by a self -report questionnaire. Almost half of the students confirmed they used smart - phones a couple of times and about a quarter were sometimes distracted by the usage.", "Additionally, the majority of them had already experienced nurses with this behavior during their work.", "In 2016, JP Attri et al.15 published a review article with guidelin es regarding use of smartphones in oper - ating room and critical care scenario. In one hand, this review demonstrated various smartphones’ apps bene - fits in healthcare practices. The fast access to treatment guidelines and searches, as well as the fast ac cess to procedures or laboratory results, minimizes the need for tools in medical practice, permitting intercommuni - cation between health professionals. It can possibly lead to improvement on health care and help patients cope with diseases. In other hand, the article pointed out disadvantage of the use of these devices and estab - lished some recommendations about the safe use of them. The authors stand out only about 2 -3% of people can actually multitask and devices can hurt cognitive performance as well as interfere with the medical equipment.15 Some of the studies excluded16–19 on this review showed different measurement for Smartphone addiction/dependence.", "However, these referred articles do not explored this addictive behavior on health profession als and for that reason were not included on this present review.", "Mobile health (mHealth) apps In 2013, Corazza, O. et al.20 published an article about The Recreational Drugs European Network Project (ReDNet project), that shows efficacy of technology -based forms of intervention on novel psychoactive substances (NPS) by recognizing products online (at its end identified 650 NPS and combinations) and publishing relevant information through some technological appliances to young people, profess ionals and European Union/International agencies. They con - tributed to national policy makers, advices to general people and health care professionals. It also concluded that web - monitoring activities are fundamental in this subject and technological tools can be successfully incorporated in specific prevention schemas.20 One year later, in 2014, Deborah S Hasin, Efrat Aharonovich, and Eliana Greenstein21 affirmed mobile technologies are a great ally in patients care and can make clinical practice faster and keep its efficiency. The authors analyzed the feasibility and acceptability of HealthCall for the smartphone (HealthCall -S) instead of Interactive voice response (HealthCall -IVR) – these technologies were proposed after brief interventions in HIV alcohol dependent patients. They highlighted that in the future, technologies may emerge offering features even more advanta - geous than the smartphone. HealthCall -S was very acceptable and there was a better patient engagement in the study’s compariso n. The authors suggested this technology could strengthen self -awareness, motivation and self-efficacy.21 In 2015, Carpenter, V. L. et al.,22 published an arti - cle about smoking cessation treatment to homeless people by a smartphone app intervention. He conclud - ed it can be a feasible tool in clinical practice instead of psychiatric comorbidities shown on this population’s study. The app demonstrated great adherence and was considered an useful intervention. In the same year, Rosa, C. et al.,23 provides a general overview of the use of e - technologies in clinical trials research for recruitment, retention and data collection, dissemination of study results and for interventions such as prevention and treatment; and its advantages, challenges and limitation s – as ethical standards and patient privacy. This article demonstrated how clinical trials have been slow in using these technologies and ensure great possibilities of improvement on clinical trials while reducing costs.23 In 2015, Pereira -Azevedo N et al.,24 published an article analyzing the participation of health professionals and Urology associations in development of Urology Mobile Health (mHealth) apps. He concluded there is a lack of specialist’s participation (principally on those targeted to pa tients) and lack of regulation. More than a half was free and targeted to health professionals. The authors cited mHealth can represent an essential tool in the future and can be an opportunity to improve patient’s care. The mHealth systems were also analy zed Systematic Literature Review in terms of usability. They concluded there is a need of adapting Healtlh apps to users need and usability could be upgraded by the introduction of automated mechanisms. In the same year, Mahajan, A., Bal, S. & Hahn, H.26 analized a free smartphone app for physicians to eval - uate proper use criteria for Myocardial perfusion imag - ing and its feasibility in clinical practice. The authors found relevance on using this app in reducing health - care costs and inappropriate radi ation burden to patients. In 2015, Parker C.27 published an article that emphasizes how smartphones and websites can be used in the conduct of treatment or procedures used in obstetrics. The author mentioned efforts were made with the help of electronic devices to avoid new trauma in a patient with posttraumatic stress disorder by Rape trauma syndrome.", "In 2016, Davis, T. L., DiClemente, R., & Prietula, M.,28 focused on Health’s core characteristics (penetra - tion into populations; availability of apps; wireless broadband access to the Internet; and tethered to indi - viduals). The authors emphasized smartphones are becoming more accessible, but there are still differences between regions around the world and between people - cultural and economic pattern. They also point out differences between mobile phones functionalities, sup - posed to be unlimited in the future. They ensure that if mHealth is correctly used, well adapted to individual’s behavior and life, health goals can be reached. However, health pr ofessionals need to be ready for this type of smartphone application, which is evolving from moment to moment and improving health care.28 In 2016, Mares, M.L. et al.29 published an article focused on implementation of an mHealth system, named Seva, for substance use disorders in primary care. The authors examined the initial perspectives of", "53 physicians in the first year of", "implementation of Seva, a smartphone application that provides information on tracking and relapsing patients’ health through a web portal called the Clinical Report, which at the same time, helps patients with online support, discussion, health tracking and tools to deal with patients’ wishes. They concluded that patients tend to use it and receive valuable information by the app. However physicians are less leaning to monitor patients by their workload. There were concerns about efficiently monitoring patients’ interactions online in face of physician’s reluctance to engage with such a system that was used by behavioral health care providers and the addiction - focused Health Promotions team which perceived substantial benefits.29 The other studies excluded30–35 on this review were not about Smartphone use/addiction by health professionals.", "Discussion The concern about the harmful use of smartphones by health professionals is still not a topic of great scientific interest, considering the few articles12–15 found in the review that deal with this subject, despite the relevance of the topic highlighted by the few that approach it. These articles showed the lack of specific trial instru - ments on the screening of smartphone addiction or abusive use, tending to adoption of different diagnostic criteria by the reports included. As the subject is still new in the scientific environ ment, and still not well investigated or understood, there are also a lack of studies discussing etiology of this compulsive behavior (none of the articles included). Few studies are about the need to create guidelines for prevention, diagnosis and treatme nt of health professionals with this behavior. Published reports included show there is no consciousness of abusive use and possible damages in health care by some health professionals.13,14 The concepts of abusive use and dependence comes from the studies of chemical dependence, which is why they are still described today only in the definitions of related disorders. Can any compulsive behavior be understood as an addiction?", "Of course it is essential to adopt a more sensible, evidence based policy towards mobile phone usage in our clinical practice with great caution, owing to clearly known benefits.15 Politics and education on smart - phone usage should be taken in college, before becoming health professionals, aiming to enhance the quality of Health Care and patient safety.13 An awareness about the risks of smartphone use is necessary in aca - demic and hospital settings to improve health care and prevent infractions to the code of health professional ethics (such as negligence or imprudence). In addition to the need of developing policies that encourage smart and safe use of smartphones during clinical practice,12,14 associated with the development of privacy policies on smartphone apps.23,28,29 Most of the studies20–29 today still focus on highlighting the benefits guaranteed by smartphone technology in clinical practice, focusing on health applications for smartphones and its benefits in patient care and in clinical decision or treatment. They also highlight the importance of improving the applications for patients needs and adherence. Can it represent a possible motivation for a future addiction behavior?

A alternativa virtual permite alcançar maior número de indivíduos e tornar as amostras mais maiores quantitativamente e, port anto, mais significantes .", "O desconhecimento dos usuários quanto às consequências para sua Saúde Mental, quanto ao uso não consciente de tecnologias, é também um dificultador e aqui reside um segmento importante para pesquisadores neste tema no sentido de p esquisar e divulgar intensivamente a Dependência Digital e seus desdobramentos.", "8.2. Âmbito Organizacional", "O desconhecimento sobre a Dependência Digital por parte dos líderes organizacionais que, em geral, consideram apenas os benefícios das tecnologia s digitais sem se preocupar com a forma de uso, é um limitador e mais uma vez, a disseminação de pesquisas, estudos e práticas deve ser intensificado nos ambientes organizacionais.", "Um outro aspecto importante é o receio dos empregados sobre sigilo de suas respostas, ainda que lhes seja assegurado o sigilo pelo anonimato com relação aos respondentes.", "8.3. Âmbito das Publicações", "O limitado número de revistas específicas sobre Dependência Digital dificulta muito a expansão rápida da produção acadêmica sobr e o tema. As bases de dados acadêmicas apresentam baixo número de artigos sobre Dependência Digital relativamente ao total que elas abrigam. O conhecimento limitado dos revisores de revistas sobre o tema retarda, e muito, a análise e aceitação ou rejeição, do artigo submetido. Falta de escalas específicas que atendam nossos objetivos de pesquisa, o que nos obriga a criar novos instrumentos de coleta usando todos os passos recomendados para esta construção de escalas.", "9. Conclusões", "A Introdução deste trabalho situou conceitualmente a Dependência Digital e a Dependência Digital Organizacional como forma de alinhamento ao Projeto de Tese de Doutor ado, eixo vital para entendimento do trabalho.

Esta sessão retrata a estrutura do trabalho e sua conclusão dentro do contexto da Dependência Digital e em particular no âmbito organizacional, sempre alinhado ao compromisso assumido no projeto de Tese e utilizando os resultados até aqui obtidos.", "10. Considerações finais", "O avanço natural no uso digital oportuniza a ampliação de estudos relativos a forma com que os seres humanos fazem uso dos mesmos oferecendo rico conteúdo para novos achados e enriquecimento dos que até se tem notícia. Aspectos como maior número de mulheres participando das pesquisas sobre Dependên cia Digital ou ainda o desinteresse das faixas etárias extremas, além de outros aspectos que serão investigados nos próximos anos. Em resumo, foi mantido o alinhamento à proposta do Projeto original com ganhos de novas perspectivas. Os Resultados quantitativos demonstram relevância para aprofundamento e asseguram consistente possibilidade de Generalização e a continuidade do uso das escalas criadas bem como seus desdobramentos e resultados.", "A contribuição para a linha de pesquisa Dependência Digita l nos encoraja a continuar neste segmento e a nosso ver o compromisso de Projeto de Tese foi cumprido.", "Para os próximos anos deverão ser empreendidas:", "a) Continuidade das pesquisas e produção de novos artigos; b) Integração de dados (Revisões/Meta -análises e Pes quisas transversais); c) Investigação das correlações dos graus de Dependência Digital (s/DD, Leve, Moderado e Grave) com Dados Demográficos (Gênero, Faixa etária, Escolaridade); d) Prevalência de mulheres nas pesquisas e padrões de faixas etárias extremas.", "e) Pós-Doutorado na linha de Uso Digital Consciente na Saúde Mental."]}

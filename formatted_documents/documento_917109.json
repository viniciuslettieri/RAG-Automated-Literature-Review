However, this process generates abundant residual biomass rich in phenolics compounds that can be reused along GCO to produce biomaterials. Food packaging industry has interest f or biodegradable and bioactive materials to satisfy food products challenges and consumers concern for non - natural additives and ecological impa cts of synthetic materials. The objective of this work was to develop carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) -based films incorporated with GCO and its residue extracts with improved techno -functional properties to protect fish oil from oxidation. The cold pressing process was standardized and GCO and by -products were chemically characterized . The effect of GCO along with the extracts of cake (CE) and sediment (SE) extracts on physicochemical, mechanical, barrier, color, microstructure, and antioxidant properties of CMC films was investigated . Finally, the release of antioxidants compounds from improved films and their capacit y to protect fish oil from oxidation were evaluated. Results showed that the addition of bo th CE and SE at 20 and 40% caused a si gnificant increase of flexibility and decrease of tensile strength of films. FTIR indicated interactions among CMC, phenolic co mpounds, and fatty acids. The film surface was rough and heterogeneous, without compromising the barrier property of active films . Color was affected by the type and concentration of residue extracts with remarkable UV -Vis absorption capacity . In order to produce films with higher techno -functional and antioxidant properties, CE and SE were dried and added to the film forming soluti on (0.5 g/g of CMC). The resulting active films achieved 5-fold higher antioxidant activity against DPPH radical. Globally, the barrier permeability of active films against oxygen and water vapour was not affected by the extracts addition (p >0.05). Films with CE showed greater flexibility, antioxidant activity and release of antioxidants in polar medium, conversely , films with SE showed greater UV -Vis", "absorption, release of antioxidant s in low polarity medium and minor impact on morphology and color. The variations observed in these properties could be explained by the class of bioactive compounds present in each residue, their co ncentration and the interactions with the CMC polymer matrix. As a result of the ef fective barrier ag ainst oxygen and great both UV- Vis absorption capacity and antioxidant activity , the protective effect of active film on fish oil oxidation was highly sati sfacto ry in the form of lids.

In this context, the development of biodegradable polymer -based materials has become an area of interest that could contribute to mitigate the environmental impacts of post -consumer plastic pa ckaging and particularly interesting for short -term applications such as food packaging (Mir, Dar, Wani, & Shah, 2018) . Cellulose is probably the most abundant natural polymer . Among the products obtai ned through chemical modifications of cellulose, carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) is one of the most prominent due to its economic importance as a thickening agent and the variety of applications, which also has the ability to form films with excellent proper ties, as well as being safe for human health and low cost (Ballesteros, Cerqueira, Teixeira, & Mussatto, 2018) . Biodegradable polymers can be functionalized by the inclusion of natural antioxidants and/or antimicrobial agents to protect f ood products from oxidation reactions such as degradation, enzymatic browning, and oxidative rancidity (Moudache, Colon, Nerín, & Zaidi, 2016) . This innovative materials known as “active packaging” may act as a source of an tioxidants that are released to the food at controlled rates, reducing the need of synthetic antioxidants and minimizing the risk of potential toxicity by migration (Gomez -Estaca, Lopez -de-Dicastillo, Hernndez -Muñoz, Catalá, & Gavara, 2014) . Moreover, the antioxidant performance of food packaging materials mainly depends on its barrier properties (esp ecially to oxygen and light) and on the release of antioxidants to the packed foods (Meritaine da Rocha, de Souza, & Prentice, 2018) . Natural antioxidant can be found in proce ssed or discarded agro -industrial residues of fruit and seeds which retain important level of antioxida nts substances (Maryam Adilah, Jamilah, & Nur Hanani, 2018) . Among the natural sources of antioxidant compounds, green coffee beans has aroused i nterest due to the presence of different classes of bioactive compounds, such as phenolic compounds, especially chlorogenic acids (6 - 12%) (Farah & Donangelo, 2006) which have strong antioxidant properties against lipid oxidation (Aguiar, Estevinho, & Santos, 2016) . The lipid fraction (15 –17%) of green Arabica coffee is composed of nearly 75% triacy lglycerols and unique unsaponiafia ble fraction (19%) (Speer & Kölling -Speer, 20 06). By cold", "pressing is obtained green coffee oil (GCO) which has been used as an active cosmetic ingredient in many skin care products, due to its composition and balance of fatty acids (Wagemaker, Carvalho, Maia, Baggio, & Guerreiro Filho, 2011) . Nevertheless, this process leaves abundant residual biomass that remain with an appreciable amount of bioactive compounds, usually neglected by the agroindustry (Oliveira, Da Silva, Santos, In this contex , this interdisciplinary research aims to contribute to studies on biodegrad able polymer matrices incorporated with natural extracts and oils for food pack aging applications. To the best of our knowledge, green coffee oil and its res idues had never been added to functionalize biopolymers. Thus, this work focused on green coffee oil and its resi dues of cold pressing as a source of bioactive compounds, specifically antioxidants, through the extract ion, characteriz ation and incorporation of them into carboxymethyl cellulose based on films in order to obtain materials with improved physico -chemical and functional properties enough to protect food products from oxidation . Moreover, films could be elaborat ed with GCO and its residues extracts from defective beans , which is a promising approach since Brazil is the world´s largest producer and exp orter o f green coffee .", "2.

Biodegradable polymers", "In literature, there has been no consensus on the exact definition o f the generic terms biodegradable, biopolymer, bio -based and oxy -degradable, which appear to have multiple and overlapping meanings. According to t he American Society for Testing of Material (ASTM) and the International S tandards Organization (ISO) degrada ble plastics a re those that undergo a significant change in their chemical structure under specific environmental conditions (ASTM , 1998) . Polymer degradation is a change in physicochemical polymer properties (tensile strength, color, shap e, and others) as a result of environmental factors, such as light, heat, humidity, chemical conditions, or biological activity. These character istics could result in an alteration in the structure and functionality of the polymers as a result of breaking bonds and subsequen t chemical transformations (Kumar, Sandeep, Alavi, & Truong, 2011) . Natural polymers are available in large quantities from renewable s ources, while synthetic polymers are produced from non renewable petroleum resources .", "In this context, differen t biodegradable polymers are being studied to replace, at least partially, petroleum -derived materials. Biodegradable materials can be divided i nto three main groups:", "1.

Naturally occurring biopolymers: obtained from microorganisms, vege tal tissues, and animals.", "Regarding the last group, biopolymers, such as polysaccharides and proteins, can be considered to form different films and coatings whose properties may be tailored to fulfill the conservation requirements of different food produc ts (Akhtar et al., 2018) .", "4.1.1 Polysaccharides: Biopolymers matrices for packaging Polysaccharides have emerged as the main film components because of their abundance and low toxicity (Bitencourt, Fávaro -Trindade, Sobral, & Carvalho, 2014; Talón, Vargas, Ch iralt, & González -Martínez, 2019) . Agar, alginate, carrageenan, cellulose and its derivatives, chitosan, pectin and starch are the main polysacch arides tested as films packaging materials (Williams & Phillips, 2000) . Figure 2 shows the most common bio -polymer materials used for preparation of films grouped into three categories according to their origin.", "Polysaccharides exhibit linear or branched form structured by repet itions of the same or more monosaccharides. Depending on the moiety attached to the Figure 2. Biopolymers used for preparation of films and coatings for food. MC (methyl cellulose), HPC (hydroxypropyl cellulose), CMC (car boxymethyl cellulose), HPMC (hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose) (Adapted from: Ballesteros, 2016).", "monosaccharide, they can find as a neutral, negatively, or positively charged molecules, which could modi fy or differentiate the film forming solution properties, as they c an influence the number of intermolecular bonds between the polymer chains. Moreover, the molecular weight of polysaccharides also plays an important role in the film forming properties (Rodríguez, Martín, Ruiz, & Clares, 2016) . Generally , films based on these biopolymers have moderate gas barrier properties, because of their t ightly packed and ordered hydrogen -bonded network structure (Sanchez -Gonzalez, Chifer, Gonzalez -Martínez, Chiralt, & Desobry, 2011) , good mechanical strength, an d they are edible and readily degradable. Nevertheless , they have s ome undesirable characteristics such as hydrophobicity or brittle (Tavassoli , Shekarchizadeh, & Maso udpour , 2016) . To improve these disadvantages , polymeric matrix can be incorporated with hydrophobic substances, fillers , other hydrocolloids or bioactive compounds . These ingredients may affect the general performance of the material, hence extensive characterization is advisable (Fabra, Falcó, Randazzo, Sánchez, & Lópe z-Rubio, 2018; Tavassoli et al., 2016) .", "4.1.2 Lipids addition into polysaccharides films", "The use of films obtained from hydrophobic materials is well known because many fruits and vegetables, such as citrics, have been traditionally coated with these compounds (Chiralt & Jiménez, 2016). Unfortunately, the functional properties of waxes and other lipids a re poor, and the incorporation of lipids into polymeric matrices is one of the most useful solutions to reduce their drawbacks and profit their hydrophobicity.", "Waxes, fatty acids, vegeta ble oils, essential oils or its individual component s are the most commons lipids used to incorporate into hydrocolloids films. They are mainly incorporated to reduce the sensitivity of hydrocolloids to moisture, thus reducing their solubility, swelling behavior, a nd water vapor sorption ability (Nur & Nur , 2017) . However , some other properties can be impaired (e.g., mechanical behavior or optical properties) by lipid addition (Tongnuanchan, Benjakul, Prodpran, & Nilsuw an, 2015) . The incorporation of lipids is mainly carried out by direct emulsification (based on high shear forces —rotor stator homogenizers or microfluidification —or sonication) as it can be easily found in the l iterature (Chiralt & Jiménez, 2016).", "4.1.3 Cellulose", "Cellulose is probably the most abundant organic substance existing in nature and is the major constituent of most land plants. It is the starting material for a wide range of modifications with uses bo th in the food industry, and an even greate r vari ety of uses outside this sector (Williams & Phillips , 2000) . Derivates o f cellulose covers the range of modified celluloses generally approved as food additives. These are methyl cellulose E461, hydroxypropyl cellulose E463, hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose E464, methyl ethyl cellulose E465, and sodium carboxymethyl cellulose E4 66 which is frequently called simply carboxymethyl cellulose and also known as cellulose gum. The respective abbreviations MC, HPC, HPMC, MEC and CMC are widely used ( Figure 3) shows the molecular st ructure of CMC .", "4.1.4 Carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC)", "Among the products obtained through chemical modifications of cellulose, carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) is one of the most prominent due to its economic importance as a thickening agent and the variety of applications (Ballesteros et al., 2018) . Carboxymethyl cellulose is a water -soluble derivative industrially obtained from the suspension process of cellulose, sodium hydroxide and monochloric acid. This derivative is generally prepared and used in the form of sodium (CMCNa) which, once dissolved in water, has the typical cha racteris tics of polyelectrolytes. Their properties and applications depend essentially on the viscosity of their aqueous solutions, the average degree of substitution (DS), defined as the average number of hydroxyl groups substituted with D -glycopyranosyl in the p olymer chain, and the distribution of the carboxymethyl groups (Caraschi & Filho, 1999) (Figure 3).", "Figure 3. Sodium carboxymethyl cellulose chemical structure (Adapted from: Lin et", "This last factor, the dis tribution of carboxymethyl groups along the chains, strongly influences its properties, the rheological behavior of the s olutions and the scope of applications. A maximum degree of substitution (ds) of 1.5 is permitted in the EU legislation, but more typic ally (ds) is in the rage 0.6 -0.95 for food applications (Williams & Phillips, 2000) .", "4.1.5 Films based on CMC containing natural compounds and extracts CMC has excellent properties for forming transparent films with good mechanical and barrier properties against oxygen and lip ids (Ghanbarz adeh & Almasi, 2011) . This can be explained by biocompatibility with water soluble substances such as polysaccharides, pro teins, surfactants and plasticizers. However, the presence of many hydroxyl and carboxyl groups allows water and moisture to be abs orbed, affecting the functional properties (Bifani et al., 2007) . Fatty acids can potentially enhance this property in hydrophilic films as it was widely commented above .

The release of substances that involve migration is the result of diffusion, dissolu tion and equilibrium processes (Tawakkal, Cran, & Bigger, 2016) . There are various factors that influence the migration of a substance from the packaging material including the film fabrication method, the vol atility and polarity of the substance, the chemical interaction between the substance and polymer chains, hydrophob icity and hydrophilicity of the polymer as well as food properties and composition (Gómez -Estaca et al., 2014) .", "A suitable selection of the antioxidant compound to be incorporated in the packaging material is crucial.

Once released, the solubility characteristics of the antioxidant can determine its effectiveness, and t herefore the type of antioxidant should be selected as a function of the type of food.

A simplified escheme of lipid oxidation (Adapted from: Wang et", "Globally, the process of lipid oxidation has generally been established as being a free radical mechanism where molecular oxygen and unsaturated fatty acids are combined in the presence of a cataly st, such as iron, copper, enzymes, heat, light, etc., yielding lipid hydroperoxides, also called pri mary oxidation products. Peroxide compounds are reactive and can combine with fats to form additional reactive products during the propagation stage (Pereir a de Abreu et al., 2010). Secondary oxidation products, alkanes, alkenes, aldehydes and ketones, are formed during the final stage from the decomposition of fatty acid hydroperoxides by means of β -scission reactions. These compounds are volatile, and are r esponsible for rancid odor characteristic of decomposed fish. Aldehydes can form cross -links with different compounds such as proteins, thereby hardening muscle tissue. Aldehydes, particularly those with two aldehydic functional groups, such as malondialde hyde and glutaraldehyde, react with amino groups in proteins or DNA, leading to structural damage an d changes in functionality (Addis, 1986). The process of lipid peroxidation can be divided into three stages: initiation, propagation and termination; as it can be observed in figure 5.", "4.5.1 Oil quality indices", "Evaluating lipid oxidation status is a challenging task due to a number of reasons. Firstly, different compounds are formed depending on the time, extent of oxidation and mechanism involved. Therefor e, choosing just one parameter to analyse the oxidative s tatus is rather difficult and it is frequently more convenient to combine different methods. Primary products provide information regarding off -flavor precursors, while secondary products show a dire ct association with compounds related to sample’s sensory characteristics and acceptability.

Lipids containing methylene -interrupted dienes or polyenes show a shift in their double bond position during oxidation. The resulting CD exhibit intense absorption at 232 nm, similarly CT absorb at 270 nm. The increase in CD and CT contents is p roportional to the uptake of oxygen.

The basis of this test is the absorbance of a pink color complex spectrophotometrically at 532 and 535 nm which is formed between thiobarbituric acid and the oxidation pro ducts of unsaturated lipids: the higher the absorbance, the grea ter the amount of TBARS formed, and hence the greater the extent of oxidation.

Moreovers, the aut hors state that the position of esterification does not affect the antiox idant behavior (Xu, Wang, Liu, Yuan, & Gao, 2015) .", "4.5.1 Extraction and identification of chlorogenic acids", "For the purpose of extracting and obtaining highly valuable phenolic antioxidants from coffee processing by -products, the main employed techniques are based on solid –liquid solvent extraction using a range of solvents and maceration or heat/ mixing procedu res. Solvent extraction is very convenient, as the solvent provides a physical carrier to transfer molecules between different phases (i.e., solid, liquid, and vapor) (Mayanga -Torres et al., 2017) . CGA , in general, and the less polar diCQA, in particular, are more soluble in the lower alcohols or alcohol –water mixtures , resulting to different fractions obtained by varying alcohol concentration based on polarity. They are inso luble in benzene, chloroform, and petroleum ether. The diCQA, in addition to the lower alcohols, are well dissolved in ethyl acetate, butyl acetate and acetone (Wianowska and Gil, 2019) . The only disadvantage of hydroethanolic mixtures is that their efficacy is extended to other extractable compounds (e .g., sugar s, organic acids) and thus additional purification steps are required.", "On the other hand, o ne of the significant features of C GA is their chemical instability and formation/degradation to other compounds, including chlorogenic acids representati ves (Dawid owicz & Typek 2017). In the case of CQA one of the characteristic processes responsible for modifying the structure of CQA is acyl migration (Li et al. 2015 ), as well as other chemical changes such as hydrolysis of the", "ester bond, decarboxylation of cinnamoyl moieties, epimerization at the quinic acid, dehydration, lactones formation, and reaction with water or methanol/ethanol (Wianowska and Gil, 2019 ; Clifford 2000; Dawidowicz & Typek 2017 ).", "Unfortunately, the elimination/ limitation of C QA degradation/transformation is not the only problem in the CQA determination in plants or plant products. The number of compounds needed to be identified during a single analysis is steadily increasing, though the number of commercially av ailable standar ds is limited to just a few. There are many analytical methods to identify and quantify chlorogenic acids in natural samples. However, there are no official and universally accepted methods of CQAs analysis. Therefore, many laboratories dev elop and valida te their own analysis methods (Wianowska and Gil, 2019 ). High -performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) is the most widely used analytical separation technique of CQAs. Though the more advanced form of LC i.e. ultra -performance liquid chromat ography (UPLC) utilizing a sub -2-micron analytical column becomes increasingly popular for the determination of plant extract compounds, due to the improved resolution there are obtained shorter retention times and higher sensitivity . In general, LC separa tions of CQA ar e performed by the reversed phase system. The most commonly applied columns are based on C18 stationary phases 0. A typical mobile phase consists of mixtures of methanol and water (Tena et al., 2015) . Detectors used to monitor CQA separation s are diode arr ay detectors (DAD) or photodiode array detectors (PDA) recording at 280, 320 and/or 330 nm (the range of 320 –330 nm is the range of the absorption maximum of cinnamoyl moiety) and scanning from 200 to 600 nm. It should be remembered, however , that only a f ew CQA standards are available commercially, and the precise analysis of the individual CQAs by means of conventional LC –DAD (PDA) systems is not easy due to the difficulty of distinguishing between the positional isomers especially when they are present a t low concentrations. Hence, nowadays most laboratories prefer the use of MS systems, and especially tandem MS, due to their higher selectivity and sensitivity. In order to improve the ionization capacity, formic acid is f requently added to the mobile phas e comprising methanol as the organic modifier. Ionization is usually performed by electrospray ionization (ESI) source working in the negative and positive mode .", "4.6 The lipid fraction of green coffee beans", "Coffee is one of the most popular beverages all over the world. Behind each hot and tasteful cup of coffee, which can be presented by so ma ny different ways, a real journey is hidden. The genus Coffea , which belongs to the Rubiaceae family, embraces two of the more impo rtant plant species of the interna tional coffee trade: Coffea arabica L. and Coffea canephora Pierre, widely known as Arabica and Robusta. C. arabica L., considering the different varieties and cultivated forms, originates about 65% –70% of the world coffee production. Its origin remounts t o the mountains of Ethiopia (Yemen, AD 850) and it is an a utogamic plant (self -fertile) (Alves, Rodrigues, Antónia Nunes, Vinha, & Oliveira, 2017) . Its cultivation is carried out in regions of moderate temperature from tropical and subtropical areas. Table 4. Chem ical composition of lipid fraction in green coffee Arabica beans Compounds C arabica (%) Triacylglycerols 75.2 Esters with furokaurane skeleton (cafestol and kahweol ) 18.5 Free diterpen es 0.4 Steroid esters and fatty acids 3.2 Sterols 2.2 Tocopherol 0.04 – 0.06 Phosphatides 0.1 – 0.5 Others 1.0 Source: Speer; Kölling -Speer, 2006 .", "Lipids are among the most important components of coffee beans. The lipid content consists of wax, triglycerides and unsaponifiable matter (Tango, 1971). According to Clifford (1985), the oil content in C. arabica is about 16.0%, while C. canephora contains about 10%. Table 4 shows the composition of lipid fraction (oil) in green coffee arabica beans. The main components of green coffee oil (GCO) are triacy lglycerols (75.2%), which are located in the endosperm . The lipid fraction is composed mainly of the fo llowing fatty acids: linoleic ( ~43%), palmitic ( ~31%), oleic (~9-10%), stearic (9 %), arachidic (3%), linolenic (1 -2%), and behenic ( ~1%), and", "diterpenes (esterified cafestol and kahweol within the kaurane family that account for up to 19% of the total oil (de Oliveira et al., 2014) .", "The constituents of lipid fraction of green coffee bean have valua ble properties for formulating cosmetic products like antioxidants and UVB protection. Fatty acids composition with linoleic acid (45.2%) as major constituents is related with the positive effects on cracked skin, eczema, psoriasis and dermatitis (de Azevedo et al., 2008) . According to Velazquez -Pereda et al., (2009) , GCO improved physiological balance in human skin cells, allowing the formation of new connective tissue and preventin g epidermis dryness.", "The content of unsaponifiable matter varies and may reach levels of up to 19% , something uncommon as the content of unsaponifiable matter of most vegetable oils ranges from 1.0% to 1.5% (Wagemaker et al., 2011) . Besides the esterified diterpenes cafestol and kahweol esters , sterols, tocopherol s, phosphatides and waxes (tryptamine derivatives) (Speer & Kölling -Speer, 2006) are observed (Table 4). Unsaponifiable matter would be responsible for moisture binding, skin penetration and adhesion properties (Wagemaker et al., 2011) and also for certain unusual properties of this oil such as low melting point that is not in agreement with its fatty acid composition and high refining loss. Moreover, thediterpenes cafestol and kahweol have been widely studied due to their potential anti-inflamattory (Jung & Jeong, 2004a) and anticarcinogenic effects (Hub er et al., 2008) .", "GCO has been investigated in order to enhance the oxidative stability and/or antioxidant potential by spray drying microencapsulation for cosmetic applications, using biopolymers such as modified starches or gum arabic with maltodextri n, only gum arabic, and chitosan (Carvalho, Silva, & Hu binger, 2014; Frascareli, Silva, Tonon, & Hubinger, 2012; Nosari, Lima, Serra, & Fr eitas, 2015; Silva, Vieira, & Hubinger, 2014) . All these works were conducted by Brazilian research teams. Silva, Vieira, & Hubinger (2014) indicated that the diterpenes (cafestol and kahweol) were not influenced by oxidation reactions. Nosa ri et al., (2015) showed high antioxidant activity of GCO superior to -tocopherol in a photoxidation assay proposed, which combines heat, light and oxygen. However, none o f them showed the compounds directly responsible for the antioxidant activity of GCO.", "4.7 Cold screw pressing", "Cold pressing oils refer to oils that are extracted from plant seeds by mechanical pressing with screw press or hydraulic press without external temperature. Pressure is used to extract oil from the plant seed instead of the conventional solvent extraction method . Its great advantage is that it does not require the use of organic solvent or heat (Association of Official Analytical Ch emists, 2007) . This method ensures extraction of a non -contaminated, protein -rich low fat cake at relatively low -cost. The disadvantage of this method is that the yield is not as high as the solvent extraction, about 8 -14% of the available oil remain in the seed which turned into press cake (Ionescu et al., 201 4). Although oilseed thermal treatment such as cooking allows an increase in oil yield, but it could be responsible for oil degradation . So cold -pressing is usually preferred to retain more health beneficial components such as antioxidants increasing oil nutritive value (Maier, Schieber, Kammerer, & Carle, 2009) . Other s uitable pre -treatments of seeds can also enhance oil yield such as flaking, enzymatic treatment and moisture conditioning . The latter has a key role in expression as an optimal moisture content regarding oil yield can be found depending on seed variety (e.g. linseeds 9 –11% (db), rapeseed 5% (db), crambe seed 3 –4% (db) (Lazouk et al., 2015) . It is important to mention that, in the plant kingdom there are more than 100 oleaginous plants, but only 40 of them can be used f or oil expr ession. The other plants are unprofitable, as they have low oil content in their seeds or as they require a difficult expression process (Ionescu et al., 2014) .", "Figure 9. (A) Cold pressing of green coffee beans. (B) Screw press apparatus (Adapted from: Ionescu et al., 2014).", "The mec hanical screw press consists of a vertical feeder and a horizontal screw with increasing body diameter to exert pressure on the oilseeds as it advances along the length of the press ( Figure 9 ). The barrel surrounding the screw has slots along its length, a llowing the increasing internal pressure to first expel air and then drain the oil through the barrel. Oil is collected in a trough under the screw and the de -oiled cake is commonly discharged at the end of the screw. By mechanical screw pres s a large quan tities of oilseeds can be processed with minimal labor, and it allows continuous oil extraction (Çakaloğlu, Özyurt, & Ötleş, 2018) .", "Raw GCO has a relatively hig h price in the market and is currently obtained by mechanical cold pressing. Due to its large number of current and potential applications in the food, cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries GCO is valued at a higher price compared to coffee itself (Williamson & Hatzakis, 2019) . In addition, high amount of groun d green coffee beans are necessary to produced high-quality oil because of low yield of pressing (2.5 -6%) (Lombo et al., 20 19). Consequently, abundant residual biomass comes from GCO pressing, which is neglected by the in dustry (Castro e t al., 2018; Oliveira et al., 2019; Lombo et al., 2019 ). Nowaday s, there are not enough innovative mechanisms to foster a sustainable reuse of agro -industry by-products from GCO pressing .", "Three works were found in th e scientific literature when cake re sidue from GCO pressing was material of resear ch. Castro et al., (2018) found that extracts of the green seeds and the residue after GCO pressing, especially those prepared with ethanol, have similar chemical profiles, containing phenolic compounds chlorogenic acids and caffeine .The residue extracts showed antioxidant potenti al in DPPH, ABTS, and pyranine a ssays and low cytotoxicity. Mayanga -Torres et al., (2017) evaluated the performance of flow -through subcritical water for recovering valuable phenolic compounds from defatted cake. The maximum yield of TPC from defatted cake was 55.7 mg GAE/g (175 ◦C, 22.5 MPa). More recently, Oliveira , Santos, & Queiroz, (2019) extracted the gre en coffee seeds and cake of pressing with 6 different organic solvents in a Soxhlet type apparatus for 3 and 5 h, obtaining the best results for cake and seeds at 3h with ethanol (67.99 and 40.48 and mg GAE/g, respectively).", "Finally, quality standards for exported coffee that must be met to be labelled as “S” coffee on the ICO Certificate of Origin are: (a) for Arabica, not to have more than", "86 defects per 300 g sample (New York green coffee classification/Brazilian method, or equivalent) and (b) for both Arabica and Robusta, not to have a moisture content below 8% or in excess of 12.5%, measured using the ISO 6673 method (McCormick, 2002) . This leads to remove high amount of defective beans to reach those quality standards towards exportation (Turatti, 2001) .Thus, defective beans can be pressed to obtain high - quality GCO for alternative applications and uses, for example, as ingredient for active biodegradable films for packaging.", "4.8 References", "Akhtar, H.

Introduction", "Green coffee beans is a very important commodity for many developing countries. Brazil (32%), Vietnam (20%), and Colombia (10%) are the world’s three largest producers (ICO, 2019). Coffee consumption is a regular part of daily life throughout the world and stric tly as sociated with the social habits and the culture o f individual countries (Homan & Mobarhan, 2006) . Recently, other valuable products have been explored from green coffee beans (GCB) . One is green coffee oil (GCO) , which has attracted the cosmetic industry due to its emo llient properties, absorption capacity of solar UVB radiation and antioxidant propert ies (de Oliveira et al., 2014) . Lipid fraction in GCB ranges from 7 to 17 % (dry basi s) dep ending on the coffee origin. Arabica GCO contains about 75% of fatty acids , mainly linoleic (43.1%, C18:2) and palmitic (31.1%, C16:0) acids and an exceptional unsaponifiable matter up to 19%, while most vegetable oils rang es from 1.0% to 1.5% (Speer et al., 2006) . On an industrial scale, GCO is extracted by mechanical cold pressing, which does not involve heat and organic solvents. Thus, the obtained high -quality GCO is safe for human applications. The pressing performance of oilseeds depends o n the method of preparing the raw material, which consist of a number of unit operations such as cleaning, cracking, cooking, grinding, drying or moistening to optimal moisture content (Martínez et al., 2008). However, in all scenarios, mechanical pressing of GC B has low oil recovering and concomitant high amount of residual biomass, which usually is underutilized by coffee industry and most of the phenolic compounds remain there. Phenolic compounds in green coffee beans are present predominantly as a fami ly of esters formed between certain hydroxycinnamic acids and quinic acid collectively known as chlorogenic acids (CGA). Green coffee beans is known as one of the main food sources of CGA, with contents being equaled or exceeded only by the green leaves of Illex paraguayensis (Maté) (Farah and Donangelo 2006). These compounds have a number of beneficial health properties related to their potent antioxidant activity as well as hepatoprotective, hypoglycemic and antiviral activities (Gawlik -Dziki et al. 2014; Guy e t al. 2009). Therefore, the press -cake from cold -pressed GCO has gained interest, especially with the confirmation of its high antioxidant activity (Castro et al. 2018; Resende Oliveira et al. 2019). However, there are no scientific reports on GCO pr essing conditions from either regular or defective unroasted beans, as well as about the residue", "formed by the precipitation of finer materials from the raw oil called sediment. Moreover, there are not enough innovative mechanisms to foster a sustainable r euse o f agro-industry by -products from GCO pressing.", "One strategy of developing biodegradable films is based on the concept that natural blends of hydrocolloids and lipids take advantage of each component in the original system (Dias et al. , 2010) . The f ood packaging industry is interest ed in biodegradable and bioactive materials to satisfy both food challenges, and meeting consumers concern for non -natural additives and avoiding the ecological impacts of synthetic materials. Carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC ) is one of the most prominent natural polymers because of its good thermal stability (Kivelä et al. , 2011) and excellent ability to form transparent films with a very efficient barrier against oxygen, carbon dioxide a nd lip ids (Ghanbarzadeh et al , 2011). In previous work, GCO were added for first time in biodegradable films and its mechanical impacts considered only a single concentration (Lombo et al., 2020) .", "The incorporation of lipids in hydrocolloid -based films reduce the sensitivity of hydrocolloids to moisture , whereas they can modify mechanical properties of films (Jiménez et al., 2018) . Thus , packaging materials added wi th lipids need to confirm adequate mechanical strength . The use of plasticizer s and emulsifier s have a key role in ensuring good film elaboration, and also affects the mechanical properties of films, mainly strengthen (Meritaine da Rocha et al., 2018) . The aim of this work was to study the cold -pressed oil conditions of commercial green coffee beans , focusi ng on total phenolic content of both green coffee oil and the by -products (cake and sediment) and to compare with defective beans. Green coffee oil was also analysed by mass spectrometry and the effect of several concentrations on mecha nical properties of carboxymethyl cellulose films was stud ied from a sustainabl e and economical perspective.", "2.

Oil yields ranged from 2.8 to 5.9%, which is considered low compared to solvent extraction in the Soxhlet apparatus (8 -10%) (Tsukui et al., 2014). Indeed, the oil content in GCB (7.7 to 17.7% d.b.) is also low considering the most common oleaginous seed oil content is above 40% (Lazouk et al., 2015) . Both low oil content and yield of pressing in GCB certainly impact the GCO market prices . Oil yield increased in tiger nut (Cyperus esculentus) samples with the smallest particle size u sed (≤ 500μm) (Ezeh et al., 2016) . Similarly, the highest GCO yield here (5.9%) was obtained with the finest particle s ize used (<850 μm). This sample (GCB -F) also showed the highest moisture content (11.2% ), and both yield and moisture were significant (p < 0.05).", "Seed moisture is a crucial parameter in cold pressing as it increases plasticity, promoting lubrication. In soybean and sunflower seeds, a decrease in the force needed to initiate seed structure rupture was observed with an increase in water content (Lazouk et al., 2015). High moisture content may also decrease oil yield due to the lack of friction during pressi ng. Moisture content should be determined for seeds of each plant species in order to i ncrease oil yield (Ezeh et al., 2016). Globally, moisture of GCB was", "in a range from 9.3 to 11.2% ( Table 1 ). It therefore seems that moisture content around 11% improved GCO yield.", "Table 1. Yield, moisture and TPC of GCO, cake and sediment by -products .

No significant difference (p > 0.05) was found in TPC of oils between samples with fine and medium particle size, including defective beans which had medium particle size (GCB -D). In general, TPC in GCO samples ranged from 0.57 to 0.82 (mg GAE/g) with the highest value for greatest particle size (p<0.05). These values were slightly higher than those obtained in extra -virgin olive oil (0.55 mg GAE/g) and much higher than rapeseed oil(0.18 mg GAE/g), the o nly two oils included in the 100 richest dietary sources of polyphenols identified by using Phenol -Explorer database (Pérez - Jiménez et al., 2010) . Rombaut et al., (2015) reported great variability of polyphenol content among 16 grape seed oil samples (from 0.05 to 0.15 mg GAE/g). Interestingly, grape see d oil is another rare cas e of seeds with low oil content extractable (8 to 20% d.b.), therefore it is good for comparative purposes with GCO.", "The press -cake represents ~90% of residual biomass from GCO extraction by cold-pressing (Lombo et al., 2020). As t he demand for GCO has increased in the cosmetic industry, the residual press -cake became of interest because of its antioxidant potential. Higher amounts of phenolic compounds were extracted from cake by using ethanol 70% for 3 h, then using ethanol 99% fo r 60 min (67.9 and 34. 9 mg GAE/g, respectively) (Oliveira et al., 2019; Resende Oliveira et al., 2019) .

The TPC found in sediment was lower than in cake, ranging from 29.3 to 41.1 (mg GAE/g). So far, only a few studies have included this by -product from raw cold -pressed oils. One of them Rombaut e t al., (2015) fo und values ranged from 10 to 40 (mg GAE/g) in the sediment of cold -pressed grape seed oil.

The TPC in the intact beans (non-pressed) of regular beans (40.3 mg GAE/g) was very similar with the TPC found in press -cakes samples. This finding confirms that mostly of phenolic compounds remained in the residual biomass (Fig. 2.).

Additionally, it cou ld also be affected by pressing conditions, or coffee species and origin. Therefore, under the pressing and sampling conditions used here, we observed that by using defective beans, oil yield was indeed higher (p< 0.05) than for regular beans with the same particle size, while the TPC of oils was not significant (p> 0.0 5).", "The defects in coffee that may considerably affect cup quality are immature beans, immature -black beans with oxidized skin, black beans (over -ripened fruits) and sour beans (fruits fermen ted). Higher phenolic compounds and chlorogenic acid levels were found in immature and immature -black defective beans compared with healthy beans (Farah & Donangelo, 2006; Franca et a l., 2005) . These findings can explain why both cake and sediment from defective beans showed higher TPC compared with regular beans. It is expected that large amounts of defective beans will be generated in future years from coffee production based upon t he consumer’s tendency to purchase higher quality gourmet coffee, as these higher grade coffee beans have fuller flavours and enhanced aromaticity.

Therefore, the constituents in GCO from the sample with highest oil yield (GCB -F) were identified by their accurate m/z values and main MS/MS fragments in the negative ion mode (Table 2). All identified compounds have already been described i n literature for coffee samples. Related to the major constituents in GCO, which were fatty acids, it was observed the main fatty acid: linoleic acid ( m/z 279.2329, [M -H]-), followed by palmitic aci d (m/z 255.2329, [M -H]-), they represent ~42% and ~36%, re spectively (Oliveira et al., 2006) . Oleic ( m/z 281.2480, [M -H]-) and stearic ( m/z 283.2642, [M -H]) acids are present in significant amounts (~11 and ~9%, respectively). A rachidic ( m/z 311.2955, [M -H]-) and behenic (m/z 339.3268, [M -H]-) acids are commonly found in small quantit ies (~3 and ~1%) (Speer et al. , 2006) .

P -coumaroylquinic acid (m/z 337.0928 , [M-H]-), is present in low quantit y.

Lang et al., (2013) expressed concern about the possible risks due to the commercialization of supplements formulated from crude coffee bean extracts. These compounds were useful to discriminate the post -harvest processes for coffees from two consecutive crops (Tsukui e t al., 2019) .", "3.3 Effect of GCO on mechani cal properties of films", "According to Oliveira, et al. , (2006) there were no si gnificant differences in the amounts of all fatty acids f or crude and roasted healthy and defective beans . Thus, we used GCO from the regular beans with highest oil yield (GCB -F) to elaborate the films. As Cerqueira et al., (2012) pointed out, the addition of lipids to hydrocolloids films decre ases the tensile strength (TS) , while elongation a t break (EB) depends on the lip id properties such as molecular weight, physical state and hydrophilic moieties, etc., and also the presence of plasticizers .", "Mechanical property of the developed films is showed in Table 3 . GCO decreased the TS of CMC films in presence of plasticizer gly cerol. Glycerol is commonly used to facilitate processing and/or to increase films flexibility, but it causes large drop in TS due to the partial replacement of stronger polymer -polymer interactions by weaker polymer -oil and polymer -glycerol interaction in the network (Noshirvani et al., 2017) . As consequence, CMC film matrix lost strengt h influenced by concentration of both glycerol and GCO (p< 0.05) .", "Table 3.

In another study, the addition of virgin coconut oil at 0.28 g/2 g starch in presence of glycerol (0.9 g), improved TS but when concen tration increased from 0.56 to 2.24 g/2 g starch, the TS decreased while EB was not strongly affected (Fangfang et al. 2020) . However, mechanical property of films was improve d after the addition of lecithin at 0.5 and 0.1 g in presenc e of glycerol (0.5 mL) and GCO (0.3 mL), which enhanced the strength of films significantly (p<0.05) in comparison to emulsifier -free film. Furthermore, lecithin helps to prevent the tendency of f ilm to loss strength and gain excess of flexibility (EB) by increasing amounts of GCO and glycerol. Martelli et al., (2017 ) explain that probable positively charged phosphatidylcholine groups of lecithin interact with CMC anion ic groups, leading to the formation of stronger chemical bonds and thus resulting in more resistant films (high TS) . Also, lecithin promote d homogeneo us distribution of film components which would avoid phase separation phenomena (Martelli e t al., 2017) . In Fig. 4. we proposed a simple schematic", "representation of the CMC matrix interactions.

A simple schematic representation of CMC -based on films added with GCO, glycerol and hydrogenated lecithin.", "Consequently, in this study , the best mechanical properties were observed with 0.3 mL of GCO in the presence of lecithin (0.1 g) and glycerol (0.5 mL). This film formulation had the ability to hold both the greatest strength (38.6 MPa) and greatest flexibility (27.6%) (Fig. 5 ). This aforementi oned result seems to be a suitable approach to develop composite biobased materials for food packaging with satisfact ory mechanical features and impart other possible properties to the matrix based on GCO’s rich composition of fatty acids, the presence of phenolic acids, as well as other bioactive compounds from the unsaponifi able fraction.

Conclusions", "The results achieved in this work fill a gap in the scientific literature about cold pressing of GCO. Oil yield was increased with the highest moisture content and the smallest particle size. However, TPC in GCO was significantly higher only with the greatest particl e size (p<0.05). GCO by -products, cake and sediment from defective beans showed higher conten t of phenolic compounds compared with regular beans. The mass spectrometry analysis confirmed all those fatty acids reported for GCO, phenolic acids and ca rboxyatr actyloside II. The rate GCO (0.3 mL), lecithin (0.1 g) and glycerol (0.5 mL) in CMC matrix pr oduced films with promising applications for food products because of good mechanical properties.

Introduction", "The first synthetic plastic — Bakelite — was produced in 1907. In 1950 the world produced only 2 million tonnes per year. To 2 015, the production reached 381 million tonnes. Plastic pollution is having a negative impact on the oceans and wildlife health (Ritchier & Roser, 2020). However, the industries that generate the most of plastic waste, such as food packaging, have been als o the most interested in the development of more ecofriendly products, such as biodegradable films (Meritaine da Rocha et al., 2018). Films based on hydrocolloids are promising altern atives to oil - based plastic films. They may display better oxygen barrier than synthetic polymer due to lot of bonds between chains which form a tortuous pathway for gasses trough film matrix (Sahraee et al., 2019). Moreover, they can be combined with natu ral lipids (emulsion -based films) to reduce their self -sensitive to moist ure which is one of their main drawbacks (Tongnuanchan et al., 2015).", "Among hydrocolloids, cellulose is an insoluble material that is also the most abundant biomass resource on earth , offering great opportunities in films as packaging. Carboxymethyl cellu lose (CMC) obtained by reacting sodium monochloroacetate with cellulose in alkaline medium is one of the most prominent products, due to its economic importance as a thickening and em ulsifying agent, widely used in pharmaceuticals, in cosmetics, and in foo d (Barbucci et al., 2000). CMC is a highly water -soluble anionic polysaccharide that generally forms transparent films with good mechanical and barrier properties against oxygen and l ipids (Ballesteros et al., 2018; Ghanbarzadeh and The inc orporation of bioactive compounds in biodegradable films play a crucial role in the active packaging technology resulting in innovative solutions for extending the shelf -life, maintai n or monitor the quality of lipid foods (Ganiari et al., 2017). Thus, chemical, enzymatic or physical processes can be investigated and optimized in such a way to recover functional molecules with antioxidant and antimicrobial properties, such as polypheno ls from red and white wine pomaces (Gontard et al., 2018). These molecule s can be exploited as green additives in polymeric systems to impart specific properties to the matrix (Kirschweng et al., 2017). In recent works, the addition of agro - waste extracts into bio -based films significantly improved the antioxidant activity.", "Furthermore, it was observed protective effects again lipid oxidation in lipid -rich food models (de Moraes Crizel et al., 2018; Serrano -León et al., 2018; Wu et al., 2018). The cold pr essing of unroasted green coffee beans (Coffea Arabica L.) generates abun dant residues to obtain green coffee oil (GCO), an attractive ingredient for cosmetic formulations with UVB absorption, anti -aging and emollient properties (Nosari et al., 2015; Wagem aker et al., 2015). The residues are represented by the press cake (~90%) and the sediments after raw GCO clarified, both of them remained rich in chlorogenic acids (CGA) and oil(Castro et al., 2018; Lombo Vidal et al., 2020; Oliveira et al., 2019). CGA ar e responsible for the strong antioxidant properties of green coffee extra cts again lipid oxidation (Budryn et al., 2014; Dziki et al., 2015; Gawlik -Dziki et al., 2014; Madhava Naidu et al., 2008). CGA are able to directly interact with reactive oxygen spec ies, it is mainly attributed to the double bond conjugated catechol struc ture of the phenyl rings (Nallamuthu et al., 2014).", "CGA -rich extracts from GCO residues has recently been incorporated in bio - based films (Lombo Vidal et al., 2020), however the tech no-functional and antioxidant properties observed in these films required applications to confirm its efficiency as active food packaging material. Fish oil is an interesting food model because it is very prone to oxidation with a rate that is significantl y faster than other oils due to its high content of n -3 polyunsaturated f atty acids (PUFAs) characteristics. PUFAs (n -3) are important in human diet because they prevent cardiovascular diseases and carcinogenesis processes (Agnihotri, Sharma, Rani, Renuka, & Bhatnagar, 2016; Lee et al., 2018; Marchioli et al., 2002), and mamma ls do not synthesize them. The oxidation of fish oil is further increased under improper processing and/or storage conditions (e.g., temperature abuse, exposure to light and humidity) (Wang et al., 2017; Yeşilsu & Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate and compare the effect of two residue extracts (CE and SE) from cold -pressed GCO on the antioxidant activity, migration, O2 barrier properties, UV -Vis absorptio n capacity and physicochemical properties of resulting active CMC -based f ilms. Antioxidant compounds were identified and quantified by HPLC in raw materials: cake, sediment and oil.

The film incorporated with sediment extract at 40% showed the lowest light transmission, corresponding to 90% of reduction in comparison to contr ol films. Bitencourt et al., (2014) found values between 0.01 and 0.35% of transmittance (200 -500 nm) with gelatine -based films incorporated with ethanolic extract of cur cuma and attributed this good barrier to UV -Vis radiation to phenolic compounds.", "Gree n coffee beans contain a great amount of polyphenols compounds, especially chlorogenic acid (Perrone et al., 2008) . These compounds are present in SE and CE and could be responsible for the very high barrier to UV radiation. In addition, Wagemaker, Carvalho, Maia, Baggio, & Guerreiro Filho, (2011) reported the efficacy of GCO to absorb UV radiation due to the high content of linoleic acid in the lipid fraction, but also to the properties of wax, tocopherols and unsaponifiable matter in this fraction. GCO also produced a reduction o f light t ransmission, proportional to the concentration (0.2%) used in films. Consequently, in this study the contribution to the UV absorption, mainly in the films with the highest concentration of SE, can be attributed to a synergistic effect of the phen olic comp ounds and the components on the lipid fraction.", "Similarly, the transparency values ( Table 5 ) were significantly different in all film formulations (p< 0.05).

GCO at 0.2% was not enough to re duce WVP compared with pure CMC (p>0.05). The tendency to decrease WVP values in CMC films after extracts incorporation was not significant (p>0.05). However, this suggests a good hydrophilic/hydrophobic balance, and distribution of phenoli c compounds and fatty acids in the film network facilitated by lecithin addition, and perhaps this made films more s table during drying process (Martelli et al., 2017) . It is also probable that compounds with polar groups, mainly phenolics from SE and CE, can form hydrogen bonds reducing the amount of free ( –OH) groups in the CMC structure (Siripatrawan & Harte, 2010) . In addition, the permeability of emulsion films is also influenced by the existence of “tortuosity” for diffusion of water mol ecules and steric hindrance (Nur & Nur , 2017) .

In contrast with the results reported in this study, other natural compounds have been incorporated into CMC matrices, modifying mechanical propertie s such as: alpha -tocopherol (Martelli et al., 2017) , essential oi ls from ginger and cinnamon (Noshirvani et al., 2017) , and Zataria multiflora (Dashipour et al., 2015) .

However, GCO can partially replace the stronge r interactions polymer -polymer in C -O film (CMC and", "108 GCO), but its effect was only significant on tensile strength (p<0.05). A similar study showed that the best effect of oleic acid on mechanical properti es of CMC films was at 0.6% (Ghanbarzadeh & Almasi, 2011) .", "3.6 Total phenolic content and antioxidant activity of extracts and CMC films Table 8 shows the results of the antioxidant acti vity of the films and GCO and the hydroalcoholic extracts from their residues. The phenolic content and DPPH free radical scavenging capacity were used to assess the antioxidant capacity of both extracts and films. The phenolic content in the residue extra cts was higher in CE that in SE (105.97 and 85.36 mg GAE/g of dry material), respectively. These findings agree with those previously reported for GCO resi due extracts. Castro et al. , (2018) studied the antioxidant potential of GCO cake by using four hydro alcoholic solvents obtaining values between 11.5 -14.7% of total phenolic compounds GAE in dry extracts. We obtained 10.6% of total phenolic compounds in cake residue. Moreover, scientific information on the bioacti vity of GCO sediment was not found.", "The p henolic content determined in CMC films with and without residue extracts was usually proportional to the concentration of extract added and was statistically significant (p<0.05). In edible films based on pomelo p eel flour incorporated with tea polyphenol s (concentrated product), the total phenolic content increased from 8.12 mg GAE/g for the control film to 38.26 mg GAE/g for the f ilm with 20% of polyphenols (Wu et al., 2018) . In this wo rk, an increase from 0.15 mg GAE/g in the control film to 51.28 mg GAE/g in the film with 40% of CE was observed.", "The radical scavenging capacity of GCO, residue extracts and films showed a similar trend to phenolic content, except for the films free of re sidue extracts ( Table 8 ). The antioxidant activity shown by GCO was not detected in the film added only with GCO. This result was not rare because of the low proportion of GCO (0.2%), its phenolic content ( 20 fold less than cake), and differences in the p henolic extraction method for raw materials and films. In addition, C -O film was not added with lecithin, which promotes homogeneous distribution of film components and release o f antioxidant compounds (Martelli et al., 2017; Tongnuanchan et al., 2015) .

Thus, the measure of DPPH scavenging activity in the extracts can support the film performance. We found the highest DPPH activity in C - CE40% film (643.83 µmol Trolox/g of dried film).

Conclusions", "CMC -based films attesting the highest level of antioxidant capacity were obtained by incorporating GCO and hydroalcoholic extract of cake at 40%, emulsified with lecithin. The addition of both extracts, cake and sediments, caused a significant increase of flexibility and decrease of tensile strength, probably due to intermolecular interaction among CMC chains, phenolic compounds, and GCO. The film s urface was rough and heterogeneous in the films incorporated with residue extracts, partly due to the presence of fibres, without any significant deterioration of barrier properties. However, the WVP values in these films slightly decreased compared with t hose of control films, but they were not significant and the GCO concentration (0.2%) was low to improve this property by itself. Color parameters, transmittance, and transparency were affected by the type of extracts and concentration with remarkable UV - absorption. Cons equently, the films developed in this work, mainly those containing CE, seem to be a promising alternative as natural additives and for applications on active food packaging.", "5.

The ef fect of these extracts along GCO was investigated on physicochemical, barrier, antioxidant properties and t he ability of the active films to delay fish oil oxidation . The films added to CE and SE s howed high antioxidant activity (3.61±0.01 and 2.03±0.01 mm ol Trolox eq/g dry film, respectively). These findings a re in line with the CGA content in CE and SE (9.8 and 9.0% w/w, respectively) determined by HPLC. The addition of CE and SE did not greatly affect the oxygen barrier of CMC films, while providing them with remarkable Ultraviolet -Visible (UV-Vis) absorption. Fish oil samples covered with active films exhibited lower values for peroxide and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances than those placed in direct contact with the bulk oil and controls (p<0.05 ) during storage at 40 ℃ for 16 days . The antioxidant release from CE and SE added films showed antagonistic behaviour into the food simulants . Although both active films are promising for active packaging, the film added with SE showed to be more advantageous for oil-rich food protection.", "Keywords: Bio-based films; carboxymethyl cellulose; chlorogenic acids, cod liver oil; cold-pressed oil; release of antioxidants.", "120 1. Introduction", "The first synthetic plastic — Bakelite — was produced in 1907. In 1950 the world p roduced only 2 million tonnes of plastic per year. By 2015, production had reached 381 million tonnes . Plastic pol lution is having a dramatically negative impact on oceans and wildlife health (Ritchier & Roser, 2020). However, t he industries that generate most plastic waste, such as food packaging, are very interested in the development of more ecofriendly produc ts, such as biodegradable films (Meritaine da Rocha et al., 2018) . Films based on hydrocolloids are promising alternatives to petrol - derived plastic films. They may display better oxygen barrier than synthetic polymer owing to a great deal of bonds between chains which form a tortuous pathway for gases throug hout the film matrix (Sahraee et al., 2019) . Moreover, they can be combined with natural lipids (emulsion -based films) to improve their water bar rier resistance which is otherwise quite low and one of their m ain drawbacks (Bourlieu et al., 2009; Tongnuanc han et al., 2015) .", "Among hydrocolloids, c ellulose is an insoluble material that is also the most abundant biomass resource on Earth, offering great opportunities as food -packaging material s. C arboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) obtained by reacting sodium monochloroacetate with cellulose in alkaline medium is one of the most prominent products, owing to its economic importance as a thickening and emulsifying agent , with wide use in pharmaceuticals , in cosmetics, and in food (Yaradoddi et al., 2020) . CMC is a highly water -soluble anionic polysaccharide that generally forms transparent films. These films, when used on low a w range, where CMC wat er sensitivity is not a drawback, display good mechanical and barrier properties against oxygen and lipids (Arik Kibar and Us, 2013; Ballesteros et al., 2018) .", "The incorporation of bioactive compounds in biodegradable films plays a crucial role in active packaging technology, resulting in innovative solutions for extending the shelf -life, maintaining or monitoring the quality of foods (Ganiari et al., 2017) . Thus, chemical, enzymatic or physical processes can be investigated and optimized in such a way to recover functional molecules with antioxidant and a ntimicrobial properties, e.g., polyphenols from red and white wine pomaces (Gontard et al., 2018) . These molecules can be exploited as green additives in polymeric systems to impart specific properties to the matrix (Kirschweng et al., 2017) . In rec ent works, the addition of agricultural waste", "121 extracts into bio -based films has significantly improved the ir antioxidant activity. Furthermore, protective effects have been found again st lipid oxidation in lipid-rich food models (de Moraes Crizel et al., 2018; Serrano -León et al., 2018; Wu et al., 2018) . Cold pressing of unroasted green coffee beans ( Coffea Arabica L.) generates abundant residues to obtain green coffee oil (GCO), an attractive ingredi ent for cosmetic fo rmulations with UVB absorption, anti -aging and emollient properties (Nos ari et al., 2015; Oliveira et al., 2018) . Two main residues are obtained after GCO processing: a solid residue called the press cake (~ 90 %, w/w total residues) and the sediment after clarified raw GCO, both of them remained rich in chlorogenic acids (CGA) and oil (Castro et al., 2018; Lombo Vidal et al., 2020; Oliv eira et al., 2019) . CGA are responsible for the strong antioxidant properties of green coffee extracts against lipid oxidation (Budryn et al., 2014; Dziki et al., 2015; Gawlik -Dziki e t al., 2014) . CGA are able to directly interact with reactive oxygen species , which is mainly due to the double bond conjugated catechol structure of phenyl ring s (Nallamuthu et al., CGA -rich extracts from GCO residues have been recently incorporated into bio - based films (Lombo Vidal et al., 2020) ; however, the techno -functional and putative antioxidant p roperties observed in these films required test applications to confirm their efficiency as active food packaging material. Fish oil is an interesting food model because it is very prone to oxidation with a rate significantly faster than that of other oils owing to its high content in n -3 long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA s). n-3 PUFA s are important in human diet because they prevent cardiovascular diseases and carcinogenesis processes (Agnihotri et al., 2016; Lee et al., 201 8), and mammals are not able to synthesiz e the main n -3 precursor C18:3, alpha -linolenic -acid which must be brought by the diet. Since fish oil are very prone to oxidative, improper processing and/or storage conditi ons (e.g., temperature abuse, exposure to light and humidity) will result in shor t time deterioration (Wang et al., 2017; Yeşilsu & Özyurt, 2019 ). The aim of this study was to evaluate and compare the effect of two residue extracts (Cake Extract - CE and Sediment E xtract - SE) from cold -pressed GCO on the antioxidant activity, antioxidant release, O 2 barrier properties, Ultraviolet -Visible (UV- Vis) absorption capacity and physicochemical properties of resulting active CMC -based films.

Based on the PV obtained for GCO (2.5 meq O 2/kg), there was no extensive oxidative degradation during the processing of green coffee beans and/or oil extract ion. However, the high free fatty acid value found (6.0%, as oleic acid) could be related to the moisture content and endogenous lipase activity of green coffee beans. In this study, an appropriate balance was achieved between moisture content (11.4%) and oil yield (4.2%) of green coffee beans. Indeed, low moisture content increases the force needed to initiate seed structure rupture, while high moisture content may also decrease oil yield owing to the lack of friction during pressing (Lazouk et al., 2015) .", "Cold pressing of GCO produced abundant residual biomass corresponding to cake (91%), as well as residual oil in sediment (58.1%), which raises interest in th e valorization of these residues.

Perrone et al., (2008) found that these three isomers (3 -, 4- and 5 -CQA), account for about 83% of total CGA in green coffee beans of C. arabica cultivars from Brazil . CGA were not detected in GCO, probably due to the low affinity of phenolic compounds for oil. Caffeine was detected in GCO (0.2%), but wa s more concentrated in CE (3.7%) and even more in SE (4.5%).

Nevertheless, t he total solids of film forming solution s were used to calculate the appropriate mass to obtain homogenous thickness.

It can be explained by their large number of hydrogen bonds, which helps adjacent chains binding tightly to each other, resulting in a dense polymer matrix (Sahraee et al., 2019). The O 2P values at 50 % RH of CMC -based active films developed in this study ( Table 3 ) ranged from 8 to 10 x10- 17mol.m .m2. s-1.Pa-1 (C-CE and C -SE, respectively).", "The slight tendency to increase O2P of active films was not significantly except for film C -SE in comparison with control (6× 10-17mol.m.m-2.s-1.Pa-1). This tendency could be due to the incorporation of liquid l ipids into hydrocolloid films; this usually implies an increase in the oxygen permeability due to the enhancement of the oxygen solubility in the film, which promotes the transfer of the oxygen molecules (Fabra et al., 2012) . Conversely, when antioxidant compounds or oils with antioxidant properties ar e present in the film matrix, O2P could be lower by direct chemical trapping of oxygen by antioxidants. In this sense, CGA present in CE and SE could be able to block the diffusion of oxygen molecules mediated by lipid components in the active film matrix. However, this effect of CGA is not sufficient to improve O 2P barrier property under typical experimental conditions, i.e. when a strong oxygen flow rate is sweeping the film.", "It is worth mentioning that the resulting active films are good oxygen barrier at 50% relative humidity.

It is worth mentioning that the resulting active films are good oxygen barrier at 50% relative humidity. In higher relative humidity O 2P values can increase because of hydrophilic nature of both CMC and CGA l eading more polymer chain mobility.", "3.5 Light t ransmission and film transparency", "UV–Vis spectra and transparency result s in Table 4 showed very low transmittance (and concomitant high absorbance) values , mainly in the UV region (below 0.0%). Our previous w ork revealed very similar values with higher ab sorbance of C-SE film in comparison with C-CE (Lombo Vidal et al., 2020) . In the present work, GCO sediment extract was deffated before addition into films (named hereafter C -SE def) to get rid of residual oil contribution in the light transmission and film transpa rency. Defatting SE decreased 2 -folds the UV -Vis barrier capacity in comparison with the non -defatted C -SE films but had no impact on transparency. Transmittance is related to polymer alignment in the film network (Akhtar et al., 2018) .

Data are reported by average and standard deviation (n=3 ) in d.b . GCO did not show presence of CGA by HPLC analysis ; only caffeine was detected (Table 2) and GCO antioxidan t activity was low (0.34 mmol Trolox eq/g of oil). Chiari et al., (2014) reported similar low antioxidant activity in GCO and Esquivel & Jiménez (2012) associated the an tioxidant activity with the content of tocopherols and linoleic acid. GCO has an uncommon content of unsaponifiable matter am ong natural oils, reaching up to 19% (w/w). Therefore, this fraction was extracted to characterize its antioxidant activity due to the presence of tocopherols, diterpenes (cafestol and kahweol) and phosphatides (Speer and Kölling -Speer, 2006) . It is thus clear that almost half of the antioxidant activity of GCO is linked to the unsaponifiable fraction that represented 13% of GCO matter in this study ( Table 1 ). In the present work, C -CE films had highest DPPH reducing abilities than C -SE (Table 5). This result can be c losely related to the higher concentrations of CGA in CE than in SE. In our previous work, films were obtained by dissolving CMC (2 g) directly in 100 mL of 20 or 40% GCO residue extract s solutions , resulting in GCO residue/CMC ratios of 0.5:2 and 1: 2 (w/w , considering the total solid content) (Lombo et al., 2020) . In this", "136 work, the rat io GCO residue/ polymer was increased by adding 1 g of dried/concentrated (using vacuum and room temperature) GCO residue extract in the CMC ( 2 g) solution , resulting in GCO residue -CMC ratio of 1:2 (w/w, d.b). The DPPH reducing abilities of C-CE films were more than 5 -fold higher than the C -CE-films at the highest concentration ( 40%) (0.644 mmol eq. Trolox/g d.b) reported in our previous work , where the GCO residue extracts were kept in solution until they were used as medium to dissolve the polymer. This way of film elaboration probably affected the CMC solubility, the distribution of active compounds in the film network and thei r stability. Consequently, in this study dried/concentrated GCO residue extracts added in aqueous CMC solution provide better protection of the functionality of antioxidants compounds during film formation and conditioning and it boost ed their antioxidant efficiency . To confirm the efficiency of films as active food packaging material , their antioxidant capacity was explored: 1) either indirectly, through headspace , supposing that the film can be separated from the food by an inert atmosphere that must be protected by the film; 2) or directly, supposing that the active film may be in contact with the food and that such contact will trigger the migration of active compounds released from film matrix onto the food surface. T he mechanism of release depends largely on the film material and its morphology, the partition coefficient between polymer/solvent , as well as , the polarity of the antioxidant compounds in relation to the packaged or covered food (Maryam et al., 2018) .", "Considering firstly the release of antioxidant compounds from both active films C-CE and C -SE in model solutions (Fig. 3), we observed that this release was much higher in wate r (49.9 and 14.2 mg GAE/g o f d.b., for C-CE and C -SE respectively) than in ethanol (2.0 and 5.4 mg GAE/g of d.b ., C-CE and C -SE respectively) . More precisely, in ethanol, the release of antioxidants decreased drastically from C -CE and C - SE active films (95% and 61%, respectively). I n water, the hydrophilic nature of CMC facilitates the relaxation of polymer chains resulting in a high swelling degree in which most part of the active films was dissolved after 7 days. In this way, the inter actions between CGA and hydrophilic groups of t he CMC matrix through the potential hydrogen bonding could be limited by competitive binding effect of water molecules. A similar trend was observed in soy protein isolate and fish gelatine films added with mango kernel extract, i.e. high antioxidant relea se in water (67.8 and 6 9.0 µg GAE /g,", "137 respectively) and considerable decreases in ethanol (12.4 and 16. 9 µg GAE /g, respectively) (Adilah et al., 2018) .", "Figure 3. Release of antioxidant compounds from active films into food simulant solutions after 7 days at 25 ℃.", "It is important to note that no hydrophobic liquid simulant that could be a good model of fish oil investigat ed in the model food was added in this step. However, GCO natural low content in CGA and in other antioxidants give us an indication that GCO residues’antioxidants solubility in an oil is probably l imited. 3.7 Food model system using fish oil indirectly or directly protected by the active film To better approach active film protection in real conditions, we set up a test of the active film material in a model food system and assessed two types of mec hanisms: 1) indirect contact of the film with food but pro tection of an inert headspace; 2) direct contact of the film with the food. In addition, as a putative positive control we decided to integrate direct contact also of the food with GCO -residues. A n egative control with no film on, i.e. with fish oil direct ly exposed to ambient air was used as a reference to be compared with direct modalities (2) and (3), i.e. active films and residue extracts placed in direct contact with fish oil . A positive control with oil covered with an aluminium foil was used as a ref erence for indirect mode (1) . 49.90 C-CE 2:1 C-SE 2:1 C-G-LTPC (mg EGA/g d.b.matter) Film samplesWater Ethanol 95%", "138 3.7.1 Peroxide value (PV)", "Lipid hydroperoxide measurements are typically used to determine primary oxidation products. The oxidation status in oils is commonly measured by the PV. Active films placed onto the perforated lids were efficient to protect fish oil in glass pots at 40 ℃ (Fig. 4A). This configuration was much more efficient than the one where the film was directly immersed into the oil. The C-SE and C -CE films in indirect contact showed decreased PV values between 80 to 90% in comparison with the control sample cov ered with aluminium foil (33.0; 67.2 and 364.2 Meq O 2/kg, respectively) at the end of the storage period. However , although the indirect protection by active CMC - GCO residues films was important in comparison to control, the acceptability limit of 10 Meq O 2/kg oil was already reached in 4 days.", "It is important to note that indirect protection by CMC control film with glycerol and lecithin ( C-G-L) did also lead to fair protection of the oil in comparison with control (110 versus 364.2 Meq O 2/kg, respectively at the end of storage). We can explain this result by the fact that the low O2P of active films and C-G-L control film limit the quantity of O 2 in the headspace above the oil explaining corroborating part of the oil stabilization.", "Then the use of active f ilms as indirect food packaging enables additional stabilization in comparison with CMC control films . The presenc e of antioxidants would play a key role in protecting the fish oil against oxidation by O 2 scavenging mechanism. We can hypothesi ze that a fra ction of the CGA can help trapping O 2 radicals but both C -CE and C -SE seems to contains quite similar amounts of CGA and antioxidant, it is thus difficult to set precise hypothesis that can explain the highest protection obtained using C -SE indirectly. Especially because C -SE film has higher O2P and lower antioxidant -DPPH , but SE has much more active compounds drom lipid fraction and caffeine content s, besides to a higher release of phenol ics to ethanol 95%. These last parameter s seem to contribute to a h igher protection from oxidation. In dir ect contact with fish oil ( Fig. 4B), the decreased formation of peroxides by active films was much lower (< 28% in comparison with control open to ambient atmosphere) than in the indirect configuration. This can be expl ained because there was no significan t migration of antioxidant compounds from the film matrix into the fish oil. These findings are in line with those previously reported in the release section (3.7),", "139 where migration of antioxidants was much lowed in etha nol. Additionally, low amount of anti oxidants were also reported in GCO. Direct immersion of pure residue extracts (SE and CE) into fish oil led to higher reduction of PV than direct contact with active films. Indeed, 44.3 % and 30.3% of PV reduction in com parison with control was obtained at the end of the storage period, with pure residue extracts of SE and CE, respectively. Again, it is important to note that direct immersion of pure residue extracts of SE and CE in the oil was much less effective than in direct protection with th e active films.", "3.7.2 Thiobarbituric acid -reactive substances (TBARS)", "The TBARS method measured the extent of secondary lipid oxidation products that are formed by decomposition of hydroperoxides by means of β-scission reactions. The TBARS values of fish oil sample s with lids of activ e films C -SE and C -CE (indirect mode) were effectively decreased in comparison with the film control (C -G-L) and fish oil control (256.5; 305.9; 532.5 and 1273.9 mg eq MDA/kg oil, respectively) (Fig. 4C). This indicates a decr ease in the formation of secondary oxidation products by Again, and similarly to the observed for primary products (PV), direct contact of the film or pure GCO residues with fish oil was muc h less effective than ind irect protection by the active film. By direct contact with fish oil, we only detected a significant tendency to delay fish oil oxidation with SE, which suggested that lower polarity compounds from the lipid fraction of green coffe e (e.g. tocopherols and diterpenes) and caffeine could act as antioxidants in the oil phase. In addition, it would be highly desirable that film C -CE, with superior CGA content, released these polar compounds at the oil -air interface, where most oxidation occurs . However, this effect was not observed.", "According to Akhtar et al., ( 2014) the most appropria te way to control lipid oxidation may be to decrease light exposure and oxygen by appl ying suitable O2 scavenging -active packaging. Our results with C-SE and C -CE films, in indirect protection support this hyp othesis. The formation of both primary and seco ndary oxidation products in fish oil were greatly delayed along the storage period with the use of both active films as lids coupled to inert headspace .", "147 oxidative deterioration using edible films and coatings: A review.

Globally, cake extract produced films with superior features such as antioxidant activity, rate of polar phenolic release, flexibility, transparency and minor changes o n surface morphology an d color parameters . Conversely , sediment extract provided films with very high UV -Vis absorption capacity, higher release of antioxidant compounds in food fat simulant and better protect ive effect from oxidation . The use of lecithin along with the polar residues extracts and non -polar components (GCO) led to obtain films with good hydrophilic/hydrophobic distribution in the film network.", "The very low values of transmittance could be explained by intermolecular bou nds formed between CMC and CGA, as well as by the presence of compounds from the lipid fraction such diterpenes (cafestol and kahweol), tocopherols and linoleic acid. Both CGA and compounds from the lip id fraction are able to absorb UV radiation . We conclu de that CGA and lip id fraction would contribute evenly and to half of the transmittance roughly. The water vapour and oxygen permeability of films were not improved by the addition of residue extracts and GCO. But at least , the good oxygen barrier of CMC f ilms was not affect ed negatively despite the slight tendency to increase , only film C -SE was significantly different (p<0.05). This probably due to the diffusion of oxygen molecules mediated by lipid components in the active film matrix.

Thus, the way how residues ex tract was incorporated into films is crucial for antioxidant capacity. The addition of dr ied/concentrate GCO residue extracts in CMC aqueous solution developed more interactions between antioxidants compounds and CMC contributing to a better protection of the functionality of C GA during film formation and conditioning and it boosted the antioxidant efficiency of C-CE and C -SE active films .", "C-SE and C -CE films in indirect contact with fish oil showed decreased PV values between 80 to 90% in comparison with the control sample cove red with aluminium foil (33.0; 67.2 and 364.2 Meq O 2/kg, respectively) at the end of the storage period as well as a decrease in the formation of secondary oxidation products by 80% (C -SE), 76% (C -CE).

The two works were composed at the end of the 19th century and present, in a broad spectrum, similarities in relation to the processes of obtaining their main themes from the gradual development of an initial group of basic ideas. In other words, both thematic structures would have been organically conceived by the use of developing variation techniques from their respectiv e origins, or Grundgestalten .", "Formulated by the Austrian composer Arnold Schoenberg (1874 -1951), the principles of developing variation and Grundgestalt have originated from an organic conception of musical creation, based on Organicism, a philosophical -scientific trend that strongly influenced part of the Austro -German Romanticism (MEYER, 1989, p.163 -217). According to our understanding, for Schoenberg, the Grundgestalt of a given musical pi ece corresponds to a sort of “common denominator” as a glance of the whole work, which would appear in the composer’s mind as a flash – the Idea [ die Idee ] – encompassing, at least in theory, all of its possible outcomes. The concept would therefore keep close relations with the organic growth metaphor from a seed (…). The extraction of this material would take place through intense and extremely dynamic derivative processes, sequentially and recursively applied (or else, variations over variations), for an indefinite number of “generations” of variants, that would corre spond to the techniques of developing variation.1", "Since the ela boration of these concepts, organic creation has been arousing considerable interest among academic researchers which has significantly intensified in the last decades. This can be observed i n studies written by Epstein (1980), Carpenter (1983), Neff (1984), Dahlhaus (1990) and Dudeque (2003; 2005 a), among others. The main focus of these research ers has been precisely on the music composed by Brahms, considered by Schoenberg as the most refine d composer in the use of melodic -thematic developmental techniques.2", "1 \"Para Schoenberg, portanto, a Grundgestalt (termo que pode ser livremente traduzido como “formato primordial”) de uma determinada peça musical corresponderia a uma espécie de denominador comum da visão do todo da obra, que surgiria na mente do compositor co mo um lampejo – a Ideia [die Idee] – contendo, ao menos em tese, todos os seus pos síveis desdobramentos. O conceito, portanto, guardaria estreitas relações com a metáfora do crescimento orgânico a partir de uma semente ou, em termos atuais, das instruções construtivas presentes no DNA . A extração desse material seria efetivada por inter médio de processos derivativos intensos e extremamente dinâmicos, aplicados sequencial e recursivamente (ou seja, variações sobre variações), por um número indefinido de “ger ações” de derivantes, o que corresponderia às técnicas de variação progressiva .\" (MAYR, 2015b, p.51, translation from the original in Portuguese).", "2 See especially the essay Brahms, the progressive (SCHOENBERG, 1984, p.398 -441), whose original version, dated from 1933 , was a broadcast lecture at Frankfurt Radio commemorating Brahms ’ birth centennial.", "Recently, various academic works have pro posed analyti cal investigations into Brahms’ organic constructive proc esses.3 The arous al of this interest, even though it can be indirectly attri buted to considerations presented by Schoenberg, has a more recent origin in the influent ial book Brahms and t he Principle of Developing V ariation (FRISCH, 1984). This work is one of the main reference sources that support this research. Its author, Walter Frisch, points to Op.78 as a model example of the use of developing variation. According to him, Brahms reach ed the intellectual summit in the use of the technique in this work, which became “a fully continuous process, one capable of generating an entire sonata exposition” (Ibid, p.120). Frisch suggests that the main factors which contribute to the formation of the developing -variation style of Brahms are the improvement and refinement of three specific procedures, namely: the technique of linkage , the co mbination of thematic and developing transformations, and the intensive use of metrical manipulations. The pre sent study examines in detail each of these three procedures, adding to them a fourth complementary topic: the correlations between organic musica l creation and biological evolutionary processes. The theoretical investigation regarding these conceptual ele ments aims at incorporating them into the analytical model used in the research.", "Another text which is central for the assumptions that are adopte d in this research is the present author’s Masters dissertation (MAYR, 2015b). This study demonstrates that th e eight themes which form the sonata structure of Op.14’s first movement maintain mutual and close affinity relations, being derived from a group of six motivic ideas present in the first four bars. According to Schoenberg’s terminology, these components c onstitute the piece’s Grundgestalt .", "It is also possible to notice in Op.14 that the basic motives – in varied formats and contexts – are also pres ent in the remaining three movements of the piece. This fact represents a meaningful connection between the two sonatas , to which it is possible to add another two: (a) both works are considered the first violin sonatas composed by Brahms and Miguéz ,4 and (b) they were written with a time span difference of only six years: 1878 (the Op.78) and 1884 Based on these considerations, some important questions can be formulated:", "3Among others: MUSGRAVE (198 0), BURTS (2004), AUERBACH (2005), NG (2005), EMBRY (2007), 4The Sonata Op.78 was the first to be published, but the fourth to be composed. The three previous are not considered, a s: one was lost and two were destroyed by the composer (EASTHAM, 2007, p.126).", "(1) Would it be possible to systemize the thematic derivative analysis of a work organically constructed, considering a large -scale perspective?5 (2) Taking into account the basic h ypothesized similarities in relation to the derivative processes adopted in the two sonatas, would it be possible to find, define and catalog specif ic common or particular procedures applied in their construction?", "(3) As a consequence, the eventual recogn ition of consistent intersections between the procedures could imply the influence of the German composer on the Brazilian, reinforcing the hypothes is raised by Mayr (2015b) in the conclusions of her study? The general objectives of this work aim t o contri bute to the expansion of knowledge about : the Brazilian romantic musical period; the creative processes adopted by Leopoldo Miguéz in his chamber wo rks; the theories of Grundgestalt and Developing Variation; and t he Organic musical construction, under an a nalytical perspective. More specifically, there are six objectives that can be added, namely:", "1. To systematically map the constructive procedures in the thematic construction employed by both composers, classifying similarities and particularities; 2. To discuss the presence of organi c constructive conception in Brazilian R omanticism; 3. To investigate if the formal and harmonic dimensions a lso act in the organic structural process in large scale, in one or both sonatas; 4. To examine alternatives to the traditional German organicist practice;6 5. To expand the derivative analysis model that will be used in the research,7 with t he incorporation an d formalization of Brahmsian techniques and procedures described by Frisch (1984), evolutionary -like processes, beside s others, to be eventually detected; 6. To create computational tools for the analytical work , especially intended for graphical representati on of the genea logical relations between variants, contemplating their distinct hierarchical levels .", "The trajectory and, especially, Miguéz ’s musica l work are topics not yet profoundly studied. Little is known, in fact, about his compositional studies . Even though it is alleged that it was consolida ted during his trips to Europe, there is not enough consistent documentation about possible teachers or formal study periods. Apart from that, it has been", "5For F risch (as it is recurrently ment ioned in his book), using the evidence of developing variation as a structured element of a complete work would be the most significant pur pose in a derivative analysis. 6 For exa mple, the American composer William S chuman (1910 -1992), studied by Richard Pye (2000), and the Brazilian Alberto Nepomuceno (1864 -1920), an alyzed by Norton Dudeque (2005b). 7 To be described in the meth odology sec tion.", "constantly repeated (since the time in which he wa s actively composing) that Migué z was strongly influenced by the New German School aesthetics and, specifically, by Richard Wag ner (1813 -1883) and Franz Liszt (1811 -1886).8 However, this information is hardly corroborate d by technical and analytical data or proven by pure music al facts.9 One of the main aims of the mentioned dissertation on Miguéz’s Sonata Op.14 (MAYR, 2015b) was precisely a contribution to fill this gap.10 That study examined the correlations between t he form, harmony and thematic structure of the piece’s first movement, and can be considered as the first stage of a broad, pioneer mapping of Miguéz’s compositional proceedings. In this way, the analytical results obtained became technical parameters for further studies on other works written by the composer. The p resent proposal aims not only to continue this process of expansion of the knowledge on Miguéz’s creative practice but also to extend the analytical process from the sonata’s first movement to the complete piece, a necessary step for the adequate investiga tion of the influence of the organicist procedures on the whole musical structure.", "On the other hand, it is possible to associate four arguments based on considerations previously presented in this project, as the main reasons for the choice of Brahms’ Op. 78 to integrate the comparative study which forms the nucleus of this research: (a) Both sonatas present an o rganic thematic construction in their respective first movements, and in both cases, there is evidence that this type of organization11 extends to the o ther movements; (b) Brahms is admittedly the most prominent master of organic construction in German romantic ism, Op.78 being, according to Frisch, a model case of developing variation techniques, especially from a structural perspective; (c) As far as it is known , there are no academic analytical studies of the Op.78 related to thematic derivation;12 (d) Both works are of the same genre and almost contemporary.", "8 See, for example, VOLPE (2001) e ANDRADE (2013). 9 As an exception, see DUDEQUE (2014).", "10As argued by Maria Alice Volpe (2000, p.36), this problem is associated not only to Migué z’s work, bu t also to the entire Brazilian R omantic musical period, in serted between two other periods that are contempla ted by a considerable number of academic stud ies: the Colonial (18th-19th centuries) and the Modernist -Nationalist (from 11This assumption is based on considerations presented by Frisch (1984 , p.97 and 116 -120), concerning Op.78, and Mayr (2015b), in re gards to Op. 14. 12Evidently, disregarding the brief analysis present in Frisch´s book.", "Taking into account all of these reasons , one can envisage an attractive and rare opportunity for the compar ison of the constructive processes employed with the same basic finality, contemplating distinct so lutions under more detailed perspectives. Considering the aspect of the methodology, t he research will be done considering the following stages:", "1.

The model has as its theoretical referential the Schoenbergian principles of developing variation and Grundgestalt .", "The thesis is structured in an introduction (number ed as 1) and six great sections (chapters 2 to 7) . In the chapter 2 , it is presented a brief contextualization of both sonatas. Chapter 3 addresses the main theoretical framework, comprising an overview of the trend of Organicism, and Schoenberg’s principl es of Grundgestalt and developing variation, as well as some origina l correlated formulations. Chapter 4 is dedicated to the structural analysis of the pieces, considering essentially form and tonal relations. The model of derivative analysis is described in chapter 5, being applied to both sonatas in chapter 6 (Op.78) and chapter 7", "2 CONTEXTUALIZATION", "Leopoldo Americo Miguéz (b. , Niterói, 1850, d. , Rio de Janeiro, 1902) spent part of his childhood in Spain and Portugal where he initiated his musical studies. Back in Rio, in 1871, he continued to develop his musical activities at the same time as he worked in his family’s business. In 1876, at the ag e of 26, he made his debut as a composer and conducto r with the Orquestra Filarmônica Fluminense . In 1882, he conducted his B  major Symphony in the presence of the Brazilian Emperor, Pedro II. Probably as a result of this performance Pedro II recommended Miguéz to study with Ambroise Thomas, director of the Paris Conservatoire, in September of that year (CORRÊA, 2005, p.28) . During his stay in Paris, Miguéz met some renown composers such as Vincent D’Indy and César Franck. When he returned to Brazil, he became a follower of the Republican party and helped fo ment various activities in the musical scenario of the city, especially a ssociated with the so -called “music of the future” (we will return to this point later). Recognized as one of the greatest composers from the Brazilian Romantic period, Miguéz wrote t wo symphonies, two operas, a number of orchestral pieces and three sympho nic poems, besides several songs, and chamber music, among them the Sonata Op.14 for violin and piano in A major.", "On November 15th, 1889, after 67 years of monarchy, the Republic of Brazil was established. Just a week after this event, the new government promoted a contest destined to choose the music for the country’s new national anthem. In spite of Miguéz’s composition being the winner, the public opinion reacted against the substi tution of the traditional Brazilian anthem (composed in 1881 by Joaquim O sório and Francisco Manuel da Silva), which was as popular then and as it is now. The solution for this polemic was to maintain the traditional hymn and attribute to Miguéz’s music th e title of Anthem of the Republic. As a Republican, Miguéz was named the first director of the newly established National Institution of Music (INM), former Imperial Institute of Music and nowadays the School of Music of the Federal University of Rio de Ja neiro. Miguéz substantially altered the program and philosophy that had b een employed in the institute until then, changing the teaching orientation predominant in the Monarchy years, which was dedicated to instructing musicians for performing primordialit y in theatres and churches. Rather, he intensely promoted instrumental mu sic, both chamber and symphonic, especially based on German and", "15 This section is based on elements of chapter 1 of MAYR ( 2015b, p.11 -19).", "French traditions (MAGALDI, 1994, p.13 -14). In 1895, aiming especially at enhancing the teaching practice of the Instit ute, he travel led again to Europe and visited sixteen conservatoires amon g four countries (France, Belgium, Germany , and Italy). His main purpose was to collect information for a detailed report, which was submitted to the governmental authorities back in Brazil.16 In this report , Miguéz criticizes the Italian conservatoires for the lack of discipline and those in Paris for “promiscuity” between male and female students. On the other hand, the German and Belgian schools are praised for “order and discipline, and rigor in the control of the school’s statistics” (VERMES, 2004, p.5). Summing up, it is possible to interpret this duality Italy/German as also projected in the field of musical aesthetics. In other words, if on one side the Italian school (which can be mainly linked to operatic production) is associated with the decadent principles – in Miguéz’s and the Republican’s thought – of the monarchy, the instrumental music of German orientation adjusts perfectly to the new political ideals.", "The beginning of the Republic brought profound changes to Brazil, not only in the politic al scenario but also in the social philosophic and cultural fields, encompassing evidently the music. Substituting the preference of the Imperial Era for Italian opera, new sources of influence arose with the Republican movement, even before the change of regime. Such influence can ultimately be associated with ideals syntoni zed with profound transformations of the European thought at the turn of the century, especially synthesized by the Positivism , a trend idealized by the French Auguste Co mte (1798 -1857) . The Positivist principles seem perfectly adjusted to the Republican project of promoting modernization, civilization , and education to the Brazilian people. The INM under the direct ion of Miguéz became a center of implementation of these transformations in the musical ambit. As if searching for a rupture with the links from the Monarchist past, the Brazilian music, according to the new orientation, would need to be reborn. For Volpe (2001, p.32), the ideal musical expression of the new regime was associat ed with the so -called music of the future , which essentially corresponded to the Wagnerian aesthetics. In this epoch , one can observe an increase in the number of symphonic concerts i n Rio de Janeiro (until then, the theatres were almost exclusively dedicated to operas) and the creation of music appreciation clubs (like the Club Beethoven , also in Rio). Supporting this, Volpe (1994, p.149) affirms that chamber music in Brazil starts to be intensely developed from 1880 onwards, being adopted by the", "16 For further comments about this report see VERMES (2004).", "main composers of the epoch, Alberto Nepomuceno (1864 -1920), Glauco Velásquez (1884 - 1914), Henrique Oswald (1852 -1931) and Mig uéz.", "Curiously, such preference for instrumental music, Germanism , and Wagnerism (which together represented the concept of the music of the future), was introduced in Brazil by “French ideary” (ANDRADE, 2013, p.111). Despite how paradoxical this may seem , a strong German influence (including in the domain of music) aro use in France after the humiliating defeat suffered by this country in the French -Prussian War of 1871. According to Andrade (2013, pp.151 -3), the reasons of this influence resulted in fact from a profound prospection about the causes of the surprising los s (under the perspective of France, the most powerful European nation then), are a deep examination of conscience that involved part of the society. For French analysts, cultural and attitud inal differences between the people of both countries were the pos sible causes. Thus, for them, German’s discipline, rigor, morality, determination, and education would have been decisive factors for the Prussian victory, in front of the decadence, immoral ity, and indiscipline of the French.", "Maybe the strongest role of German influence among the French, in the musical field, was Richard Wagner. As an example, it is well known the impact suffered by Debussy concerning the striking innovations present in the opera Tristan und Isolde , especially manifested through the famou s “Tristan chord”, employed as a symbol or veiled quotation in several works of the French composer. Other important names of the French -spoken musical scenario who orbited around the Wagner ian attraction were Vincent D’Indy and César Franck. As mentioned previously, it was in the final last quarter of the 19th century that Miguéz obtained part of his compositional formation, especially in Paris and Brussels. It seems plausible to suppose tha t he could also be influenced by such process of Germanization of the French musical culture. Besides Wagner, the Hungarian Franz Liszt is frequently mentioned as an important stylistic reference for Miguéz.17 From an alternative approach, established initi ally as a hypothesis in a previous study by the present author (MA YR, 2015b), a new possible influential pole started to be considered for Miguéz’ style, the Organicist -Formalist tradition of German music, especially", "17See for example Neves (1981, p.18), and especially Dudeque (2014), who analyzes the symphonic poem Promethée composed by Miguéz in 1899, comparing it to the homonymous work of same genre by Liszt (written in 1850). Dudeque poin ts several structural, com positional procedures and harmonic/thematic construction similarities between both poems, suggesting that the influential relation could be more consistent than purely esthetical.", "personified in the names of Beethoven a nd Brahms.18 The present study is strongly based on this belief, as it will be presented along the chapters.", "Although there is divergence about its exact date of composition,19 the Violin Sonata Op.14 is chronologically close to Brahms’ s first work of the s ame genre, Op.78. It is considered the first violin sonata compos ed in Brazil (PONTES, 2012, p.34), being premiered on July 12th, 1886, in the Club Beethoven of Rio de Janeiro performed by Miguéz himself playing the violin and Arthur Napoleão at the piano (VOLPE, 1994, p.139). The Op.14 has four movements (I: sonata fo rm; II: ternary; III: scherzo; IV: rondo -sonata) and is written in A major.", "Johannes Brahms was born in Hamburg, Germany, on May 7th, 1833. He initiated his piano studies at a young age and played his first con cert when he was 10 years old. As his father, Johannes acted as a professional musician in taverns, which gave him experience in improvisation and probably a remarkable knowledge about popular rhythms, marked by strong and displaced accents , something that influenced deeply his music . During this time, he met the famous violinist Joseph Joachim, who would later premier some of his main violin compositions. In 1853, he traveled to D üsseldorf to visit Robert and Clara Schumann, who impressed by the works writ ten by that 20 -year-old young man, immediately adopted him as a pupil and a friend for life .", "It is in that same year that Schumann named Brahms as a “musical messiah”, and the initiator of the Neue Bahnen (new paths), placing “him squarely in opposition t o the ethos of program music” (PARMER, 2007, p.109). In 1860 Brahms signed a manifesto, in which “seemed to denounce the aesthetic value of that group of composers to whom Karl Fr anz Brendel referred collectively in 1859 as the ‘New German School’ (i.e., L iszt, Be rlioz, and Wagner) while Brahms’s eventual endorsement of Eduard Hanslick (…) and Schumann” (ibid., p.109). Brahms was considered in his time and even several decades afte r his death (in 1897) as a conservative composer in comparison with the “prog ressive” Wagner and Liszt . Criticized as a formalist and anachronistically “classical” in an epoch when the traditional", "18Considering the lack of precise information abou t Miguéz musical formation (the consulted texts are with no exception vague and limited concerning this subject), the investigation of this hypothesis might be exclusively supported by the structural analysis. The results obtained point consistently to the plausibility of a Brahmsi an influence on Miguéz’s chamber music (at least, this is the case in the sonata). 191885 for Corrêa (2005, p.29) or 1884 for Volpe (2000, p.43).

The author adds that Brahms himself cons idered “the lovely natural surroundings” as inspiring for the composition. The piece is inserted in Brahms’ intermediary period (considering the classification proposed by Malcolm MacDonald, 1990), comprising works written between 1876 and 1882.21 According to Eastman (2007, p.126), the Op.78 was the first of the three Brahms’ sonat as to be published, but not the first to be composed. “The first one in A minor was finished before October 1853 but was lost. Two others were destroyed […] as being uns atisfactory” (Eastman apud DRINKER, 2007, p.126).", "As it will be discussed in chapter 6, the Op.78 was based on the initial melody of a previous Brahms’ song, Regenlied (Rain song) Op.59/3 , composed in 187 3 (for this reason, the piece is sometimes referred as the “Rain Sonata”). Besides this, so to speak, endemic origin, Parmer and Grimes (2 009) investigate possible external inspirations for the piece . As the authors argue, there are strong pieces of evidence that both violin sonatas , Beethoven ’s Op.96 ( nicknamed as “Spring”) and Mozart ’s K.379 , were sources of influence for the Op.78. Not on ly due to the fact they were also written in G major and that they have in the incipit of their first editions (as in the case of Brahms) references to Goethe texts, but for more technical structural similarities , exposed in details in the article (ibid., p.140 -4). Another possible compositional motivation, according to Eastman (2007, p.126), would be the death of Brahms’ godson Felix Schumann, at the age of 24. For Eastm an, “the sonata reflects Brahms’ sadness [although] the overall effect of the work coul d be described as tender, rather than despondent”.", "The Op.78 was premiered by Brahms’ on the piano and Joseph Hellmesberger on the violin in 1879.

As it will be later demonstrated, the Op.78 presents a notable formal -harmonic integration and an extraordinary economy in the f ormation of its themes. As stated by Frisch (1984, p.120), the sonata’s “harmonic language is not especially remarkable, but the purely horizontal dimension unfolds with the sophistication and flexibility that Brahms himself was never to surpass”. Moreover , “in the G -Major Violin Sonata, developing variation seems to have at last become a fully continuous process, one capable of ge nerating an entire sonata exposition”.", "3 THEORETICAL FOUNDATIONS", "The principles of Grundgestalt and develo ping variation can be perhaps considered as the most important concepts of the vast theoretical work of Arnold Schoenberg.

According to Sérgio Freitas (2012, p.65 - 66), the origins of organicist thinking can be establishe d from very remote times. Concepts such as unity, relation between the whole and its parts, organic growth, functional organization of the elements, concinnity ,23 among other correlations were present already in Antiquity in the thinking of Socrates, Plato and Aristotle, remaining as a philosophical tradition throughout the Middle Age, registered, among others, in the writing of Saint Augustine and reaching its apogee in the 19th century with reflexes that last up to today. In spite of such remote antecedent s, the Organicism flourished especi ally in the 1800s, associated with the romantic Zeitgeist , especially German. Its bases, according to Meyer (1989, p.163 -217), can be conne cted to the concepts of geniality, originality, spontaneity, inspiration, egalitarianism, neutralism, as well as the non -contextualism, the renouncement of the conventions and the notion of Becoming as oppose to Being , which had predominated in the precede nt period, under the illuminist orientation. Such opposition, seen under t he specific prism of the artistic creation would denote a change in referential, of the idealized complete work to that unfinished or open, especially valuing the gradual transformat ion as the preferential means of construction. According to the same autho r,", "22 Part of this section was presented in ALMADA & MAYR (2014b). 23From the Latin concinnitas , meaning “elegance”.", "“Organicism was crucial for the history of music because it furnishes the central metaphors for Romantic aesthetic s”, being strongly associated with the ideas of “gradual transfor mation, (…), progressive development, (…) and continuous Becoming”, confir ming that its influence would persist up to today, in the most varied aspects of everyday life , as for example, in the concerns with nature, in the hippie culture or in the avant -garde music (Ibid., pp.180 and In the same way that occurred in relatio n to various areas of knowledge (architecture, sociology, literature etc.), an organicist concept in the musical creation caused intense and decisive developments. As recognized by J oseph Kerman (1987, p.83 ), although in a critical manner , “none of the art s was more profoundly affected by the ideology of the organicism than music”. The idea that a musical work develops, so to speak , biologically, in fact, can be considered almost comm on sense nowadays, although rarely is it treated with the necessary depth.", "Implicitly associating this concept to the revolutionary works of Goethe and Darwin about the biological and evolutionary nature of the musical creation, Meyer affirms that “ the org anic form (…) is innate; it shapes as it develops itsel f from within, and the fullness of its development is one and the same with the perfection of its outward form” (SCHLEGEL apud MEYER, 1989, p.190).). Meyer also mentions that “there is a continuing process in which the innate potentialities of nature gradually realize themse lves” (Ibid. p.196). According to Devon Burts (2005, p.7 -8), Goethe represented a strong influence not only in the consolidation of the musical organism, as well as in the conception of the principle of Grundgestalt . His research into the nature of plants led him to the formulation of the Gestalt concept (that wo uld have important development in psychological and cognitive theories in the 20th century), relating to the immediate seizu re of a configuration by the senses, and the idea that the form of the whole can be defined from its integrating parts. Freitas (2012, p.68) considers that the two names that best represent the theorization of the musical organicist principles are perhaps the most influential in the theorist -musical scenery of the 20th century: Heinrich Schenker (1868 -1935) and Arnold Schoe nberg (1874 -1951). Each elaborated a theory strongly linked to the organic conception of the musical phenomena: respectively, of the Fundamental Structure (Ursatz ) and of the Grundgestalt .", "The formulation of the principle of Grundgestalt can be credited to a synthesis between practice and theory. Well before the concept had been conceived, Schoenberg employed this in his music, in an intense and sophisticated manner, an organic musical const ruction, which shows some derivative analys is25 of the works from his tonal phase There are divergences in re lation to the date in which it would have been for the first time conceptually mentioned in a text by Sc hoenberg: 1913 (DUDEQUE, 2005 a), “around 1915 ” (LEIGH, 1998), 1919 (RUFER , 1954) or “in the beginning of the 1920’s” (COLLEEN, 2009).26 However, almost a ll the authors considered , agree that the main motivation for Schoenberg to theorize a practice , that fo r him was spontaneous and characteristic , was associated with giving support to his serial method which, at that time, was about to be formalized.27 In other words, the composer seemed to feel the necessity to express that his music carried on as before, in spite of the change of idiom, strongly based on the unity of the theme, as well as in its multiple variet ies, obtained from gradual and progressive transformation.", "Although from the beginning, it had been an important trace of its creative personality, Schoenberg never produced a sufficiently precise definition of the compositional process trigge red by the Grundgestalt , as has been pointed out by some recent commentators.

These elements can be considered as concrete unities (conventional motives for exa mple) and/or structures based on abstract attributes, involving intervalli c or durational sequences, tonal relations, metric configurations, etc. The Grundgestalt acts, therefore, as a seed of an organically -constructed composition providing not only the n eeded material for themes and subsidiary elements but also the adequate me ans for its structuring.", "Based on what was presented in this section, we can formulate the following considerations:", "1. According to Schoenbergian understanding, a musical work might be preceded by what he denominated the Idea, a sort of instantaneous prev iew of the entire composition in broad lines , and as an abstract conception. Retrospectively considered, the Grundgestalt would then form a group of t he minimum musical elements whic h, potentially, would be able to generate the whole piece – in other words , realize the Idea – from the numerous", "derivative unfolding, which represents the concrete dimension of the organic compositional process; 2. Another perspective to take into account in the genesis of the Grundgestalt is the relation between theory and practi ce. In this respect, we can consider Schoenberg’s motivation for the elaboration of the concept (i.e., as a theoretical support for serial music) and the fact that his organic compos itional practice considerably preceded the principle formulation, these fa ctors being profoundly influenced by Romantic organicist thinking and, especially, by Brahms’ derivative treatment. It is relevant to add that both elements can be associated with th e concept of “themati cism”, central to the understanding of Schoenberg’s m usic, which in turn involve the double balance between coherence/unity and variety/contrast. The following section proposes an investigation into the relevance of this compositional factor on the creation of Grundgestalt .", "The essence of the proposal presented here is based on a simple and logical argument: at least one decade before the first known theoretical formulations of the concept of Grundgestalt , Schoenberg had already been using in his compositions sophisticated means of organic construction, through formatting thematic ideas by the intense development of basic musical elements. In other words, it is suggested that the concretion of this principle as a concept was rather externalized, as a habitual aspect of the composer’s nature, rather than properly theorized, in the common sense of the term. This hypothesis w ould in part contribute to explain the reasons of the previously mentioned inconsistenc ies of Schoenberg’s first definitions about the subjec t, which could be seen as comprehensible difficulties for conceptualizing internal (and intuitive) procedures as fo rmal entities. Taking this assumption as a point of departure, we can consider that the origins of the basic idea of Grundgestalt could be tr aced back to Schoenberg’s tonal phase (1893 - 1908),36 which is clearly demonstrated in analytical studies concerned w ith the thematic construction of some representative works from this period .37 One of the most impressive cases of organic formulation occurre nce in a Schoenbergian tonal piece can be observe d in the First Chamber Symphony Op.9, composed", "35Part of the content of this section was published in MAYR (2016). 36According to Walter Frisch’s subdivision of Schoenberg’s creative periods ( FRISCH, 1993, p.xv ).", "in 1906.38 Figure 1 presents (in analytical reduction) the initial bars of the Symphony , which represent exactly its Grundgestalt .", "Figure 1: Schoenberg – First Chamber Symphony (mm.1 -5): the Grundgestalt (adapted from ALMADA, 2011, Four basic, abstract components can be identified in this Grundgestalt : the descending melodic interval of minor ninth (A), the hexachord formed by the superposition of five perfect fourths (B), the hexachord formed by the notes of the whole -tone scale (C) , and the chromatic descending bass line (D). Reflecting intensely an economic and organic construction, this group of four components is reused in different formats and deri vations forming the main themes39 and in the melodic -harmonic structure of the piec e, which reveals their structural importance and germinal character.", "The first thematic idea appears immediately after the introduction/ Grundgestalt , as an unaccompanied unis on of the two French horns ( Fig.2). Its melodic structure is simply the (transposed) horizontal unfolding of component B, a sequence of fourths. From the concretion of this melodic -harmonic material , two new elements are abstracted, rhythmic in this case: Z and Y.40 The resultant thematic structure will from now on be labeled a s “Fourths Theme” (Ft).", "38The Symphony is written for 15 soloists (pi ccolo, flute, oboe, English horn, clarinet, bass clarinet, bassoon, double -bassoon, two French horns and a string quintet), consisting of a single movement of 596 bars, subdivided into five large parts that delineate a complex compact structure in sonata -form interpolated by a scherzo and an adagio .

Its initial phrase (which virtually represents Mt in various passages along the piece) is shown in Figure 3a. As it can be observed, it also unfolds a basic hexachord of the Grundgestalt , in this case , the whole -tone collection (C). In the rhythmic aspect, the phrase can be viewed as having an implicit infrastructure based on Z (see the small notes in Figure 3a), concluding with Y (like Ft).

Accordingly, it is possible to consider this variant as resulting from a combined process of segmentation (with the selection", "of the two first fourths of B) and deformation (the second interval becomes an augmented fourth). This intervallic abstr action, transposed and with a new rhythmic context (which in turn is derived from Y) is reused by Schoenberg as anacrusis of the “Lyric Theme” (Lt),41 whose initial phrase is shown in Figure 4.", "Figure 4 : Schoenberg – First Chamber Symphony (mm.85 -87): Th e Lyric Theme (phrase 1).", "The second part of the Symphony (in C minor) starts in m.160 with the Scherzo Theme (St), which has an essential portion of its pitch structure based on elaborations of the abstract elements A and D ( Figure 5).", "Figure 5 : Schoe nberg – First Chamber Symphony (mm.160 -167): The Scherzo T heme (excerpt).", "Finally, the main theme from the Adagio (At), which initiates the fourth part of the work (c.382), refers to various basic components ( Figure 6).", "41According to Schoenberg’s terminology (1990) , based on the classical -romantic tradition, to desig nate the mai n theme of the Thematic Secondary Group in a sonata form.", "Figure 6 : Schoenberg – First Cham ber Symphony (mm.382 -387): The Adagio Theme.

In our understanding, this double approach, considering both conceptual preced encies, contributes to a more consistent, objective and embracing prospection of this important subject.", "3.2 Developing Variation", "The principle of devel oping variation (shortly, DV) is complementary to the concept of Grundgestalt and also originated from Schoenberg's personal conception of organic musical creation. Unlike Grundgestalt , however, the genesis of DV was more straightforward, since its elabora tion did not involve complex theoretical formulation and conflicting and/or overlapping concepts.

Three of them are presented", "43It is almost needless to add that at that time the use of DV (as its counterpart, the Grundge stalt principle) had been a consolidated and characteristic part of Schoenberg’s musical practice. 44As pointed by Dudeque in his b ook, Rosemary Hilmar (1984) exami nes several of Berg’s notebooks from the period when he was student of Schoenberg.", "below, besides other definitions and general comments from some of the authors considered in the previous section of this chapter.", "Def.1 (SCHOENBERG, 1990, p.8) :", "▪ [DV] \"means that in the succession of motive -forms produced through variation of the basic motive, there is something which can be compared to development, to growth.

Comment : Frisch attributes Brahms’ music as the main inspiration source for the elaboration of the concept. He also associates DV with musical prose.45 For Frisch (1984, p.8 -9), “developing variation and musical prose are, in a sense two different ways of describing the same process. Developing variation – the principles according to which ideas are continuously varied – provides the grammar by which the musical prose is created”.", "▪ [DV is the process] \"in which thematic materials are generated from the continuous modification of a very few motivic ideas\".", "▪ \"Developing variation is a special category of variation technique, one that implies a teleological process. As a result, later events – even markedly contrasting ones – can be understood as originate from, or grow out of, changes that were made in the repetitions of early musical unities. Therefore, true developing variation can be distinguished from purely local varied repetitions that have no developmental consequences. Developing variation offers the possibility of forwards motion, permi tting the creation of new or contrasting (but still related) ideas, while local variation affects only the passage in question\".", "Comment : Definition 6, 7 do not bring anything new, but serve to reinforce the main aspects of DV: its association with the Grundgestalt /Idea as a gradual and progressive process .

The process graduall y moves away from the Grundgestalt in concentric circles, expanding (in the thesis, at least) the divergences between the variants and the referential form.

Each of them will be examined in details in the following subsections.", "The entry “thematic transformation” in the Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians info rms that it is A term used to define the pro cess of modifying a theme so that in a new context it is different but yet manifestly made of the same elements; a variant term is ‘thematic metamorphosis’ (…). Thematic transformation is no more than a special application of the principle of variation; ye t although the technique is similar the effect is usually different, since the transformed theme has a life and independence of its own and is no longer a sibling of the original theme (…) Thematic trans formation belongs above all to the 19th century, when composers exploited through it the possibilities that arose from giving themes dramatic or human significance in instrumental or vocal music. (MacDONALD, 2001)", "According to the author, this process ori ginated in pairs of dances that normally integrated t he suites of the 17th century. Thematic transformation can be found in Beethoven’s music (for example, Pathetic Sonata and the various metamorphoses of Ode to Joy ’s theme from the Ninth Symphony ), in the recurrent Idée Fixe of Berlioz’s Symphonie Fantastiq ue and especially in Liszt’s Faust Symphony , Les Préludes , and B minor Sonata. Thematic transformation is quite a relevant topic in Frisch ’s book. He defines it as a kind of compositional technique that involves a radical change in mood and character, whil e the theme ’s basic shape, especially its pitch contour or configuration, is retained. Tempo, rhythm, meter, harmonization, dynamics, articulation all these may be altered, but the theme s till retains a recognizable Gestalt .

For Frisch, it “differs fundamentally from [thematic] 'development', in which the smallest elements of a theme – its intervals and rhythms – are continuously modified” (Ibid., p .36).", "Figure 8 outlines the graphic representations of both techniq ues. While in thematic transformation (TT) the basic idea is presented at different places in a piece reconfigured into several disguises (considering metrics, mode, tempo, etc.), but alwa ys keeping its original basic format, in thematic development (TD) n ew derived ideas are formed by gradual transformation of small motivic unities, eventually becoming reference for further derivation.", "Figure 8 : Models of thematic transformation (a) and thematic development (b).", "In Frisch’s understanding (Ibid., p.42 -3), Beethoven provides “one of the first – and certainly one of the most striking – manifestations of [thematic] transformation” in the Piano Concerto Op.37, which is illustrated in his example 13 and adapted in our Figure 9.", "Figure 9 : Beethoven, Piano Co ncerto, op.37/III – Three instances of use of thematic transformation: mm.1 -6", "The main theme of the movement ( Figure 9a), in C minor, reappears later transfigured in another mode an d center, E major ( Figure 9b). In the coda of the movement , it is altered in mood, meter and tempo ( Figure 9c), making \"for a still more dazzling metamorphosis (…) of which even Liszt would have been proud\". (Ibid., p.43) Frisch argues that TT is, together with TD, one of the most characteristic traits of Brahms’ creative personality and an important factor for the concretion of his developing - variation style. How paradoxically this may sound (after all, TT is normally associated with superficial thematic e mbellishments), we can see in Frisch ’s comment the emerging of a new, sophisticated developmental treatment. For him, “ Brahms attempts to reconcile the principles of thematic development and thematic transformation”, with this reconciliation assuming diffe rent aspects along his career.", "In one of Brahms’ initial w orks, the Piano Sonata Op.5 (composed in 1853, when he was 20 -years old) it is possible to observe, according to Frisch, what may be the first combined use of both techniques, although, in this cas e, TT plays a more prominent role than TD. In his words, Brahms ’s procedure in op.5 is essentially that of thematic transformation (…), which here takes precedent over other techniques that Schoenberg saw as characteristic of Brahms [i.e., TD]. The first m ovement unfolds not as an essay in thematic development, but as a series of discrete character studies of a single motive", "Just after Op.5, between 1853 and 1854, Brahms wrote the first version of his Piano Trio Op.8. The main theme of the f irst movement represents an extraordinary example of economic and organic c onstruction since its structure is obtained from \"continuous recycling of very concise thematic material\" (Ibid., p.57), as it can be observed in Figure 10 (which reproduces Frisch ’s ex.18).48", "Figure 10 : Brahms, Piano Trio, Op.8/I (original version) – Thematic development in the main theme, mm.1 -4.", "The same recitative -like theme becomes the basis for two transformed ideas in the thematic second group: themes 2a (Figure 11a), which progresses differently after repeating the same pitches and rhythm configuration of the initial full bar of the recitative, and 2b, “a theme resembling a Baroque fugue subject” ( Figure11b).", "Figure 11 : Brahms, Piano Trio, Op.8/I (o riginal version) – Thema tic trans formation from the main theme :", "In 1890 Brahms revised his Trio, which resulted in profound modifications in the second group of the movement. Comparing the original and revised versions, Frisch argues that \"the most significant difference [between them] (…) is that, in the latter, Brahms makes", "48Related to this case, Frisch mentions the comments of Carl Dahlhaus, for whom the theme results from operational transformations of the basic motive, like inversion and metrical displacement (Ibid., p.57).", "no attempt to transform his thematic shapes, to re -attire them in strongly contrasting garments, or to guide them toward melodic apotheoses\" (Ibid., p.61). The new second group is obtained through \"extensive development during the exposition\" (Ibid., p.62). In sum, the mature Br ahms decided to reformulate the balance of forces (TT x TD) established by the young Brahms in the thematic construction of his piece, which is a meaningful evidence of the tendencies of his compositional evolution.", "This impression can be reinforced in a w ork of his intermediary period, the Piano Quartet Op.25. Analyzing the manners w ith which Brahms obtains new ideas from the main theme of the first movement, Frisch affirms that here the thematic process sheds its former extravagancies [referring to Opp.5 and 8] and assumes a much sober cast. (…) Brahms no longer dazzles us with the metamorphosis of an individual motive that are themselves 'insignificant', to build larger themes. The procedure begins to suggest, however faintly, the methods of genuine deve loping variation (…). (Ibid., p.70)", "In spite of the clear predominance of TD pr ocedures in the composer ’s new conception, there is still room for TT, as it is demonstrated in the recapitulation section. Frisch asserts that its \"most striking moment is the transformation of [theme] 2c in the tonic minor (…). As in the Lisztian metamor phoses of opp.5 and 8, Br ahms radically alters the mood while retaining pitches and harmonic structure” (Ibid., p.73 -4).", "More than an isolate d fact, this new posture says much about the change of compositional orientation in Brahms ’ mind. As Frisch states, the new 2c does not emer ge from a continuous process (…), but stands as an isolated metamorphosis. Brahms has, in a sense, the best of both worlds (…). The new 2c perhaps epitomizes Brahms ’s formal and thematic procedures in op.25. Safely contained within the recapitulation, the transformation does not dominate the sonata structure, as it tended to in opp.1, 5, and 8. Indeed, the sonata design of the piano quartet is fundamentally more conservative than the earlier works in favor of a thematic -formal proce ss that is more sober and outwardly 'insignificant'. This process – in which brief motives undergo a limited development across highly articulated themes – stands midway between the continuous transformation of the op.5 Sonata and the f luid developing vari ation of both the second Piano Quartet, op.26 in A major, and the Piano Quintet, op.34 (Ibid., p.74)", "Considering the case of Op. 34, Frisch comments that for the first time in Brahms’s work, (...) thematic transformation has become an integral part of th is sonata procedure. Or w e might say the thematic transformation, motivic development, harmonic process, and formal design are at last all beautifully and powerfully coordinated. (Ibid, p.86)", "So as the time progresses Brahms integrates both TT and DT so t hat they work together. This tendency is intensified as Brahms’ style becomes more mature as it can be observed in his last period. Frisch (Ibid, p.152) examines in one of his songs, O Tod , wie", "bitter bist Du Op.121/3 ( Figure 12) a special thematic transf ormation, which he considers to be one of the “most profound” of Brahms’ music, “a transfiguration really”, since it is associated “not only [ with] the musical structure, but also the spiritual meaning of the work.”", "Figure 12 : Brahms, O Tod , wie bitter b ist Du Op.121/ 3 – Thematic transformation.: ( a) mm. 1-2 (b) mm.31 -2. Adapted from FRISCH (1984, p.152)", "Frisch points out that the choice of melodic intervals and their direction is connected to the intended sense for the word “Tod” (death), conveyed by the strophes of the poem: “bitter” in the first case, which is expressed by “harsh descending thirds”, and “hopeful” in the second, through a change of the narrator’s perspective, which is musically illustrated by “blissful ascending sixths” highlighting then the opposition o f the two views. In Frisch’s words (Ibid, p.152) “in altering the contour but retaining the interval of the third, Brahms manages to combine two of his most characteristic compositional impulses, his lifelong tendency to thematic transform ation and his lat e proclivity for themes with highly restricted intervals.” Summing up, although at first impression thematic transformation and development may seem antagonistic procedures, this biographical revision has demonstrated how Brahms assimilate d the best of bot h principles to benefit his constructive intentions. Moreover, his compositional trajectory is marked by an oscillating balance between TT and DT: favoring the former in the earlier period, giving greater importance to the latter in the intermediary phase, culminating with a perfect synthesis of both in the last works. Based on this and on the comments and examples presented in this revision, it is also possible to conclude that Brahms managed to create a sort of hybrid process, combining T T and DT. This c an be characterized when a basic intention for the transformation of a theme produces derived ideas that are able to progress as autonomous forms, eventually becoming referential forms for new derivations. This process, that can be epitomi zed by the case o f Op.8 (see", "Figure 11), will be analytically identified in this study with the label TDT (thematic - development transformation).", "3.2.3 Metric dissonance", "According to Frisch’s studies and analysis, this procedure corresponds to another power ful factor for de veloping variation. In fact, the manipulation of meter is one of the most personal characteristics of Brahms ’ music. Investigating the formation of Schoenberg’s earlier style, derived from a combination of Wagnerian and Brahmsian influence s, Frisch comment s on the so -called “Brahms fog”, a kind of atmosphere that has influenced a considerable part of Austro -German composers in the last years of the 19th century. Trying to precisely examine what constituted this source of influence, the auth or lists some typ ical aspects of Brahms’ modus operandi , among which is the preference for a rhythmic construction strongly based on hemiolas and hypermetrical configurations (See FRISCH, 1993, p.3 -19). According to Frisch, Schoenberg managed to assimilate this important p rocedure using it in a more natural and fluent manner (if compared to Zemlinsky (1871 -1942) and Reger (1873 -1916), both analyzed in the book), as demonstrated in his D major String Quartet , composed in 1897. Schoenberg himself recognizes Brahms’ mastery using metrical ambiguities for obtaining thematic variety. In his essay Brahms the Progressive (SCHOENBERG, 1984, p.398 -441) Schoenberg presents some examples of irregular and asymmetrical construction of phras es in the music of Mozart, Hay dn and Beethoven as precedents to Brahms ’ practice, associating them with his already mentioned concept of \"musical prose\". \"Asymmetry, combinations of phrases of different lengths, numbers of measures not divisible by eight, four or even two, i.e. imparit y of the number of measures, and other irregularities already appear in the earliest works of Brahms\" (Ibid., p.416). Schoenberg also dedicates some pages to the influence of the text on Brahmsian irregular phrasal preference, affirming that \"other asymmet rical structures (…) derive in part from the rhythmic peculiarities of the poems upon [the songs] which they are based\" (Ibid., p.418), presenting several musical examples. From Schoenberg ’s comments on this aspect, it is poss ible to infer that the extraor dinary naturality and fluency with which Brahms manipulates the articulation between durations and metrical configurations represent an important factor in explaining his unique thematic treatment. Developing variation depends not only on the production of derived ideas, but also on their proper interconnection. As it seems to have been intuited by Brahms, a", "continuous flux of elements which abrogates the notated metric and/or ignores the sectional boundaries – musical prose – may contribute to reinforce a developing -variation effect. Yuet Ng (2005) argues that \"metric dissonance\" is central to the understanding of Brahms’ style. It is presented by the author as a broad concept which encompasses categories like \"metric shift, me tric displacement, metric ambi guity, etc.\" (NG, 2005, p.5) . Ng uses Harald Kreb ’s definition for the concept, which is characterized by \"'non -alignment of layers of motion', where 'layer of motion' refers to 'a series of approximately equally spaced pulses '\" (KREBS apud NG, 2005, p.5). He also comments on Kreb’s dual classification of metric dissonance (Ibid., p.14 -17). The first classification considers the categories of grouping dissonance (which involves different cardinalities between layers) and displa cement dissonance. Although no t explicitly mentioned by him, the former encompasses the well - known hemiola, one of the most characteristic of Brahms’ s procedures. The second classification refers to the temporal dimension: the layers can be juxtaposed (ind irect dissonance)49 or superimp osed (direct).", "Back to hemiola, Ng (Ibid., p.23) brings a classification proposed by Channan Wilner, which subdivides this procedure into three types, according to the functions involved: (1) cadential (“which does not affect the prevailing metric (or hyp ermetric) structure”); (2) expansion (“which allows two measures on the surface to occupy the underlying time span of one measure”), and (3) contraction (“in which two measures are occupied by three harmonies that would ordina rily be spread out over the sp an of three measures at a slower harmonic rhythm”).", "After examining the analogies with its harmonic counterpart (Ibid., p.25 -30) and the relation between metric dissonance and form, drama and performance (p.30 -38), Ng presents his own theoretical proposal: the idea of a metric Grundgestalt . Using as precedent the studies of Patricia Carpenter on tonal and harmonic aspects of the Grundgestalt and their co-relations to intervallic -rhythmic structure, the author argues:", "While a p rominent motive on the surface (e.g., a third) may migrate to deeper levels of the tonal hierarchy (e.g., deep middle ground third -relations), surface metric dissonance may also be transformed into higher levels of metric conflicts – i.e., hypermetric dissonances – which translate the effect of the opening di ssonance into broader phenomena. (Ibid., p.40)", "Ng also suggests that Schoenberg’s musical prose could be seen as a case of subliminal metric dissonance, adding that “ an organic process in the pitch domain is seen [by", "49Ng (Id., p.19 -20) mentions that another of Kreb’s types, the subliminal dissonance, can be mixed up with the indirect case.", "Schoenberg] as the generator of metric dissonances, which are understood as something of a secondary attribute, a byproduct of a more fundamental process in the pitch domain ” (Ibid., p.41). Later (p.48) he exposes his hypoth esis: \"Brahms ’s use of metric dissonance paral lels Grundgestalt -like organic process in the pitch domain – i.e., an initial metric disturbance, analogous to the pitch motive, may develop into other metric ambiguities in the piece through stages of developi ng variation\".50 With similar purposes, Walter Frisch, in Brahms and the Principle of Developing Variation , highlights several occurrences of metric manipulation. For him, they can be considered as \"tools for developing variation, means for modifying and tr ansforming thematic -motivic material\" (FRISCH, 1984, p.93). In the trio Op.8 (see Ex.9, mm.10 -11) Brahms shifts the motive’s metrical position not only to create cadential momentum but also to review a new aspect of the theme, which has been hidden by the square 2+2 structure of early phrases – this is the descending three -note figure, F# -E-D#”", "A more sophisticated case of metric displacement can be observed in the Piano Quartet Op.26. Frisch (1984, p.76) comments that “listeners no dou bt hear a motivic relationship between [themes ] 1a and 1b, but no analysis has, to my knowledge, ever pinpointed Brahms’s remarkable motivic process, especially his subtle manipulation of duple and triple rhythms.” As it can be observed in Figure 13 (an adaptation of Frisch ’s ex.26), theme 1a initiate s with motive x, which is then rhythmically compacted and metrically dislocated, becoming the variant x' at the beginning of the theme 1b, followed immediately by another displacement.51", "Figure 13 : Brahms, Piano Quartet Op.26/I (mm.1 -9): metric displace ment of motive x (analysis by Walter Frisch). Adapted from FRISCH (1984, p.78) .", "50 We will return to Ng’ study in the derivative analysis of the sonatas. 51 For more instances of metric dissonance in Op.26 see Frisch (1984, p.79 -81).", "As mentioned before, the preference for hemiola is one of the most distinctive aspects of Brahms’ construction. A very interesting case in Frisch’s analyzes occurs precisely at the beginning of the first movement of the Violin Sonata Op.78, considered by the author as an innovative instance of “metrical development” with several implications along the movement.", "In the words of Frisch The violin part (…) reshapes the notated 6/4 meter into 3/2 (bar 11), then spills over the bar line in what we hear as an extra measure of 3/4 (…). This pattern begins again in the second half of bar 12, now completely overriding the notated bar lines. At bar 14, the theme settles into a “normal” 3/2 pattern. Underneath the irregularly expanding violin theme, the piano provides a continuous flow of eighth notes whose arpeggio patterns suggest yet another subdivision of the notated meter. The six notes within each slur are grouped by contour as 3+3; th e slurred groups themselves fall into a larger pattern of 3 (in bars 11 -13). The piano thus i mplies a broad meter of 18/8 (12/8+6/8), which becomes reduced to 12/8 when the violin settles into a steady 3/2 pattern at bar 14. This poly metrical relationship between the instruments, one of the most complex in all of Brahms, is further complicated by actual grouping of pitches in the piano – regardless, that is, of their registral placement and contour. In bar 11, for example, the first group in the right hand comprises F# -B-F#-B-F#-B. This arrangement suggests a2+2+2 division of the eighth notes withi n the slur, and thus projects something of the notated 6/4 meter. (Ibid, p.118)", "In order to highlight his analytical comments and make explicit the polymetrical configuration, Frisch rebars the passage. Figure 14a reproduces his ex.33, comparing it with the original version ( Figure 14b).", "Besides this interesting case, several others are present ed in the book involving a wide spectrum of Brahms’ works and different metrical procedures. Analyzing Op.34, Frisch (Id., p.95) considers that its “real achievement in the quintet (…) is to combine (…) fluency to a still freer metrical process”. He names this kind of fluency “metric fluctuation”. Another related concept – “metrical conflict” – is elaborated for describing som e intricate passages in the String Quartet Op.51/1 (Ibid, p.115). There is also the employment of structural metric dissonance in Brahms’ symphonies. In the second of them, Frisch (Id., p.123) considers th at “the metrical framework evades the authority of the bar line”. Moreover, “m etrical development plays a large role in the third symphony especially in the first two movements” (Ibid., p.133), the result being the effect of a metric fluctuation.", "For Fris ch, similarly as occurred in motivic -thematic treat ment, Brahms’ metric construction became more and more sophisticated and structurally integrated to the whole piece in his last phase. Taking again as a representative work on this period the song O Tod , Frisch (Id., p.153) argues that “ as in several of Br ahms’s large instrumental works, meter", "becomes in this brief song a powerful tool of developing variation. (…) the individual phrases of the song constantly vary in length (…) [resulting in a] fluid metric al structure generated by the asymmetry.”", "Figure 14 : Brahms, Violin Sonata Op.78/I (mm.11 -15): (a) metric conflict between piano and violin (rewritten by Walter Frisch).

According to Ng’ studies, this technique was probably inher ited from Mozart, Haydn , and Beethoven, and is used with distinct proposals, depending on the effect desired by the composer. ▪ The use of metric dissonance in Brahms’ music presented distinct aspects along his career, gradually deepening in the structure a nd spreading its influence in the piece beco ming what Frisch names as a “metrical development”.52 Being associated with Schoenberg ’s notion of \"musical prose\", linkage is an effective technique among those employed by Brahms for concatenating musical ideas through derivative processes. The following subsections present some definitions and an original proposal for its typology.", "3.2.4.1 Definitions", "The first elaboratio n of the concept of linkage (originally in German, Knüpftechnik ) is due to Heinrich Schenker (1868 -1935), as one of the vast repertoire of elements of his analytical theory and method. It can be defined as a \"technique of motivic association in which a new phrase repeats the motivic idea of the precedent phrase, aiming both to pr ovide continuity and to initiate something anew\" (FRAGA, 2011, p.76).54 Linkage is a relatively less -known resource of Schenkerian analysis (if compared to other ones, like unfolding , register transfers , progressions , initial ascents , and so on), being simp ly omitted in some referential texts on the subject.55 This fact seems to corroborate the general critic associated with the Schenkerian analysis, namely, that it gives less importance to motivic relations in the reduction process. However, as it can be dem onstrated in texts written by some of the first follo wers of Schenker ’s thought (for instance, Oswald Jonas56 and Sylvan Kalib57), the motive was not completely absent from his concerns.58", "52 Metric and hypermetric considerations are also part of the next topic, the linkage te chnique. 53 Part of the content of this section was published in MAYR & ALMADA (2016a).", "54 \"Técnica de associaç ão motívica em que uma nova frase repete a ideia motívica da frase anterior, tanto para dar continuidade a esta, quanto para iniciar algo novo. \" (translated from the original in Portuguese). 55 For example, FORTE & GILBERT (1982), PANKUHRST (2008) .", "56Jonas ( 1997 -1978) was Schenker’s pupil.

As a complementary definition, l inkage occurs when “a ‘ new’ idea evolves spontaneously from a preceding one” (FRISCH, 1984, p.15 -16), which can be associated with the concept of gradual development . Considered by Frisch and Smith as a distinctly Brahmsian constructive procedure, the employment of linkage for generating new themes from preceding motives can be viewed as one of the mo st efficient manners to provide a continuous and organic growth in a musical piece. Fig ure 15 presents a graphical representation of the use of linkage: the motivic element X that ends the musical idea a serves as basis for the beginning of the musical ide a b. In general, the element X’ suffers some kind of transformation, for example, melodic variation or metrical displacement. Anyhow, the new context provides sufficient contrast for both ideas, while th e strong similarity between X and X’ creates a unity of its own and grants continuity to the musical flux.59", "Figure 15 : Graphical representation of linkage in the connection of two musical ideas.", "Three analytical works were taken as main references fo r the present approach, according to its main objective, namely, to evidence the correlations between the technique of linkage and developing variation: (1) the influential book Brahms and the Principl e of Developing Variation (published in 1984), by Walte r Frisch; (2) Peter Smith ’s article New Perspectives on Brahms ’ Linkage Technique (2007); and (3) a newly issued academic dissertation (2015), entitled Knüpftechnik : Coding Narrative in the Music of Br ahms and the Experimental Fiction of Robbe -Grillet , wri tten by Steven Rahn.

We are grateful to Dr. Liduino Pitombeira for this information.", "approaching the same concept, each one of these studies addresses specific and particular aspects of the subject, being in a sense mutually complementary.", "Frisch ’s book departs from Schoenberg ’s comments in the previ ously mentioned essay Brahms the Progressive . His study aims to produce a systematical and deep analytical investigation into the Brahmsian organic procedures employed in the derivation of themes, considering his different compositional phases. The further -reaching results of the Frisch ’s analyzes is doubtless the precise identification of these procedures, among which the technique of linkage is certainly the most important. In his first comments about this topic, Frisch points out a type of implicit recog nition of linkage as a typical Brahmsian procedure in two writings by Schoenberg (FRISCH, 1984, p.15 -16). In spite of not formally identifying it as a technique, Schoenberg perceives the use of linkage in an analysis of Brahms ’ String Quartet Op.51, no. 2 (included in the essay Brahms the Progressive ), in which he detects the presence of a \"linking motive\". More meaningfully, in the book Fundamentals of Musical Composition (SCHOENBERG, 1990), Schoenberg exemplifies the composition of a musical sentence in t he style of Brahms, in which a linkage idea is clearly present connecting two subsections.60 Both instances (especially the latter) suggest that Schoenberg (even if in an intuitive manner) recognized linkage not only as a personal trait of Brahmsian style b ut also as a decisive constructive technique for thematic development. It is noteworthy to add that Schoenberg employed linkage to his own music (two examples of its application will be presented later).", "Figure 16 : Brahms: Piano Sonata Op.5/I – mm.5 -7, reduction (adapted from FRISCH, 1984, p. 171).", "In his text, Frisch analyzes various passage s from Brahms ’ works, distributed along his creative trajectory. In an early work, the Piano Sonata Op.5/I (composed in 1853, when Brahms was only 20 years old), the re is what the author considers \"an impressive precociously instance of the linkage techniq ue\" (FRISCH, 1984, p.37). Figure 15 shows an adapted and simplified version of Frisch ’s example, highlighting only the application of the", "60 This passage can be found in SCHOENBERG (1990, p. 65-66).", "technique. The movement ’s opening theme is organized as a small ternary form (using Schoenbergian terminology) being d ivided, according to Frisch ’s analysis, into three complementary ideas: Themes 1a, 1b and 1a'. As it can be observed in Figure 16, Theme 1b initiates with a variatio n (X') of the fragment that concludes the section a (X), in a new harmonic context.", "Within his book, Frisch points towards several other applications of linkage which present an increasingly more sophisticated treatment. Essentially, the use of the techniq ue by Brahms in the connection of ideas became more subtle and fluid avoiding explic it compartmentation, as in the case of Op.5. As an example of this mature practice, Frisch mentions the creation of a new theme through \"one of his most inspired uses o f the linkage technique\" (Ibid., p.140), in the recapitulation section of the second mov ement of the Second Symphony Op.73. As shown in Figure 17 (an adaptation from Frisch ’s Ex.40), the conclusive horns ’ figure (X) is immediately \"recycled\" by the violins (X' ), initiating the theme.", "Figure 17: Brahms: Third Symphony Op.90/II – mm.5 -7, reduction (adapted from FRISCH, 1984, p.140).", "Interestingly, this new theme replaces the original secondary theme (introduced in the exposition). After the presentation of the new idea, \"the two -note motive of the original second theme is heard, m uch as it was in exposition\" (…) and \"the 'missing' theme resurfaces three times in the last movement.\" This fact suggests a deeper, structural use of linkage, which becomes part of th e basic compositional planning. As Frisch affirms, besides \"an elegant method of generating new ideas\", in Op.73 linkage \"is put into the service of the larger design (…), for it replaces an earlier theme and thus sets in motion a drama that is resolved on ly in the finale\" (Ibid., p.140).", "Peter Smith proposes a refinement of F risch ’s study about linkage. With the aid of analytical tools adapted from Schenkerian analysis, Smith examines different instances of", "linkage in a varied group of Brahms ’ pieces (and in two cases of Beethoven compositions, as well). However, his main cont ribution to the subject is certainly the conceptual expansion of the linkage ’s scope, by considering three domains of application: melody, harmony and rhythm/meter. While the first one may be associated with the \"conventional\" linkage (i.e., oriented by a motivic -thematic derivation, as in Frisch ’s examples), the other two aspects demand further explanation. Introducing his point of view, Smith affirms that What has not been well recogn ized . . . is the extent to which rhythmic or harmonic components may en hance the associative effect of linkage, even as these components also manifest their own forms of structural reinterpretation. In the rhythmic dimension, this enhancement may involve either a change in the hypermetric position of a linking motive or the m igration of that motive in relation to the notated meter. In the harmonic dimension, the magical effect61 of association might engage continuity of a vertical sonority even as the verti cality involved undergoes a shift in structural meaning. Such harmonic l inkage may even arise between a structural harmony and an incidental or “apparent” version of the same", "From Smith ’s words , one can deduce that struc tural reinterpretation is a common attribute of the three kinds of linka ge and that its main consequence is to provide continuity in an economic way. The differences between the harmonic and rhythmic cases are properly elicited through the manner in which they are accomplished.", "Essentially, harmonic linkage occurs when a forma l boundary is \"blurred\" in some way, be it due to an unexpected connection or even to the omission of a chord. A recurrent instance of this case, among Smith ’s musical examples, involv es the cadential formula \"I 6/4- V5/3-I\" positioned at the boundary of som e important formal section (as the recapitulation of sonata forms). A harmonic linkage is properly established when the cadential I 6/4 chord is not followed by the expected V 5/3. Its o mission from the formula weakens the tonic arrival and the sense of change, contributing to a fluent continuity. Figure 18 (an adaptation of Smith’s example 6) illustrates the use of harmonic linkage in Beethoven’s Piano Sonata Op.90. As it can be observed in the passage that antecedes the recapitulation of the ma in theme (m.138 - 143), the resolution of the cadential I 6/4 (i.e., the expected V 5/3) is elided in some way harmonically fusing both sections. This contributes to the fluency of the musical narrativ e, being therefore perfectly adjusted to the idea of linkag e according to Smith ’s conception.62", "61\"Magical effect\" is a reference to a n expression used by Schenker to define linkage in his book on h armony, published i n 1906.", "62Even though this can undoubtedly be considered an example of harmonic linkage, one cannot disregard other elements that contribute to the intended compositional effect, as complementary factors: the almost obsessive repetition o f the melodic motive G -F#-E (X) and the constant metrical displacements of its several imitations. This discussion wi ll be returned to later, in the classification of types of linkage.", "Figure 18: Beethoven – Piano Sonata Op.90 / I / mm.138 -145, reduction, (adapted from SMITH, 2007, p.118).", "For Smith, rhythmic linkage involves necessarily \"me tric reinterpretation\" of motives, providing \"continuity an d contrast\" (Ibid., p.114). On a higher level, this is considered also under hypermetrical organization. This aspect is perfectly represented in the finale of Brahms ’ Piano Quartet in G minor. As p ointed by Smith, in this movement Brahms manipulates in several manners the metrical structure of a dyad F# -G. Thus, the composer \"develops the motive potentials for either strong -weak or weak -strong placement on multiple rhythmic levels\" (Ibid., p.140). I n other words, by exploring both local an d global (hypermetrical) possibilities for organization, Brahms obtains continuous structural reinterpretation for a single unity, which contributes to a notable economic construction. In an analysis which encompass es a considerable portion of his paper (I bid., p.39 -150), Smith demonstrates the extraordinary potential of the metric linkage for structuring a whole movement.", "Steven Rahn investigates an attractive and original perspective on linkage, addressing the corr elations between musical and literary nar ratives. The study takes as point of departure the famous passage from Marcel Proust ’s Du Côté de Chez Swann (first book of La Recherche du Temps Perdu ), in which some of the narrator ’s childhood memories are unexpe ctedly recovered by the taste of a madele ine cake accompanied by a cup of tea. Rahn (2015, p.3) claims that a similar sense of associative relation may occur in music, \"by recognizing and focusing on what is familiar: a melodic gesture, a rhythmic motive, a vertical sonority, the form, the genre, or any other characteristic.\" The dissertation examines the techniques employed by the French writer Alain Robbe -Grillet in selected passages from the novel Le Voyeur (published in 1955) and compares them with some linkage occurrences in two of Brahms ’ works: the song Liebesglut , Op. 47, No. 2 and the Piano Quartet No. 2 in A Major, Op. 26, I, in the search of \" instances in which association and linkage blur formal boundaries, thus creating a continuous stream of mu sical events\" (Ibid., p.5).", "In his first chapter, Rahn examines the origins of the concept, taking as reference studies on Schenkerian analysis. In a passage from a book written by Oswald Jonas linkage is firmly associated with the concept of musical cohes ion, which must be attained through varie d repetition. Sylvan Kalib defines linkage as a \"technique related to the connection of ensuing spans . . . it concerns the connection or linkage of phrases and/or sections.” (KALIB apud RAHN, 2015, p.6). After addi ng comments about Smith ’s study, Rahn pre sents some reflections about linkage, by arguing that ; temporal sequence increases in complexity and new meaning may emerge when the ending of a musical phrase simultaneously functions as the beginning of the subseq uent phrase. A facet to linkage that has yet to be explored, in conjunction with narrative, is t he manner in which the technique can produce confusion and disorientation and the expressive implications therein. While composers often use linkage to achieve formal cohesiveness, the technique can also cause temporal disruption (Ibid., p.10).", "Therefore , Rahn proposes another functionality for linkage, besides to achieve cohesiveness by continuity, which is caused by temporal disruption . Aiming to deepen and t o support this original point of view, the second chapter of the dissertation addresses the use of linkage as a powerful narrative device in the Robbe -Grillet ’s novel. Musical application of the results obtained from the literary analysis is the focus of c hapter three, with the exam of two of Brahms ’ pieces. Rahn initiates the discussion wit h the argument that, while Smith is only concerned with instrumental music, his approach aims to demonstrate that linkage is also subordinate to poetic expression especi ally in Brahms ’ songs (Ibid., p.53). Considering the specific case of Liebesg lut he aff irms:", "While my reading of the musical narrative partially derives from Brahms’s treatment of hypermeter throughout the work, the interaction of linkage with the harmonic fabric also plays a significant role. By engaging with the text’s themes, I argue that the song’s second half progresses through a tragically ironic denouement and rejects the earlier expressive implications defined by the moments of linkage. Rather than resolution, defeat and resignation characterize the conclusion of the work.", "In his lo ng analyzes (20 pages), Rahn presents three instances of linkage, each one oriented by a musical parameter: hypermetric organization, harmony , and melody (personified by a motive). According to the author, all of the three moments are put into the service of elements present in the poem ’s plot (and associated with literary strategies evidenced in his second chapter), thus musically illustrating concepts like disruption, e vasion , and confusion. Considering what was discussed in this bibliographical revision it is possible to enlist the followings conclusions:", "(a) linkage is an efficient technique intended to promote developing variation;", "(b) its employment by Brahms is a characteri stic trait of his thematic construction modus operandi , present in most of his composit ional career; (c) it can operate on different structural levels and consider three domains: melody, harmony and rhythm/metric; (d) melodic linkage, which is the most salient typ e and of easiest understanding, occurs when a variation of the conclusive motivic fragm ent of a musical idea is employed for initiating the subsequent thematic idea; (e) harmonic and rhythmic linkage involve more vague and abstract associative relations (and, consequently, relatively harder to detect in analysis), resulting in structural reinter pretation, due to the \"blurring\" of formal boundaries. This can be caused by frustrating harmonic expectancies (omission of chords, use of inversions, etc.) or displacem ent and/or manipulation of metrical or hypermetrical structures; (f) linkage may also be employed for highlighting expressive connotations with narrative plots, as in songs; (g) the main specific purposes of linkage use for organic construction can be summarized as: to achieve cohesiveness by continuity (Jonas), to generate new thematic ideas (Frisch), to \"provide continuity [and contrast] in an economic way\" (Smith), to be employed as structuring means in a larger -scale (Frisch and Smith), \"to produce confusion an d disorientation and the expressive implications therein\" (Rahn).", "Based on these poi nts, the next subsection presents an original proposal of a typology for linkage, aiming at contributing for the systematization and refinement of this subject.", "3.2.4.2 Linkage t ypology", "An ideal typology would be able to precisely describe a given occurrence of linkage considering three aspects: (1) domain (melodic, harmonic or rhythmic/metric); (2) level (formal position) and (3) finality (one of those enlisted above, in letter \" g\"). Since the latter aspect cannot always be easily determined (especially consideri ng a local -level analysis), it seems reasonable (at least, in this moment of the research) to propose a simpler version for the typology encompassing just the first two as pects.

It can be external (level 1), when it occurs in a boundary between two sections (and different thema tic ideas, in the case of melodic linkage) or interna l (level 2), when it is positioned inside a given section, almost always connecting phrases or segments of a theme. While level 1 corresponds to the general case (represented by the scheme of Fig ure 3), level 2 is considerabl y rarer. Figures 19 and 20 present two instances of internal linkage, extracted from two distinct pieces of Schoenberg.

A further refinement of the cases of level 1 can be now proposed, aiming to express the “deepness” grade of the separation of the involved sections. In other words, for a more complete functional understanding of linkage in this aspect it seems necessary to know if the boundary in question corresponds to a relatively more or less important event, formally speaking. Taking into account the comprehensible difficulty for establishing a precise distinction of all of the possible situations in such fluid and al most intangible issue, only two alternatives will be considered: global -level boundaries (for instance, between development and recapitulation sections in a sonata form movement), which will be labeled with the letter \"a\" and local -level boundaries (betwee n subsections, as parts of a small ternary form, for example), cases classified with the letter \"b\".", "According to the present typology, a generic case of linkage must be identified through a simple formula (d -l), when \"d\" expresses the considered domain ( m, h or r in simple cases or a combination of them in hybrid situations) and \"l\" the level of application (\"2\", for internal linkage, \"1a\", for global -external and \"1b\", for local -external).

In his book The Origin of Species (2010/1872), a special chapter is dedicated to the speculations about the existence of what Darwin named \"laws of variation\" (p.103 -124). According to his reflec tions on this subject, the di vergences between live beings could only be explained by a very slow process of cumulative variation in different part s of their organisms. One of his most important conclusions was that this kind of progressive transformation was ultimately responsible fo r the formation of new species, genres, families, etc., with the magnitude of changes in a direct proportional relation to the necessary time span for their occurrence. In spite of the fact that in his epoch Earth’s age was dated in hundreds of thousands o f years, Darwin intuited that only a much bigger scale of time could adequately support his theory (this would be proved later, many decades after Darwin ’s death.).", "Figure 21 : Chart of biological variation (DARWIN, 2010/1872 , p.17)", "Figure 21 presents an interesting scheme drawn by Darwin himself and published in his book. It describes a segment of the hypothetical evolutionary history of a group of eleven individuals of distinct spec ies (A -L, at the bottom of Figure 21) alon g fourteen generations. The dashed lines represent their respective variants (some of the forms are more prolific, others – like G – are entirely sterile). In this scheme, Darwin aimed to demonstrate that the extent of divergences between exemplars of same species c an increase with", "unpredictable velocities and directions across time (see the descendants from A, for example), in such a manner that new species (indicated at the upmost line of the figure) can arise in a relatively few number of generations (it is intere sting to compare Darwin ’s scheme with the model for the binomial Grundgestalt /develop ing variation, proposed in Fig ure 7). For Darwin, variation was mainly caused by pressures resulting from sexual and natural selection as well from special condi tions of t he environment. Only in the 20th century, with the revolutionary discovery of the DNA structure and its multiple implications, it was established that biological variation is actually caused by a myriad of complex intracellular processes, involvi ng microsc opic structures and/or chemical reactions and substances, provoked by genetic mutations. A mutation occurs randomly in a given living form affecting one of its genes, which in most cases results in no evolutionary advantage (if it is not a disadv antage for its life). Just an extremely low parcel of mutations contributes to give some advantage for a being in relation to its closer circle of competitors, increasing its chance to obtain more food and/or to breed and, consequently, to transmit its adv antageous genetic variation to its descendants. These successful creatures are then selected (in the Darwinian sense) and tend to prosper among its rivals (that , in turn , tend to disappear if they continue to share the same geographic ambient). According t o what is known in the modern field of evolutionary biology,63 the cumulative micro -mutations, during almost unimaginable long geological eras, explains the enormous diversity of species of animals and plants which exist (and existed) in our planet.", "Back to the realm of music, from an abstract perspective, it is easy to perceive striking similarities between developing variation and the transmission of genetic mutational transformations. Both are organic processes that are performed (and analytically observe d) accordi ng to time, promote considerable changes through addition of (in most cases) very small steps of transformation, are transmitted to the next generations of variants (which became referential forms for further derivation), and develop according to some \"dir ection\" (which results from selective pressures in biology, and from compositional intentions in music). In sum, it is possible to define both processes as \"variation in time\", whose performance will be regulated by a dynamic balance between chan ge and mai ntenance of", "63In respect to this subject, see for example DAWKINS (2006). It is als o interesting to connect what we could name \"musical evolution\" to the so called theory of memes , created by Dawkins a s a modern branch of Darwin’s evolution. The memes are the cultural correspondents to the biological genes. They essentially consist of transmitted information along \"generations\". Memes can be, among other categories, concepts, messages, gossips, prayers, images, and, of course, also music. We are grateful to Dr. Gentil -Nunes for this perspective.", "components.64 In this way, the \"velocity\" of transformation measured in a given time span will be directly proportional to the amount of transformation due in detriment to the elements preserved during the process (conversely, the more character istics are maintained, the lower will be the \"velocity\" of variation).", "Another aspect refers to the range of the application of the derivative processes. It can be: (a) local, when it is considered only a given referential form and its immediate offspring , or (b) global, when it is considered the complete derivative trajectory of the form (or its lineage, in genealogical terms).", "Figure 22: Model of a developing variation process from a referential form, considering the interaction of AGI, TH, and RV.

Three A GIs can be identified in the process (indicated on the model by north -south, vertical arrows): (1) the longest one, conn ecting the replication of the feature a along the 3 generations; (2) connecting the feature b, which \"survives\" only in the first generation, disappearing from the \"genetic pool\"; (3) connecting the new feature d, introduced in the first -generation variant, to its transformed descendants d'. This case corresponds to an instance of TH (graphically represented in the model by inclined arrows). Features e, f, and g have no implications, thus are associated with the residual variance (RV) in the process. It is n oteworthy to observe that d, which is considered a RV in the first generation changes his status in the following one, being transmitted as d' (it not occurs with its \"brother\" c, which is eliminated from the process). It allows us to conclude that the fun ctions of the elements that form a DV process can only be precisely determined retroactively after its completion.", "3.2.6 Concluding remarks", "The theoretic aspects discussed in this chapter allow us to highlight some basic points:", "a) The principles of Grundges talt and developing variation, associated with an organicist conception of musical creation, correspond to a powerful constructive and structuring force in the Austro -German music of the 19th and early 20th centuries, being especially represented in Brahms ’ and Schoenberg’s works; b) The Grundgestalt can be considered both as an abstract entity (co nnected to the Idea, according to the Schoenbergian conception) and a concrete structure. The latter is normally manifested at the beginning of a piece as a group o f musical elements, most commonly, intervals and rhythms, but also harmony, tonal relations (as stated by Carpenter), metrical configurations (according to Ng’ recent studies), etc.;", "c) Developing variation consists of a group of techniques and procedures emp loyed for gradually transforming musical ideas, which become part of derivative lineages tha t can ultimately be traced back to the basic elements present in the Grundgestalt . Among these techniques, linkage, metric manipulation , and thematic transformation /development can be considered the most efficient, and characteristic of Brahms’ composition al modus operandi ; d) The economic and organic process triggered by the application of both principles in a composition can be compared to biological growth and evolu tionary development.", "The conjunction of these elements becomes the basis for the analytical model that is used in this study.

This structural investigation represents , therefore , an important stage, s ince it provides, not only the proper identification of thematic ideas and their multiple derivations , but also their corresponding formal functions and \"geographic\" position in the structure, the harmonic context, and, last but not the least, the conceptu al- terminological corpus adopted in this study. This methodological strategy is supported by the view of Julian Horton about the understanding of Brahms ’ (and by extension, we think , also Miguéz ’s) music. For him, nineteenth -century forms cannot be conside red as \"types susceptible to independent consideration, but rather as a high -level grouping structures, the nature of which is conditioned by the interaction of syntax, motivic proc esses and tonal relations.\" (HORTON, 2017, p.71). We agree with this vision , adding that only a deep examination of the integrated and inter -dependent elements of form, thematic construction, and tonal relations, hierarchically organized in a multi -level s tructure, can provide the adequate basis for a systematical analysis of use of developing variation, the very goal of this research, to be accomplished in chapters 6 and 7.", "4.2 Theoretical grounds", "The structural analysis is based on three of the most recent, worldwide recognized and powerful theories related to the aspects of fo rm, thematic structure and tonal relations (HEPOKOSKI and DARCY, 2006; CAPLIN, 1998; KOPP, 2002 ).65 They are combined to support the application of an original (recently improved) methodology, named formal - harmonic layered analysis (FHL).66", "65It is important to mention four other authors also considered as bibliographical support for this study , taking into account questions about contextual, stylistic, and processual aspects found in the analysis: Janet Schmalfeldt (2011), Peter Smith (1992, 2007), Richard C ohn (2012), and Julian Horton (2017 ). 66The section 3.3 summarizes their main principles", "4.2.1 Sonata The ory", "Intended to present an exhausting and deep panel of “sonata form”, the highly influential Elements of Sonata Theory (HEPOKOSKI& DARCY, 2006) b ecame a n important reference for musicological, theoretical , and analytical studi es. In spite of addressing especially the music of the late 18th century, one of its most attractive perspectives is a detailed examination of the multiple deviations from the norm (or, as the author ’s name, “deformations”) that started to proliferate from the decades that anteceded t he Romantic period. Each chapter of this book is systematically dedicated to one of the sonata’s structural aspect: the primary and secondary groups, the transition, the closing section, and so forth. Besides including a new terminology, whose main virtues are precision, originality , and efficiency, Hepokoski and Darcy’s study impresses by the great variety of situations labeled and systematically cataloged and exemplified , especially addressing the music of Haydn, Mozart , and Beethoven. Romantic composers are not left out, with examples from Schubert, Schumann , and all the way up to Tchaikovsky and Nielsen. In the case of Brahms, several parts of the book highlight specific compositional procedures, some of them supporting the present analysis.", "Perhaps the most important concept of this theory is the idea of rotations and the rhetoric presentation of functional modules .67 It is als o a crucial issue in their theory the role played by the cadences in the proper articulation of the sections in a sonata consider ing several levels of organization. Three cadential alternatives are taken into consideration with this function, in decreasing order of importance:", "1. Perfect Authentic Cadence (PAC) – is the strongest available structural punctuation, occurring when both h armony and melody reach the stable tonic; 2. Half Cadence (HC) – the resolution point is the dominant. I t always implies a continu ation; 3. Imperfect Authentic Cadence (IAC) – it is considerably less stable than PAC, being rarely used for formal segmentation (at least in the most hierarchical structuring levels). According to the authors, a n IAC is characterized when a harmonic tonic", "67The concepts of rhetoric and rotation are respect ively defined by HEPOKOSKI and DARCY (2006, p. 16) as it follows: \"The exposition’s rhetorical task, no less important , is to provide a referential arrangement or layout of specialized themes and textures against which the events of the two subsequent space s - development and recapitulation - are to be measured and understood […] Sonata -form structures are centra lly concerned with the formal principle that we call rotational form or the rotational process: two or more (varied) cyclings - rotations - through a modular pattern or succession laid down at the outset of the structure.\"", "conclusion supports a melodic end in the third (or, more rarely, on the fifth) of the I chord.", "The Sonata Theory refines the well -known argument presented by Charles Rosen in his Sonata Forms (1998), namely that there is not “the” sonata form, but a multit ude of possible configurations. Hepokoski and Darcy specifically enumerate five types of sonata: (1) without development section (classified by Rosen as “sonatina form”); (2) in which the return of the primary group is omitted (or , in the authors’ terminology , with the third rotation beginning inside the Development); (3) the “conventional” sonata (the most common type);68 (4) the Ro ndo-Sonata; and (5) the particular sonata structure present in concertos. As stated above, the Sonata Theory is formed by a large group of n ew and precise pragmatic concepts with their respective terminological labels. The most important of these ideas fo r the present analysis are described as follows:69 • Primary thematic group (P) – presents the initial (a nd main) theme of the work. When P is subdivided into some ideas, there are two possibilities: if the segments are separated by PACs, they are conventiona lly labeled as P1, P2, P3,…; otherwise , they are numbered as P1.1, P1.2, P1.3, etc. (the same conventi ons are applied to the other two thematic areas, S and • Transition (TR) – its main function is to connect P and S (secon dary group), always finishing with a clear and strong cadential punctuation (mostly HC in the dominant region, or major relative in minor -mode sonatas).", "• Medial Caesura (MC) – represents precisely the separation between this important cadence and the secondary group. Characteristically , this boundary is reinforced by the use of a general rest or a melodic fill.", "• Secondary thematic group (S) – presents t he thematic contrasting idea . Normally, it is compo sed by a group of modules, the first one being the most important (mostly lyrical in character and in a new texture).", "• Essential Expository Cadence (EEC) – is the very goal of the exposition being the most stable point (although in the dominant region) up to this moment, corresponding to a strong PAC.", "68 Both sonatas analyz ed in this s tudy are structured as type 3. 69 For the sake of simplicity and focus, only the most characteristic (or of \"first -default\", as stated by the authors ) manifestations of these elements were selected in this summary.", "• Concluding module (C) – following the E EC, it is formed by one or more brief themes with the specific purpose of confirming the closure of the expository section. • Pre-Core / Core / Retransition70 – is the basic segmentation adopted for the Developmental section that in turn can be subdivided in different ways . As Hepokoski and Darcy argue , the development of a sonata is all but randomly or arbitrarily structured, being normally organized according to the same rotational principle th at orient s the construction of Exposition and R ecapitulation.", "• Essential Sonata Cadence (ESC) – is the corresponding cadential point in the Recapitulation Section to the EEC, being even more stable since its PAC occurs in the tonic region.", "Figure 23 summarizes th e interaction of these concepts in a sonata of type 3.", "Figure 23 : Basic elements of the Sonata Theory considering type 3 (adapted from HEPOKOSK I and DARCY,", "4.2.2 Theory of Formal Functions", "As an assumed follower of Schoenberg’s theory about form and motivic -thematic construction, William Capli n published in 1998 a seminal work about this subject .

Moreo ver, the innumerou s cases that do not conform to either are classified into different types of hybrids and compounds, clearly delimitated.", "Two issues are of paramount importance for Caplin ’s theory: the concepts of grouping structure and formal functions . In a musical work Each group – a self -contained \"chunk\" of music (…) – can be identified mo st neutrally in terms of its measure length. Thus, we speak of a two-measure idea grouping with another two -measure idea to form a four -measure phrase, wh ich in turn may group with another phrase of the same length to form a n eight -measure theme, and so on (grouping structures are not always so symmetrical, of course).", "In regard to the second aspect, Caplin defines some essential formal functions (“the more defined role that the group plays in the formal organization of the work”): presentation , contrast , prolongation , continuation , and cadential . He also identifies form al processes (repetition, fragmentation, extension, expansion, liquidation , and so forth) and formal types (sentence, period, small ternary, small binary, sonata , etc. ). Like Hepokoski and Darcy, Caplin attributes enormous importance to the cadence as a powerful means of formal articulation (he adopts the same terminology). In fact, the presence or absence of the cadential types can be considered a decisive factor for distinguishing the basic forma l types.", "According to him, there are some building blocks (in a pattern -form with a two - bar extension) from which more complex forms can be structured. They are: 1. Basic idea (b.i.) – the most important element of a theme, contai ning its essential motives;71 2. Contrasting idea (c.i.) – presents new, contrasting material, generally complementing the b.i.; 3. Response – it is configured as a varied repetition or (more commonly) a sequence of the initial idea; 4. Cadential segment – as the na me says , it is associated w ith the conclusion function, almost always finishing with a PAC.", "71 As a matter of fa ct, that is where the Grundgestalt is.", "Depending on the manner in which these blocks are combined (and on the presence of cadential articulation) one can obtain the structures of period , sentence or ev en hybrid and compound form s. Basically, the period differs from the sentence in the position of the similarity relation between idea s. In the latter, this occurs in the middle of the whole, i.e., in m.5 (assuming that the pattern -form of both structures h as eight bars), in general consisting of a literal repetition of the b.i. In the sentence, the similarity relation is immediately established in m.3, in this case , formatted as a response.", "Both, the period and the sentenc e are subdivided into two parts (m .1-4/m.5 -8), being respecti vely named as antecedent -consequent and presentation -continuation. Apart from the similarity/contrast distinctions , an important particularity differentiates period from sentence in this higher level: the presence of a cadence se parating the two halves in the case of the period.72 Figure 24 presents a schematic view of both forms.

Since its initial formulations by David Lewin (1982), which derived from a combination of Riemann’s Theory of Harmonic Functions and mathematical conce ptions associated with music (especially concerning the Group Theory) , the Transformational Theory has been constantly i mproved and expanded by some notable scholars, like Bryan Hyer, Richard Cohn, Robert Peck, Jack Douthett and Peter Steinbach, David Kopp , among others. Its basic principles are summarized by Cohn (1998, p.189): “triadic transformations; common -tone maximization; voice leading parsimony; ‘mirror’ or ‘dual inversion’; enharmonic equivalence; and the Table of Tonal Relations”. Although applie d to the exam of a very diversified repe rtoire (including post -tonal and popular music), the theory is notably suitable for the analytical investigation of certain constructive choices of Romantic composers, which according to traditional harmonic analysis , could only be explained as idiosyncras ies or mere extravagancies derived from the 19th century's Zeitge ist.", "Figure 28: Examples of cases from the literature , considering compound types of Figure 2 7 (CAPLIN,", "An interesting aspect of the transformational analysis is the possibi lity to address it into two levels of organization: low (for chordal progressions) and high (for the tonal relations). In the present study, we consider only the high-level trans formation s, aiming to evidence associations with formal events present in both sonatas . With this purpose, we adopt as main reference the Transformational Chromatic System , proposed by David Kopp in his book Chromatic Transformations in Nineteenth -Century Music (2002). As stated by Carlos Almada (2017, p.21) , an operation (as concei ved by Kopp) can be considered as a mathematical function that maps a given triad (or tonal region) onto another in such a manner that at least one of the original notes is maintained in the process. Figure 29 presents the transformation of triad C onto F, through the function/operation D (dominant).

The best manner to address the second aspect (involving the associations between the analyzes and the theory) is to select for a comparative discussion the two movements constructed with the same basic structure, namely the first of each sonata. Taking as main references the principles of Sonata Theory, as well as several other fonts (considering not only transformational relations, but also aesthetical, and contextual aspects that characterize the Roman tic practic e), these concluding remarks aim to highlight common procedures and differences between Brahms and Miguéz, specially under the light of Hepokoski and Darcy’s", "127 It is also possible to add another important point: the specific examination of Miguéz’s compositional procedures.

In the case of Miguéz, diatonic mediants C# minor and F# minor are pres ent in both, P and S sections. The flat major mediant (C) is employed as a third divisor between the tonic and the dominant i n the transition.

He manages th is especially with the employment of roving harmonies (mostly based on sequence of diminished chords and symmetrical configuration). Although, apparently simpl er, Brahms modulations seems to be more organically lead by the thematic elaboration (we will ret urn to this important point in the derivative analysis) . Curiously, the minor tonic is reached in both pieces at almost the end of the Core section. In the cas e of Brahms, however, this fact, as it was discussed, represents a decisive structural impact as it was seen. In respect to the Retransitions, the analyzes point two distinct strategies: one more conventional, with an explicit dominant preparation (Op.14), and the “deformed” solution found by Brahms to help hide the boundaries of the recapitulation.", "RECAPITULATION • Thematic Structure : Considering this issue, there are two interesting common points between both recapitulations: (a) the reduction of the P ar eas (with the suppression of P1.1’ in the case of Brahms; and a radical diminution of the thematic “territory” with Miguéz); (b) the unaltered re -exposition of S modules (disregarding the necessary transposition to tonic). Considering the Transition, while Brahms simply omits it completely, connecting the contrasting section of P1 directly to the secondary theme,129 Miguéz ingeniously re writes his in such a manner that it is presented as a variation of P2 whose cadential conclusion deceptively leads to a n unexpected flat major submediant (c.f. p.4 5). Finally, there is a distinction in respect to the treatment of the Coda: the elaborated c onclusion (in thematic and harmonic terms) in Brahms movement contrasts vividly with Miguéz’s very short and simple tonic pr olongation. As it was evidenced, both works reveal complex and notable organic constructions which involve a profound interaction of the elements mentioned above in different levels of organization. Although, in a broad perspective, conformed to the trad itional structure of a sonata, these movements have plenty of innovations (“deformations”) and surprises, some of them profound and structural, especially in the case of the Brahms’ s movement. Accordingly, Hepokoski and Darcy associate their concept of def ormation not", "129This fact is considered as a distinctive element of some Brahms sonata recapitulations by Peter Smith. Comment ing specifically the Op.78, Smith (1992, p.105) affirms that “Brahms transforms the entire first group recapitulation in a structural anacrusis to the second theme [S].\"", "only to the spirit of rebellion proper of the Romantic thinking, but also to more objective compositional solutions, as those found by Brahms and, although in a lesser extent, also by Miguéz. As the authors tell us the presence of any sonata deformation whose implications extend over the generic structure of the whole piece would seem ipso facto to call into question the legitimacy of the sonata strategy to provide a solution to the compositional or expressive problem at hand. This is especial ly true of those deformations that articulate a sonata that “fails” to accomplish its generic mission (sonatas with non - resolving re capitulations, minor -mode sonatas whose major -mode, emancipatory ESC’s are overturned in the coda, and the like). Extreme fo rmal deformation can suggest an undermining of confidence in the form itself. The demonstration of “sonata failure” became an increa singly attractive option in the hands of nineteenth - century composers who, for one reason or another, wished to suggest the inadequacy of the Enlightenment grounded solutions provided by generic sonata practice. Deformation of form became identical with de formation of expressive content. Such options could be employed in ei ther programmatic or “absolute” composition (HEPOKOSKI and DARCY, 2012, p.254) .", "We consider that the present analysis has contributed to explain most of these normative \"subversions\", from a large -scale bias through the methodology structures adopted, revealing extraordinary and peculiar compositional plans firmly associated with the Romantic practice. In support to this view, we can also quote the words of Julian Horton: The expansion or revision of classical thematic types and functions is a hallmark of early nineteenth -century style: thematic designs carri ed over from the late eighteenth -century is radically enlarged; themes retain the proportions of the classical foreb ears, often subjecting the marks of syntactic positioning to extensive revision; and a new emphasis on material processes produces transform ations of function at all formal levels. Attempts to deploy such habits in the context of sonata form alter the form al proportions, the articulation of its major original structural divisions, and the way in which formal function is projected .

MDA is essentially employed for examining derivative relations in organically -constructed musical pieces, especially those associated with thema tic construction and their provenience from the components of a Grundgestalt .", "MDA analysis of a given composition has to be preceded by a very important phase, namely the localization and delimitation of the piece’s Grundgestalt (in short, G). In this ear lier stage, the analyst must be profoundly familiar with the work in question, through many hearings of its recordings and a careful examination of the score. More precisely, he/she must pay special attention to the transformation of the musical materials along the piece and, gradually, be able to trace back their correlations to an eventual original source (which is invariably located at the initial bars of the piece). Just after doing this, and, evidently, if successful in the task, the analyst will be capable of properly identify the referential unity (G) from which presum ably most of the piece’s derivati ve relationships emanate, and further analytical interpretations will be produced (MAYR & ALMADA, 201 7a). The next section briefly presents the basis of MDA and several of its aspects along the way until the current version.", "5.2 Background", "The primordial assumption we adopt is that the derivative process could be analytically explained through two layers of operation: the abstract and the concrete levels. The former, timeless and hypothetically accessed only through the composer’s mind, corresponds to a so to speak one -dimensional variation, i.e., considering an isolated structural aspect of a musical idea (an intervallic or rhythmic configuration for examp le). Derivative processes that occur in the abstract level are classified as developing variation of first order (DV1). The concrete level is responsible for “conventional” variation, in other words, considering the idea as an inseparable musical unity. Th is case corresponds to developing variation of second order (DV2).", "The Grundgestalt is considered the starting point of the whole derivative process (be it DV1 or DV2). Normally, the Grundgestalt of a piece is hardly a monolithic block , rather it is form ed by a conjunction of some basic motivic elements. Since 2011 MDA has been applied i n analyzes of several organically -constructed pieces, which has contributed to provide new elements and concepts. The first analysis was made in Schoenberg’s Chamber Symph ony (ALMADA, 2011a). Figure 79 presents a brief sample of the graphic analysis employ ed at that time. As it can be observed, the rectangles identify the variations but not the complete information as we now have.", "Figure 79: Schoenberg Op.9 – Derivativ e analysis of the main theme (ALMADA , 2011a, p.83).", "The analysis that followed (of the themes of Berg’s Piano Sonata , Op.1) employed almost exactly the same methodological resources. Figure 80 shows the analytical explanation of the three components that form the Grundgestalt of the piece. The model would get closer to its present configuration in the following year in an article intended to describe it in more detail (ALMADA, 2012), a transitory period, as it is shown in Figure 81. As it can be easily pe rceived, it was not very concise at that stage.", "Figure 80: Berg Op.1 – Analysis of the Grundgestalt (ALMADA , 2011b, p.13).", "Figure 81: MDA basic overview (ALMADA , 2012, p.139).", "In 2013 the model was applied to another work by Berg, the first of the Four Songs Op.2.

In the initial part of the article , Carpenter selects some of Schoenberg’s writings about these theories, aiming to obtain support for her claims. Her point is specially to evidence the impor tance of the harmonic dimension (includi ng, of course, tonal relations) for the characterization of the musical idea (in Schoenberg’s conception). With this purpose, she highlights one of the composer’s most personal convictions, that “theme and harmonic progression are two sides of the same ide a; therefore the developing Grundgestalt is made manifest in its harmonic as well as its melodic function” ( Ibid. p.16). The change of functions of melodic notes according to harmonic and tonal contexts is an aspect especially focused by Carpenter, aiming to apply her developed formulations in an analytical example, in this case, the first movement of Beethoven’s Piano Sonata Op.57, nicknamed Appassionata . Carpenter’s analysis is especially centered in a descending minor second interval (A -G), present in t he main theme of the piece, that assumes a wide spectrum of tonal/harmonic functions along the movement, resulting in a remarkable expansion of the regional context.

Being his proposal essentially an examination in large -scale of musical events, Ng grounds his arguments on the hypothesis of existence of a Brahmsian metric al Grundgestalt on Carpenter ’s article (the same we used as main reference in the precedent section). In his words , While a prominent motive on the surface […] may migrate to deeper levels of the tonal hierarchy (e.g., deep middle ground third -relations), surface metric dissonance may also be transformed into higher levels of metric conflicts – i.e., hypermetric dissonances – which translate the effect of the opening dissonance into broader phenomena. (NG, 2005, p.40)", "In another passage he adds that Brahm s’s use of metric dissonance parallels Grundgestalt -like organic process in the pitch domain – i.e., an initial metric disturbance, analogous to the pitch motive, may develop into other metric ambiguities in the piece through stages of developing variation . (Ibid., p.48)", "Moreover, for Ng the presence of a metric Grundgestalt at the beginni ng of a musical work – which, basically, introduces a kind of \"problem\" to be solved – necessarily implies the existence (at any point in the middle of the piece) of a \"p eak\" of metrical dissonance and the posterior resolution of the conflict ( Ibid., p.61) . It is precisely what happens in the Horn Trio Op.40, whose metric structure is analyzed in one chapter of Ng ’s work (Ibid., p.203 -83). In this case, a metric dissonance takes place in the initial bars of the first movement, result ing from a divergence between violin and piano (see Figure 199, constructed with basis on Ng's analytical considerations). This dissonance represents, according Ng, the metric Grundgestalt of th e Trio, which is prolonged along the piece and resolved only in the last movement.", "In an analysis of a later work, the Rhapsody Op.119/4 (composed in Brahms’ last year of life, 1897), Ng identifies the metric Grundgestalt as an alternation binary/ternary that occurs in the first bars. As in Op.40, he maintains that this initia l metric disturbance is the \"point of departure, from which we arrive at the other levels of the system\" (ibid., p.315).

Analogously to what is done in ordinary derivative analysis, we can name these situations as variants (in this m anner, the case of Figure 193 can be considered as the first metrical variant of the movement).177 Other variants occur in the following passages: mm.29 -35 (Transition) , mm.94 -96, mm.111 -127 (climax Development), mm.148 -155 (Retransition), and mm.231 -241 (Co da).178 The metrical disturbances of the first movement are transmitted, though in different configurations, to the second. As previously discussed (see Figures 143 an d 145, pp.195 and 197 ), violin and piano parts in g 2 act almost as independent tectonic pl ates, considering both metrical and harmonic dimensions. Metrical conflicts also arise along the movement: mm. 9 -13 (contrasting b section, as an intensification of t he disturbance like what happened in the first movement), mm. 17 -23 (bridge for the second theme), mm. 49 -57, and Differently from the precedent movement, the third does not present explicit metrical dissonances (excluding the mentions to the A dagio’s theme, that brings the original conflicts in its appearances). Under the light of what happened in the two preceding movements this can be seen as surprising (and even inconsistent), however the discussion that will be presented in the next section maybe will provide a plausible explanation.", "6.9 The Case of Regenlied", "In 1873 (five ye ars before composing Op.78), Brahms wrote a cycle of eight songs, among which one entitled Regenlied (song of rain), based upon a poem by Klaus Groth. As shown in Fig ure 203, the seven initial bars are identical to the beginning of the third movement’s main theme (disregarding the double meter and the key in which it was written: F# minor).", "177For simplicity, we decided to limit the metrical analysis of fourth level to the identification of the initial dissonance (the metrical Grundgestalt ) and of its subsequent manifestations (\"variations\") along the movements, omitting a detail ed analysis of these. 178The reca pitulations that maintain the same metrical context were omitted from this list.", "Figure 203: Brahms – Regenlied Op.59/3, first stanza (mm.1 -22).", "Apart from the interesting fact that the song inspired the sonata’s theme, the displacement of the source of material for the derivative process from the first to the third movement brings , at least in a first thought, a serious problem for the structure of the analytical methodolo gy here adopted. Accordingly, the whole derivative analysis applied in this chapter was firmly based on the detection of the Grundgestalt of Op.78 (and its five components) in the initial bars of the first movement. Therefore, would it be a correct decisio n simply to \"ignore\" this historical issue and proceed as we did, considering as seed something that was actually an elaboration? Could the proper structure of the method ultimately be questioned ? Trying to justify our analytical choices we present two arg uments: (1) the derivative analysis does not aim primarily at a reliable chronological recons titution of the musical facts. Instead, its main purpose is to reveal derivative relations between basic elements and all of their elaborations during a given musical narrative, not necessarily preserving the exact temporal order. In the case of Op.78, from what was observed in the whole analysis, it does not matter so much if we consider the components of G the cause (as it was done in chapter 6) or co nsequence of tho se of g 3 (as it would happen if we take strictly Regenlied as the seed of the whole sonata). As shown in several schemes presented in the analysis (especially the genealogical graphs of sections 5.7 and 5.8), the first and third movements k eep tight parent al links in respect to their motivic material (in this context, the second movement plays a somewhat digressive role, as a contrasting intermission). Therefore, we consider that a simple inversion of the “arrow of the time” would not repres ent a great diff erence in the results obtained and that the adoption of the \"normative\" procedure (i.e., to work according to the order of the events expressed in the score) would be then convenient and consistent.", "(2) To take the melody of Regenlied as an acc eptable premise for Op.78 matches the Schoenbergian concept of Idea that, as it was seen in several definitions of chapter 3, is a kind of foreshadow of the proper Grundgestalt (Figure 204 proposes a simple graphic model considering the relations between Idea, Grundgestalt , and the work, in both idealized and concrete versions ). In this case, it is perfectly plausible to consider that, for some reason (that , alas, does not matter here), Brahms used the song ’s melody as basic idea for his sonata, extracting its essential elements for forming the Grundgestalt in the first movement. The melody was then resumed – of course, as a quotation of Regenlied – in the third movement but – very important – in new context", "and development, profoundly influenced by the pre vious derivative work and become in Brahms’ hands, the most adequate continuation for the whole musical narrative.", "Figure 204: Correlations between Idea, Grundgestalt , and a musical work.", "As done with Op.78, the derivative structures of the four movements Miguéz's will be analyzed in the following sections, according to the pre -determined sequence of levels.", "Figure 205: Miguéz – Violin Sonata Op.14 (mm.1 -4): Grundgestalt (MIGUÉZ, 1884, p.1).", "Accordin g to the methodological strategy adopted for MDA’s first level, the six compone nts must be analyzed in detail at first .

In the metric domain, disregarding the short passage in the fugue of the third movement, already examined (see p.129), that seems nothing but a local, superficial event, the whole sonata does not present any metric conflict.

In other terms, Brahms’ sonata presents , globally , a wider tonal spectrum. ▪ Tonal connections – the tonal plan of the entire Op.78 depicts connections that are clearly integrated with a global narrative (as suggested in Fig ures 185 -6). The same does not happen in the case of the Op.14’s tonal pl an, since the chosen keys (A -E-F-", "A) do not seem to be associated with any special relation coming from the pitch structure of the first movement.", "▪ Mediant relations – there are points to be considered: o presence of diatonic mediant regions: while in Op.78 they are eventually employed (i.e., without any apparent structural motivation), in the case of Op.14 their use as main tonal interlocutors to the home key is a consistent and recurrent procedure; o presence of chromatic mediant regions: in the Op.14 they ar e employed almost exclusively in the first movement (as intermediary regions in the Transition, both in the Exposition and in the Recapitulation, as well as in the Development). In Op.78 the chromatic mediants are present in the three movements, playing an important structural role, which is integrated with the derivative domain (see below); o cyclic org anization s: the hexatonic cycle (i.e., considering the recurrent application of Cohn’s PL operations) is present in the whole Op.78 (implicitly in the first m ovement and explicitly in the remaining ones).190 There is only one occurrence of cyclic organizatio n in the Op.14, at the end of the Development of the first movement, in this case a partial octatonic.191", "Derivative elements Developing variation techniques ▪ Thematic transformation & development – thematic derivation in the Op.14 is strongly based on tra nsformation (from the main theme of the first movement, P1 – see Fig ure 286). This technique is also present in the Op.78, but not so intensely, and involving other themes besides P1.1 (Figure 183). Moreover, the thematic associations are in general less e xplicit (with the exception of themes S1.2, first movement, and A.a, third movement).192 As observed in the derivative analysis, Brahms employs markedly develop mental procedures in the genesis of almost all of his themes. On the other", "190 See Figure 44.", "191 As a matter of fact, we could also mention the \"partial\" cyclic configurations (involving operations m/P) cleverly employed by Miguéz in the fourth movement (see Figure 69). Moreover, it is noteworthy to point the employment of symmetrical connections inv olving seventh chords by both composers, depicted by the geometric schemes of the Boretz' Spider (Figure 46) and the Bird-Cage (Figure 51). 192 More precisely, these cases could be better classified as thematic transformation -development (TDT), as discussed in pp. 60 -1.", "hand, a few of the them atic ideas in the Op.14 can also be explained as resulting from development of basic material.", "▪ Linkage – considering only the class of thematic linkage,193 the analysis revealed three cases in Op.78 (two in the first movement and one in the second). In Op.1 4 there is only one instance, in the third movement.", "▪ Metric manipulation – as stated in the fourth level analysis, the Op.78 presents clearly a metric Grundgestalt and a number of related passages with metric dissonances, which reinforce Ng ’s idea about t his characteristic Brahmsian developing variation technique. On the other hand, the Op.14’s Grundgestalt is metrically unproblematic and there are no cases of metric displacements or disturbances along the piece.", "Global organicity ▪ Dissemination – in gener al, the thematic structure of both sonatas present a high rate of parenth ood with the respective Grundgestalt , except in the case of the third movement of Op.14 : differently from what happens in the remaining movements, the themes of both Scherzo and Trio/ Fugue are disconnected from the basic motives (or, at least, are very rem otely related to them).", "▪ Inter -movement relations – interestingly there are in both pieces links not directly associated with the primarily Grundgestalt , but rather to events arisen in the internal movements.194 In Op.78 this kind of connection occurs betwe en the second and third movements; in Op.14, between the second and the fourth.", "▪ Permanent variables – for this quantitative/qualitative comparison the three main permanent variables i n each sonata were considered. This allows us to observe how Op.78’s variables are more pervasive: they are present in all three movements, while in the case of Op.14 just variable X occurs in the entire piece. Another distinctive aspect is the domain’s pr ominence in each s onata: in Brahms three variables are pitch - based195 and one (Z, the dotted motive, the most recurrent) is associated with rhythm. In the case of Miguéz, the opposite occurs, with two rhythmic variables, and just one related to the pitch do main.", "193 In this aspect other types of linkage are not being considered, just those that clearly initiate a theme. Brahms’ sonata presents several other occurrences of metric and harmonic linkages, like that one which i nitiates the recapitulation of the first movement.", "194 This situation corresponds in the analysis to the derivation of temporary variants across movement boundaries (as these variables were intermediary cases between temporary and permanent categories). 195 We consider variables Y and X as forming an unity, since they are tightly connected by derivation.", "▪ Projection of intervals onto tonal plan – as discussed in the fourth level analysis of both pieces, while the basic intervallic relations (notably the minor third and the octave/unison) are deeply present in several structural layers of the tonal pl an of Op.78, there are no such relations in the Op.14.", "It is also pertinent to examine the primary Grundgestalten of both sonatas under the light of the six points that characterize this Schoenbergian principle, synthetized at the end of its theoretical d iscussion (see chapter 3). A seventh point was added to the original list, resulted from the methodological strategy proposed in the present version of the analytical model , namely the hypothesis concern ed to the existence of second -order Grundgestalten (i.e., associated to \"non -first\" movements). Table 30 summarizes the points , here formulated as questions, considering correspondences with the both pieces.", "Table 30: The Grundgestalt en of Opp.78 and 14", "Whilst the affirmative answers in Op.78’s column u ndoubtedly reinforce the organic nature of the piece, in Op.14’s case there are some aspects that deserve be commented. Referring to the first question, the already mentioned \"low organicity rate\" of the Scherzo does not allow us to consider that the primo rdial elements’ influence is extended to the entire sonata (for the same reason, it lacks a consistent connection between the primary Grundgestalt and the second -order Grundgestalt of the third movement, qu estion number 7). The association of this aspect t o the absence of any base for a fourth -level derivative analysis contributes to the partial affirmative answer of question five. Moreover, and differently from", "Brahms’ case, in the Op.14 metric and tonal re lations do not play any role in the derivative structure, which results in a negative answer to question 6.", "Taking all of these considerations as a whole, it is possible to confirm our initial hypothesis that both sonatas are surely organically -constructed works. However, this does not imply that they p resent derivative structures of similar deepness and concentration. Rather, after this detailed analytical process we consider that the Op.78 and Op.14 occupy distinct positions in an a bstract continuum that represents organicism in music. In this imaginar y space, the G -major sonata would be situated in a relatively extreme longitudinal point considering its extraordinary balance of economy, variety, coherence, and amplitude. On the other hand, even though part of the same organic space, Miguéz’ sonata woul d be relatively distant from its counterpart, presenting a kind of epithelial derivative organization, based mainly on parental associations to a basic thematic idea and more or less su perficial development of motivic unities. This combination, though in a lesser extent, provided the necessary amounts of unity and variety for the organic formation of the piece.", "This hypothetic “ developing -variation space” is graphically proposed in Figu re 296 deployed on a Cartesian plan defined by the axes/dimensions of v ariety and coherence. The DV space can be seen as the gr ay band at the center of the plan, including the set of musical pieces composed according to the Grungdgestalt /developing variati on principles (which can be broadly defined as those that present some degree of balance between both dimensions).196 According to this perspective, pieces that privilege one predicate at the expense of the other would be projected outside this space. Two ex treme cases illustrate this situation in the figure: the waltz Blue Dan ube (by Johann Strauss),197 with high coherence and low variety, and a stochastic composition (like Music of Changes , by John Cage) , with high variety and low coherence. Both Brahms’ and Miguéz’ sonatas can be projected in the DV space, with the Op.78 insert ed on a “optimizing” line,198 corresponding to its remarkable balance of both attributes. In turn, the Op.14’s position out of the line (resulting from more", "196 Evidently, we are not proposing here to consider these attributes as physical quantities, it is just an approximate approach aiming at making our arguments clearer. 197 Schoenberg (1990) uses precisely this piece to exemplify a musical construction through repetition of a unique motive, as opposed to use of variation. 198 From this we can launch a new hypothesis, supported by the literature adopted in this study, that most of Brahms’ music would be positioned on or very near the same line. Further research may be carried out to confirm this hypothesis.", "coherence than variety) is mai nly due to Miguéz ’s preference for thematic transformation rather than developmental procedures.", "Figure 2 96: Representation of a hypothetical \"Developing -variation space\" .", "We consider that the systematization and formalization of the derivative analysis provided by the current version of the analytical model which is ap plied in this study allow us to reach these conclusions. In this way it is relevant to mention that the ana lysis in turn represented a considerable improvement of this methodology. Evidently, there is a lot still to be done for a complete systematization o f the analytical process (for example, to extend the current thematic approach to the piece which is being analyzed), which may be a useful and interesting trend of future research.", "As a matter of fact, however, we consider that the objectives of this wor k were plainly fulfilled. Not only, the derivative thematic structures of both sonatas were explained in details, but it was also possible to examine and discuss some theoretical concepts and principles. In this aspect we can mention our proposal of presen ting precise definitions of Schoenberg’s principles of Grundgestalt and developing variation, the inclusion of Frisch’s techniques of linkage, metric manipulation and thematic transformation/development, and especially the discussion about correlations bet ween musical and biological variation, one of the most important elements in the formation of the new version of the analytical model and, perhaps, our more far -reaching contribution for the theory of musical variation .", "RUFER, Joseph.

However, biological medicines, beside s the high value, are characterized by having a less stable molecular structure, hence it deman ds special cares of storage, being the most important of them keep the temperature control in a range between 2 and 8° C. Besides, the production of those medici ne is concentrated in spec ific parts of the world (Europe and USA), hence in many cases long tr ansportations are necessary to take this product to attend the demand in different parts of the world. So, a good supply chain structure is critical in this sect or, since the impact of an y waste would be too high, for being extremely expensive products and that cause a high impact in patients’ lives.", "In the last decade, many patents of biological drugs have expired, opening the market for the called biosimilars me dicines. This fact generate d important consequences for developed markets (Europe and USA), sho wing a price reduction and a raise on the demand for this kind of medicines. That is not Brazilian reality yet, but Brazilian government have tried to develop th is sector, because biologic al medicines represent an important part of the budget destinated to health care.", "The results show that, from the logistics perspective, the biggest challenge of supply chain is the temperature control, especially guarantee the e nd-to-end control. For the development of biopharmaceutical sector in Brazil, considering that there will be an expansion of demand for biosimilars, there will be many critical factors. For big companies, the trend is to keep the manufacturing centralized in Europe and the USA, but they may develop specific production areas in other countries, aimi ng to stay close from important markets. Brazilian government have tried to develop this sector trough the initiative called PDPs (Parceria para o Desenvolviment o Produtivo), but this prog ram alone wi ll not be enough to develop the entire sector. According to specialists, quality is crucial when we are talking about biological drugs, so qualified workforce, specialized third party logistics providers and good logi stics structure plays an im portant role to develop the biopharmaceutical sector. Besides, other factors also show important impacts in the decision of a company invest in a specific country, like tax incentives and political -economic stability. In Brazil, the regulation of biopharma ceutical sec tor is quite strict (as it is supposed to be), but it is extremely slow. For example, in Brazil it takes much longer time to approve a new medicine if compared to other countries, what is a critical point in a sector that works with an extremel y expensive product, and high investments in R&D, generating innovat ion all the time.", "Keywords: supply chain, logistics, cold chain, biopharmaceutical , biological drugs", "LIST OF ILUSTRATIONS", "LIST OF TABLES", "Table 06: Academic literature x Non -academic sources x Author’s contribution………….5 1", "LIST OF ABREVIATIONS", "3PL Third Party Logistics", "ANVISA Agência Nacional de Vigilância Sanitária API Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient ASTM American Society for Testing and Materials CSCMP Council of Supply Chain Management Professional DC Distribution Center EMA European Medica l Agency FDA Food and Drug Administration GMP Good Manufacturing Practices IAPO International Alliance of Patients' Organization LSP Logistics Service Providers OTC Over the Counter PDP Parceria para o Desenvolvime nto Produtivo PSC Pharmaceutical Supply C hain R&D Research and Development RDC Resolução de Diretoria Colegiada SCM Supply Chain Management SUS Sitema Único de Saúde SUT Single -Use Technologies UK United Kingdom USA United States of America USD US dollar s WHO World Health Organizatio", "CONTENTS", "2.4.1. Impact of biological drugs and biosimilars on the pharmaceutical sector and", "INTRODUCTION", "1.1 CONTEXT, OBJECTIVES AND RELEVANCE OF THE STUDY", "Biological drugs are a complex kind of medicines, produced in a living s ystem, like microorganism, plant or animal cell, and are often more difficult to characteriz e than small molecule drugs (FDA, n.d.) . These drugs have grown in importance because they are capable to treat chronic conditions with good results, t hat are not achieved by regular chemical medicines, like vari ous forms of cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, mu ltiple sclerosis, anemia, control and cure conditions such as AIDS, heart disease, among others (Brajcich, Friesner, & Biosimilar is a medicine proved to be highly similar to an already appr oved biological medicine (called “reference medicine”) (EMA, 2017a) and can be produced after the expiration of the patent’s protection of the original biological drug. The European U nion was the first to make moves on the investments on biosi milars and, in 2006, the first of this kind of medicine was approved there, while only in 2013 it begun to be analyzed by Food and Drug Administration (FDA) , in the USA (Fuhr & Blackstone, 2013) .", "Companies believe in the potential of this sector and have invested heavily on it in the past few decades. According to a research of McKinsey consulting firm, from 1995 to 2012, the number of biotech patents applied grew at 25 percent annually in this period (Otto, Alberto, & Schrader, 201 4). The website marketwatch.com says that the biosimilar market in Europe reached US$ 2,013 Million in 2017 and it is projected to exceed 9 billion USD by 2023, at a grow th of 29% during 2017 -2023 (ResearchAndMarkets, 2018) . In the United States, the expenditure in this market is expected to quadruple between 2018 and 2020 (Harrington, 201 8). These investments are justified by recent results: in 2017, biologic drugs represented 1.9% of all U.S. prescriptions, but 37.4% of net drug spending (Aitken & Kleinrock, 2018) .", "According to “Agência Nacional de Vigilância Sanitária” (ANVISA - the Brazil ian agency that regulates the Brazilian pharmaceutical sector), in 2016 the generics were responsible for 75.7% of synthetic drugs’ market in Brazil (ANVISA, 2018) , number similar to countries like Netherlands (69.7%) and Canada (70%), and close to countries like the USA (84%) and UK (83.4%). Those numbers are very importa nt because of the current moment of the biopharmaceutical sector . A growing number of patents have been expired since 2013", "(Jozala et al., 2016) and may follow a similar trend of generics, even though in a smaller scale, due the price of those medicines (Interfarma, 2012) . So, if the demand o f this kind of products (that needs an especial care) increases, what will be the challenges for this sector? This study intends to contribute to understand some aspects of that question. Biological medicines tend to be heat sensitive and must be kept in a temperature between 2 and 8º C (Harrington & Smith , 2015) . They are also susceptible to microbial contamination, hence specific cares and structure are necessary , demanding specialized services in the biopharmaceutica l supply chain , since the initial manufacturing steps until the applicat ion on the final consumer , wh at is also a new challenge, if compared to most conventional drugs (FDA, 2018 ; Rodrigues, Mart ins, Wanke, & Siegler, 2018) A survey from World Economic Forum in 2017, shows inadequate supply infrastructure as the fifth most problematic factor for doing business in Brazil (World Economic Forum, 2018a) . The competitiveness index still sho ws Brazil in the 73th position out of 137 countries in the infras tructure index, that analyze parameters like quality of overall infrastructure (which Brazil achieved the 108th position), roads, railroads infrastructure, ports infrastructure, air transport infrastructu re, among others (World Ec onomic Forum, 2018b) . The same survey still shows Brazil with bad customs procedures, what harm business that depend on import ation . This infrastructure gap allied to the logisti cs ch allenges inherent of biopharmaceutical supply chain makes it be an impor tant issue in the development of biopharmaceutical sector in this cou ntry.", "Despite the high cost of the biological medici nes, the sensitivity of these products to environmental conditions (like heat), their short sh elf life, as well as their high prices and impact on patients’ lives (Francas, 2018; IAPO, 2013) , there are very few studies focused on their supply chain challenges, especially in Latin Americ a. Therefore, the main research question of this study is: What are the biopha rmaceutical supply chain c hallenges in Brazil? In order to answer this main question, the specific objectives are: to verify wh at have been discussed in Brazil and in other count ries about biological drugs and biosimilars; to identify important aspects tha t impact the development o f the biopharmaceutical sector (and the biosimilar expansion) in Brazil; to draw the Brazilian biolog ical drugs s upply chain; and to identify the main c hallenges related to the storage and distribution of biological drugs and biosimilars.", "Regardless of the main focus in this study be the final steps of the supply chain (storage and distribution), the rese arch will an alyze different aspects of the ecosyste m, like regulation, that impact the development of the sector in Brazil. In or der to have a good referen ce, the study looks at the European and North American experiences (that are more advanced in the biopharmaceutic al sector) as a reference to gather inf ormation and bring it to the Brazilian reality.", "The relevance of this study li es not only in the theme b y itself (biological drugs) and the impact they have on society, but also for having a focus on a lit tle explored field, that is the study of these medi cines’ supply chain. Those specific needs of storage (that bring with them asks for like specific infras tructure, skills and technology), aligned with the high cost of distribution and the impact on pati ents’ lives, makes the efficiency of the biopharmaceu tical supply chain be a very relevant topic for this sector (Lokko et al., 2018) . Other products, like fruits, meat, chemical material or even microchips may also demand temperature control storage (Rodrigues et al., 2018) , but at this study when we refer to “cold chain”, we will be talking about the biological medicines’ supply chain.", "Specifically in the case of Brazil, that is a country with a huge territory and that faces a lot of g aps in its l ogistics netw ork and structure (Avosani & Malebranche, 201 6), understanding the biopharmaceutical supply chain challenges becomes a critical pat h to enable biological medicines to arrive in the final consumer with the necessary quality and safety, since s pecific logistics is necessary to keep th ose standards (Lo kko et al., 2018). So, studying the experience of developed countries and the challenge s in the market are essential steps in order to better enable a possible expansion of those product s (biologica l drugs and biosimilars) that can generat e a positive impa ct on the quality of life of the Brazilian population. This research also aims to have a broad view of biopharmaceutical sector, bringing the challenges to develop the biological medicin es market (c onsidering both, reference and biosimilar s) in Brazil.", "1.2 RES EARCH DELIMITATIONS", "This study investigates some different aspects around the biopharma ceutical supply chain, but there are delimitations in its scope. Despite the focus be the fi nal steps of the supply chain (storage and distribution), th e study will also approach aspects like key elements for the development of the sector in Brazil but wil l not explore deeply all the aspects of", "organizations strategy , like scenario analysis , market, competition, among others . By studying those key eleme nts in Brazil, the research also aims to be a source of infor mation to understand challenges that may eme rge in developing countries for the expansion of a sector, like the biopharmaceutical, that demands specialized logistics services. Although Brazilian logistics network i s an important bottleneck (that also motiv ated the research), the idea is not to evalu ate the network itself, but challenges inherent of the products that must be overcome. Examples of biopharmaceuticals include a wide range of products, like vaccines, blo od components, allergenics, somatic cells, gene therapy, tissues, and recombinant ther apeutic proteins (FDA, 2018) , but this study will focus on the called new biological drugs, those with high c ost, administrated to treat chronic diseas es like cancer, rheumatoid arthritis and AIDS, which patents have started to expire since 2007 and where most investment have been done.", "Also, this research will not exhaust all the norms from the main regulation agencies studied, like the European Medica l Agency (EMA), Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and ANVISA . The focus will be on Brazilian norms relat ed to regulation of biopharmaceuticals authorization, storage and transport, like RDC 234/ 2005, RDC 55/ 2010 and RDC 304/ 2019. International norms we re used to specific consultations and were not deeply studied .", "Another delimitation of this research is t hat it is focused on the perception of executives and specialists of some companies that are part of the biop harmaceutical supply chain (from both publ ic and private secto rs) and do not include patients’ point of view. Despite bringing professionals from m ultinational companies to the study, they are based in Brazil, so the field study shows the reality of this c ountry.", "Finally, the study will approach t he new biological me dicines and biosimilar market and their c haracteristics in general, not covering issu es related to any specific medicine.", "2.

In the case of the pharmaceutical supply chain, to deliver medicines at the correc t places, in time, in the correct quantit ies and at the low est possible cost (Yadav, Tata, & Babaley , 2011) , in order to be available to patients whenever it is necessary. The main players at this supply chain are the pharmac eutical companies (responsible for the development and manufacturing of the drugs), the w holesalers (responsible for storage and d istribution of the products) and the retailers (who make the sales for the final customers) (Silva, 2018 ; Chircu, Sultan ow, & Saraswat, 2014 ; Yadav , Tata, & B abaley, 2011 ; Pedroso & Nakano, 2009) . Due to the low technica l complexity, the transportation to retail pharmacies can be done by the wholesaler’s own fleet of vehicles, a third -party company or by the retailers them selves (Yadav et al., 2 011).

So, these authorities need to ensure the quality, safety, and efficacy of all medicines in their countries (Sravika et al., 2017) , what makes a huge influence on this market operations . Besides, in many countries (like Brazil) the government is an important purchaser of medicines thr ough public hospit als (Pedroso & Na kano, 2009) .

Besides the heat sensitivity and the need of a special care about conta mination, the b iological drugs have a shorter shelf life (Francas, 2018) , wha t also turns to be a logistic challenge, e specially in the cases that production is concentrated in one (o r few) countries to distribute to the world market.", "Examples of bio pharmaceuticals include a wide range of products , like vacci nes, blood and blood co mponents, allergenics, somatic cells, gene therapy, t issues, and recombinant therapeutic proteins (FDA, 2018) .

In the b iopharmaceutical se ctor there are also the medicines called biobetters and biosimilars , that have played an important role in the development of this sector.", "Fuhr and Blackstone (2 013) state that biobetters are biologics that exhibit superior ity over the brand ed biologic in dimensions , such as efficie ncy or clinical speci ficity , and th eir importance is that , for the same component, they permit different approaches to drug delivery administration. The first biological drugs were predominantly u sed by injections. With the advance of biobetters , more stable (in their chemical structure) th an reference medicines , there are different ways to administrate it , such as oral, dermatological and inhaled formulations . Those different encapsulation approaches aim to minimiz e the biologic instability on the processe s of the biological d rugs and make it easier to be administrated by patients (Jozala et al., 2016) .", "A biosimilar drug is a medicine highly similar to another biological existent on the market, the called reference medicine. Compan ies can market approve biosimilars once the perio d of market protection of the reference me dicine expires. Those medicines mus t be tested and show no meaningful differences in clinical performance when compared to the reference ones, presenting the same qu ality, safety and efficacy (EMA, 2017) . It is important to be explained that biosimilars are not generic medicines. Due to the natural variability of the biological source and manufacturing process, minor differences can occu r between the", "biosimilar and its refere nce medicine . Actually, there may be minor differences even between two different batches of the same manufacturer. For this reason, s trict controls are always in place during manufacturing to ensure that minor differ ences do not affect the way the medicin e works or its safety. T hus, these di fferences are not clinically meaningful in terms of safety or eff icacy (EMA, 2017b) .", "Besides the cost reduction of biosimilars compare d to the reference products, it is important to remember that b iotechnology is expensive, so it can’t be expected that biosimilars become as cheap as chemical drugs , at least in a short term . The aver age cost to develop a biological agent is $1.2 billion d ollars and takes from 10 to 15 year s in this process, while bio similars spe nd from $75 to $250 million dollars and the development takes between 5 and 9 years. It is a great improvement, but the inves tment can’t be compared to regular chemical drugs that demand around $650 million dollars a nd take 8 years to develop a new medicin e, and $3 million dollars and 3 years to develop a generic (Ventola, 2013 ; IAPO, Biologics are considered an important innovation made by the pharmaceutical ind ustry, because they successfully addressed previously un met therapeutic needs. Since their introduction, they have beco me each time more important in terms of new products devel opment, clinical use, and health care expenditures (Ventola, 2013) . With this expansion and growth in terms of representativenes s of the biologics, it gets obvious the importance of the biosimilars. The market price of this kind of drugs is extrem ely high if compared to conventional drugs and, with the b eginning of the expiration of the first patents, it expected that biosimilars f ollow the same trend of expansion that happened with the generic medicines (Ventola, 2013) , even though i n a smaller scale due to the price of those medicines (Interfarma, 2012) . However, a deep er impact in the sector will happen due t o the character istics of those products, that invo lves much more money and tim e to develop (Feifei, Cuiqin, & Feifei, 2013) , as well as a more c omplex structure in terms of technology (Gurǎu, 2004), production and distribution (Otto, Alberto, & Schrader, 201 4; Rodrigues et al., 2018) , all that compensated by the positive impact on t he patients’ life.", "An IQVIA report shows that the overall price per treatment day fell up to 39% after the introduction of the respective b iosimi lar and 18 out of th e top -20 brand ed drugs will be facing the competition of biosimilars until 20 23 (IQVIA, 2019) .

Due the fact that vaccines are also a kind of biopharmaceutical, it shares some logistics challenges with the called new biological drugs as, for example , the need of being ke pt in a controlled temperature between 2 and 8º C (Fontainha & Leiras, 2017) .", "A big growth on the vaccines’ demand can be a concern for this cold chain in developing coun tries because of the capability of the existing supply chain structure to absorb a new demand (Chen et al., 2014) . The expansion of biosimilars (on e of the concerns of this research) can generate a similar problem, dem anding a growth from the structure of the biological drugs supply chain, showing the importance of a previous planning for the possibility of this expansion . So, observing the existing similarities can be a good so urce of information to study the biologica l drugs supply chain.", "However, vaccines have other kind of challenges in the supply chain , like seasonality, uncertainty on demand, and high lead time (Sadjadi, Ziaei, & Pishvaee, 2019) . High research and production costs or high prices, for example , were not found in the liter ature. Some important vacc ines, like for hepatitis B, don’t cost mor e than 3 dollars per dose (WHO, 2005) , what can help to explain the lack of worries about cost s and represents a huge difference in terms of the supply chain management , when compared to the new biological drugs. Vaccines are a way to prevent some diseases (Fontainha & Leiras, 2017) while biological drugs represent new possibilities (with good results) for di seases that couldn’t be properly treated so far. Another important difference is related to product waste. A ccording to WHO (2004) , the", "accep table level of waste for vaccines varies a lot depending on the local situation (of each country), among other fact ors, but it can vary from 5% to 50% . Even in the most conservati ve situation (5% of waste) , it would be to o much for products as expensive as the new biological medicines . Bringing to the Brazilian reality, even though Brazil has great experience with vaccines , it is not possible to assume tha t this country has the nec essary supply chain structure to face a po ssible increase in demand for biosi milar medicines . In this sense, although they share some challenges , vaccines and new biologica l drugs can be considered two different businesses .", "As the objective of this resear ch is to understand the challenges of bio pharmaceutical supply chain and the challenges that a possible expansion of the new biological drugs (and biosimilars) can bring to this supply chain , vaccines supply chain literature were used just as one of the so urces of the research (especially for the logistics challenges) , not going in depth into it .", "2.3.3. Regulation in the biopharmaceutical sector", "Regul ation is also an issue to be addressed. Currently, each country has its own rule (FDA in the United States, EMA in Europe, Anvisa in Brazil etc.), despite th e existence of guidelines from the World Health Organization (WHO, n.d.) . On this literature review, regulation will be seen with two different focuses: international and Brazilian norms. The objective of do ing so is to compare diffe rent standards and to show what are the ma in discussion and worries in each o f them , to check how Brazilian regulators are working if compared to international standards.", "Several sources highlighted the strong regulation of the se ctor and that it is gettin g stricter , not only academic ones (Rossetti et al., 2011 ; Feifei et al., 2013) , but also non - academic sources (Shanley, 2018 ; Harrington, 2018) .", "Regarding the international regulation , the main concerns related to the biopharmaceutical supply were storing conditions, transportation an d biosimilarity. European Union wa s pioneer in approval of biosimilar drugs. According to the organization IAPO (2013) , EMA’s first guidelines for biosimilar medicines were in 2005. In 2007 , there were already biosim ilars available in this re gion, while the United States entered in that run later, pro ducing this kind of medicine just in 2013 (Fuhr & Blac kstone, 2013) , after the creation of the first abbreviated approval pathway for biosimilars in 2010 (FDA, 2016) .", "Since then , discussions, norms and l ots of investment have been made in order to regulate and develop this market .", "Biosimilarity still is an important discussion because each country (or group, like European Union) has its own regulation, hence the standards varies all over the world. The World Health Organization (WHO) published it s first guideline for biosimilars a pproval in 2010 (IAPO, 2013) , what was an important first step , but it does not guarantee its full accomplishing by local agencies.", "It is interesting to notice how non -academic sources get worried about temperature control and the regulation s around it (and its expansion). Some of t hem show worries about temperature control through all the biopharmaceutical supply chain. Long periods out of the correct range can harm the effectiveness of the drugs, what becomes an im portant issue for regulato ry agencies, due to the impact on patients ’ lives (Transparency Market Research, 2017 ; Harrington, 2018) . For co mpanies, not only the impa ct on the quality of the medicines, but al so the huge financial impact of losing a batch becomes a major worry, due to the value of th ese drugs . Shanley (2018) focus on specific shipping regulation that considers not only temperature control concerns, but also other iss ues duri ng the transportation, lik e shocks, leaks and contamination. This au thor highlights that there is no in ternational shipment condition defined, a gap that had been fulfilled by specific organizations that developed some standards.", "In Brazil, ANVISA is the g overnment agency responsib le by the regulation of the sector. There are several norms that contain pieces of different aspects of the biopharmaceutical industry. The first norm covered by this study dates from 2005 ( RDC 234/2005 ), that regulates t he qualit y of biological products i n Brazil in a broad way. Brazilian regula tion does not use the definition of “biosimilar”. At RDC 55/2010, ANVISA brings some types of biological products, being the focus of th is study the two following (in a free trans lation fr om Portuguese): new biolog ical products ( Produtos biológicos novos ); and biological products (not new) . The first one would be those that have been called just as “biological drugs” at this paper so far, and the second one, the “biosimilars”.", "However, in Brazilian norms, the regis tration of biosimilars can follow two diff erent paths, originating other two classifications : Biological products registered by comparability", "(via de desenvolvimento por comparabilidade ) – it is necessary to pass throu gh all the t ests of comparability, just like the biosimilars. (Interfarma, 2012) ; and Biological products registered in a single way (via de dese nvolvimento individual ) - it is a simp ler and faster way to approve certain medi cine, making no comparation to the reference drug ; it requires information about development, production, quality control and clinic and non -clinic data to demonstrate quality, efficacy an d safety of the product (ANVISA, 2010b) . Figure 02 represents this classification :", "Figure 02: Brazilian classificatio n of biological products scheme Source: Adapted from Interfarma (2012) Brazilian legislation about biologi cal drugs and biosimilars is complex and tend to approach the subject in a broad way (Peres, Padilha , & Quental, 2013) . Despite having some particularities, Brazilian norms try to follow international standards, like the good manufacturing practices (GMP) , from the 37th technical report from the World Health Organization (WHO) (ANVISA, 2010a) .", "ANVISA also brought a guide f or transportation of biological products that brings some guidelines for producers and suppliers, but does not bring the power of a norm and is not very specific in some a spects (ANVISA, 2017) .", "In the material studied in this literature review, it could be realized that B razilian norms have a strong focus on registration of new medicines in the regulation agency , even bringing different classifications if compared to the world’s benchmark (EMA, W HO and FDA) . However, it is a complex, dec entralized regulation and still need s a more specific and technical approach when related to storage and transportation conditions.", "2.4 The biopharmaceutical supply chain", "Also known as “cold chain” due to especial nee ds of these medicines to be stored (being one of them, the temperature control ), the biopharmaceutical sector ha s shown impressive growth around the world in the past years and it is expected to keep receiving even more investment s (IQVIA, 2019) .", "2.4.1. Impact of biological drugs and bios imilars on the pharmaceutical sector and the main challenges in the biopharmaceutical supply chain As it was commented before, biological drugs won’t impact just patient s’ lives, for being capable to generate better results on the treatment of some disease s when compared to regular drugs. The expansion of those products will impact the ecosystem as a whole , from regulation agencies , researchers and the producers’ suppliers, to distribut ors and retailers. The raw material necessary to produce biological drug s is very different from the synthetic ones; therefore, many suppliers are also different companies. The website Pharmaceutical Outsourcing support s the idea of a more complex raw mate rial supply, because producers needs specialized compounds, with smaller volumes, resulting in a greater number of suppliers, from different locations around the world (Singh, 2016) . Due to the needs of environment control (temperature and humidit y), the cold chain requires a specialized distribution network (Rossetti et al., 2011) . Hence, just the distributor s able to attend those requirements will be kept in this new supply chain, opening space for new specialized companies. It is worthy to remember that some biological products are not something new, like vaccines, however the demand for this specialized war ehousing and transportation service will grow and new legisl ations have been created for the new products, so even companies with some kind of environment control in their operations, must adapt to receive this new demand.", "For Rossetti et al. (2011) , a huge innovation in the supply process to be e xplored is the direct shipment combined with patients management. As some medicines can be applied by patients’ themselves, a service to support them in information regarding administr ation of the product, h ow to proper store it at home and other issues are also role s to be played and it can be done by different players in the supply chain, depending on each company strategy. That kind of service is also a demand brought with the advanc e of biological drugs.", "Biological p roducts must be stored in a cold, t emperature -controlled environment; otherwise , it can harm the efficacy of the drugs, resulting in a loss of the batch or a risk to patients. The high value of biological medicines make s the distribution control even more critical, rising the impact of the risks (Harrington, 2018) . Those products can be so sensitiv e to environment control, that long travels, through different climate zones, become a risk to be controlled by logistic operators, just like the number of hands -off, due to shocks tha t loads can suffer on the way from production centers to the final consu mer (Harrington, 2018 ; Shanley, Temperature control is so important for biopharmaceuticals that new technologies has been adapted to support logistics activities. When we are talking about packaging, there are two basic categories related to tempe rature contr ol: active and passive systems. Active systems use an energy source combined with thermostatic control to maintain temperature , while the passive ones, use conventional packages associated with mate rials such as water/ice or dry ice to keep pro ducts at the desired temperature (Harrington & Smith, 2015) . Blockchain is a shared, immutable ledger that facilitates the process of record ing transactions and tracking assets in a business network (Gupta, 2019) . So, a iming to control the temperature troug h the suppl y chain, internet of things ( IoT) and block chain are also technologies with a good suitability to the cold chain , being able to keep the record of the medicines ’ temperature durin g its life, providing a higher level of supply chain visibility a nd security that complements the container’s temperature security (Hampstead, 2018) . Leaks and bacterial contamina tion, water hammer and stress (in shipping transportation) are also issues to b e cared and more critical if compared to regular pharmaceutical supply chain (Shanley , 2018) . Francas (2018) also highlights the constraints of a shorter shelf life of biological medicines.", "2.4.2. Third party logistics (3PL) and the cold chain", "A practice that has grown in t he past decades in several sectors is hiring specialized logistics service prov iders (LSPs) to take care of some activities of the supply chain, like warehousing and transportation (Maloni & Carter, 2006 ; Marchet, Melacini, Sassi, & Tappia, 2017) . There are three main r easons for a company hire third party logistics providers: (1) cost reduction , due to the expertise and e conomies of scale of 3PL providers ; (2) service", "improvements , resulting from 3PL provider focus and specialization ; and (3) intention of the company to focus on its core competencies (Malon i & Carter, 2006) .", "This trend has not only been followed by the pharmac eutical sector as a whole, but it seems to be especially coherent to be practic ed for the biopharmaceutical sector (Grand View Research, 2019) . Biological drugs producers, as it was me ntioned before, are very specialized companies (demanding focus and investments from them), but that also needs a specific bo dy of competences in the logistics operations. Hence , all the three reasons to use third -party logistics services seem to fit very well in the biopharmaceutical sector.", "2.4.3. Innovation on consumer experience", "As it was said before, the first generation of biolo gical drugs were predominant used by injections, so they should be administrated by trained professionals; however, researchers have put effort to develop biological medicines capable to be used by other simpler ways, like oral. Despite being easier to be administrated, biobetters still must be stored in pr oper conditions and some of them may need guidance for application, so there ar e companies beginning to improve the final consumer experience by providing services, due to the special characteristics and conditions that biological drugs must be kept (Rossetti et al., 2011 ). In this sense, i n order to deliver more to the client and become mo re competitive, the pharmaceutical companies have tried to create more value by adding service to produ cts, a process known as servitization (Baines, Lightfoot, Benedettini, & Kay, 2009) . It means that they are not just worried to make products available for clients to buy, but also seeking t o make the purchase expe rience easier, more pleasant, faster, less risky and supportive, so that client s can perceive value in the company’s product or brand. Products and servi ces are not a binary choice for companies provide to their clients. Actually, t hey are two sides of a spectrum, where in one extreme is “service” and in the other is “product”. A compa ny can be closer to provide just something tangible (pure product) or pu re service. However, most of them tend to have a mix of products and service (a nd be positioned deliver ing more of one or the other) (Slack, 2013) and it is each time more common to have this complementarity. So, as it was said before, if a pharmaceutical company develops a strategy of delivery m ore than just a product, like patients support to store, administrate, stock control or other services, i t can be saw as a servitization process.", "2.4.4. Parcerias para o Desenvolvimen to Produtivo (PDPs )", "Brazilian government considered biological medicines so stra tegic that created the Productive Development Partnerships - PDPs (“ Parcerias para o Desenvolvimento Prod utivo ”), defin ing its rules in 2012 and review ing them in 2014 (Rocha, 2019) . In 2016, 26 biological drugs represented 51% of the government budget destinated to purchase medicines to distribute to the pop ulation (Maciel, 2016) . At that time, the biopharmaceutical sector was not well developed in Brazil (except for vaccines) , making the Brazilian government have huge expenses to import these medicines.", "The idea of PDPs is to create a joint venture, bringing together three stakeholders: a govern ment al institution to receive the technology ; an institution (priv ate or government al) to produce the APIs (Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients) in the Brazilian territory ; and the instituti on that holds the technology to transfer to th e first one (Varrichio, 2017) . The advan tage provided to the technology developer is that the Brazilian government guarantees the purchasing of t he medicine for a determined period of time and price stated in a contract. The objective of this program is to enlarge the access to strategic medicin es and to reduce the vulnerability of the Brazilian public health system (SUS) ; reduce technological and production dependency; improve governme nt investments ; incentive nat ional technological development ; develop the production of strategic medicines in t he country; among others (SAUDE, 2019) . The Brazilian government aimed to save about R$5.3 billion ( approximately 1.5 billion dollars) per ye ar w ith this program (Maciel, 2016) . It is important to say that biological drugs are not the only product at this program, but they have an important role on", "2.5 Literature review find ings", "Aiming to have a better general view of the main findings of the literature review , it was decided to group it in dimen sions. There is no agreement about what are the critical dimensions when we are talking about supply chai n management (SCM) (Deshpande, 2012) , so different researches will chose the proper on es, depending on the focus of their analysis, as it could be seen in different studies (Chandak, Chandak, & D alpati, 2019; Chandra & Kumar, 2019a; Dalal & Athavale, 2012; Deshpande, 2012; Kess , 2012; M iranda, 2002; Sahay, Gupta, & Mohan, 2006) .

METHOD", "3.1 DEFINITION OF THE RESEARCH QUESTION", "The f irst step for defining the research question was to identify the importance of biological drugs, their investment and register growth in the past decade, as well as the special conditi ons they need to be produced and stored. Besides, it was fundamental to check during the literature review the growth of the biosimilar industry, espec ially in Europe and United States , with a substantial numb er of patents expiring . Allying that two inform ation was the key point to develop the main research question: What are biopharmaceutical supply chain logistics challenges? More specifically, what ar e the main challenges of storage and distribution faced by this industry in order to properly delivery th ose medicines to the final consumer?", "These questions are very important in a country like Brazil, that has a huge territory and a deficient logistics s tructure (Avosani & Malebranche, 2016) . Understanding storage and distri bution challenges becomes imperative to enable biological medicines to arrive in the final consumer with the necessary quality and safety , since spec ialized logistics are necessary", "to keep those standards . So, it becomes a part of the path to develop the b iopharmaceutical sector in this country .", "3.2 RESEARCH TYPE", "Research approaches ar e the guidelines for data collection, analysis and interpretation. The choice of an approach should be based on the research problem or issue being add ressed. The method can be classified as qualitative, quantitative or mixed (Creswell, Quantitative approach aims to test objective theories, examining the relationship among the selected variables using statistics as an essential tool. On the other hand, qualitative research involves emerging quest ions and procedures, using inductive data analysis to build from particular to general themes to generate an interpretation of the data collected. Finally, mixed methods use both qualitative and quantitative approac hes in order to provide a more complete u nderstanding of the research problem, generating and testing theoretical frameworks (Creswell, 2014) .", "A qualitative research has some characteristics, like interpre tation rather t han quantification, subjectivity, flexibility during the work and fo cus on th e process observed, among others (Kohlbacher, 2006) . Using this mind set, it was analyzed the goal of the study and the qualitati ve approach showed to be the natural path for this research , using an inductive process, whe re knowledge is built from the data found , generalizing to a broad er theme or model (Creswell, 2014) .", "Considering the just mentioned elements, the qualita tive approach showed to be the natural path for this research, using an inductive proces s, where knowledge is built from the data found, generalizing to a broad themes or model (Creswell, 2014). Besides, during the literature review, it was shown a gap in the knowledge when looking for information about the biopharmaceuticals supply chain and their logistic challenges, due to the small amount of studies f ound around this issue. Intending to contribute to f ulfill this gap, the logical way was making an explo ratory overview about the theme.", "3.3 DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS", "As it was said befo re, the literature review was not limited to academic information due t o the small number of works about the studied issue, so non -academic s ources were used", "in order to gathe r more information and develop a better overview about the biotechnological secto r.

Some of them also demand high quality and specialized producers (like machinery and deionized wa ter), while others are just regular suppliers.", "As it was mentioned before, the production of a biopharmaceutical can be made in two stages: first , the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) is made and, then, the production is finished. API’s p roduction is not made in Brazi l, so it is an imported input for local manufacturers. Becaus e of that, three implications can be highlighted: 1 ) dependence on external producers; 2) higher costs (because it is the most complex stage); 3) greater complexity in the suppl y chain, because o f the longer transportation and especially because of the cus toms clea rance.", "Customs clearance was highlighted i n this supply chain draw because of its impacts on the process. In Brazil, this stage can take days, reinforcin g the bad result of customs proce dures in the World Economic Forum surve y (World Economic Forum, 2018b) , what adds ris k to such a sensitive process. It not only r ises the time that logistics operator must keep th e material in a cold temperature during transpor tation, but the biological products also must pass through another handoff and inspection, what makes harder to keep temperatu re control and adds s tages where the process can fail . Frequently , specialized com panies are hired to provide customs services in order to make a better management on this stage. Production (final stages) can be made by the public or private sectors, often with the incentive o f PDPs. Usually , they are located in the southeast of Brazil (Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo). It requires less -complex activities if compared to API production, but still demands qualified workforce and high quality control, including, of course, temperatur e control. After produced, the biological drugs are stored in a controlled environment and follows to distrib utors.", "There aren’t many distributors for biopharmaceutical medicines in Brazil, so it is a very concentrated market. Their op erations are spread er when compared t o producers, but it is still present in a few states. Those are specialized companies that co ncentrate purchases and deliver biological drugs to hospitals, clinics and, in very specific cases (like insulins), to drugsto res. They concentrate not only the demand from different places, but also differen t biopharmaceuticals (called specialties) that d emand the same kind of temperature control, like biological drugs, insulins and vaccines.", "Most demand for biological drugs comes from the Brazilian government that is obligated to provide treatment in hospita ls (including providing the necessary medicines) . Then, as a general rule, those drugs go to public hospitals and clinics, where they are administrated to patients (the final consumers).", "This vi sual model is important not only to understand the biopharmac eutical supply chain and its actors , but also br ings the perception that it i s not just a small variation of the classic PSC . The changes are so relevant that it can be consi dered that it was created a new supply chain, also called the cold chain. To analy ze this statement, we looked for definitions of supply chai n (in a broad sense). Among others, it was found at the Council of Supply Chain Management Professional (CSCMP) web site the definitio n gave by Vitasek (2013, p. 186): “The mater ial and informational interchanges in the logistical process stretching from acquisition of raw materials to delivery of finis hed products to the e nd user.

The website Pharmaceutical Outsourcing support s the idea of a more complex raw material supply, because producers needs specialized compounds, with smaller volumes, resulting in a greater number of suppliers, from different locations around the world (Singh, 2016) , what support the idea of different suppliers.", "Using the definition of supply chain of Vitasek (2013) and the in formation from MacCarthy, Blome, Olh ager, Srai, & Zhao (2016 ); Rossetti et al. (2011) and Singh (2016) , we could realize that, if compared to the PSC, the biopharmaceutical supply chain use different raw materia ls, having different suppliers and demanding some different s ervices, with different characteristics, so, in the interpretation of the author , those really are different supply chain s.", "Despite being different supply chains, f or compani es that produce both kinds of medicine (biological and synthetics) it was found a t the interviews that it is possible to share a few resources, even though there were different opinions about how deep is this possib ility. The perspective got abou t this top ic is the possibilit y of gains in economies of scope . The", "main resources that can be shared are warehouse, even having two separat e warehouses, one for cold temperatures and the other for regular ones, they can be at the same site, generating saving; trans portation, just in c ases where synthetics medicines have to be at the same range of temperature of biologics (it is not usual , but possible); office work, using the same idea of shared service organizations . One last possibility is to share the logistics s upplier (if this company is able to provide both services), having one bigger con tract and negotiating better conditions. From the perspective of production, it is very unlikely that those two kinds of medici nes can share resources.", "4.1.2.

However, different from previous studies, other cares about the storage and tra nsportation of biolo gical drugs were not mentioned as important issues, like shoc ks, that was highlighted by Shanley (2018) . Leak s and contamination , present in the articles of Shanley (2018 ) and Singh (2016) , is taken more like an operation challenge and a general requirement, that i s well controlled by the players, just like the short shelf -life, mentioned by Francas (2018 ) and Rossetti et al . (2011) , is a characteristic of the product tha t demands a better stock control and in some cases higher investment on transportation (air transport rather than shipment, fo r example), being mo re a management issue and less a technical one. Another impor tant care for logistics is about humidity , as poi nted out by Rossetti et al. (2011 ). However, during the research, the issue mentioned about humidity was about moisture and not allow the package to get wet, otherwise it may damage it or er ase printed information like shelf -life, so usually there is no specific control of the air humidity.", "When que stioned about what could impact the quality of biological drugs during the storage, some interviewees said that it will also d epends on the specif ic product we are talking about.

Cost was also important fo r R&D, due the huge investments of money and t ime necessary to develop new products.", "As it was mentioned in one of the interviews, quality is imperative in biopharmaceutical se ctor. So, challenges related to i t were mentioned by different players, usually with high rate of impact on the business. It i s also important to mention that even in challeng es classifie d in the “supply network ” dimension, in some of them there were also a relation to quality, for example the availability of specialized suppliers (that is a challenge related to the supply networ k, that shows a worry about the quality of the se rvice provid ed). Logistics providers also realize this importance, seeing quality with high impact on their business, recognizing it is a qualifying factor, what means that it is imperative to be on this market.", "Supply net work was also a general concern, confirming th e statement that the ecosystem of biopharmaceuticals is still under d evelopment in Brazil. Raw materials and machinery still need to be imported and specialized 3PLs (for warehousing and", "transpor tation) is critical for this market.

It is still different when w e are talking about government companies and privat e companies. Those managed by Brazilian government must follow specific reg ulations (that will be more explored in a specific topic), so their processes are less flexible, for example , purchasing materials , hiring services and people, advertising, everything is slower and have strict er norms.", "The topics brought by those in the u niversity were very interest ing. Despite all of them have a t echnical background (as a researcher), most had experience as manager , so the perspectives were not only focused on technology and cos t (as happened with those on R&D), but they also could see cr itical challenges on logisti cs and on the supply network. Bes ides, they also feel how the gaps on the biopharmaceutical ecosystem can affect all participants, for example the lack of national raw material suppl ier and how the lack of a more specific regula tion can make the process of approval of a biopharmaceutical (new, biobetter or biosimilar) take much longer time in Brazil if com pared to Europe, for example, and how it can affect the development of this sect or in this country.", "So, the results presented in this topic aimed to show that different stages of the supp ly chain have a convergent perspective about what dimensions impact t he sector as a whole but depending on the business of each participant of the su pply chain, the importance of each challenge may be different.

Due the sensitivity of the product, the impact on patients’ health and its price, the chain can’t fail", "in any point or the losses will be huge. Hence , logistics suppliers be come key players in this supply chain , as pointed out by Feifei et al. (2013) .", "All the interviewees said that their compan ies (producers and distributors) hire logistics service providers. The most commo n is outsource transportation service, but a few players in this sector also hire a company to manage thei r DC, while others prefer to do this activity in order to keep a bett er control on these centers , for being strategic . The main reason to outsource tr ansportation was the expertise of the third p arty suppliers (this is a very specialized service), cost red uction (the volume of each producer or distributor is not so high, so 3PLs can scale up and make it cheaper), besides , the supplier takes the responsi bility for the quality assurance of this sta ge o f the supply chain, spreading risks. This perception is aligned with the literature, in which we could see cost reduction , service improvements and focus on core competencie s as the main reason to outsource a logistics service (Maloni & When questioned about risk of 3PLs , quality was an important issue to worry. For being expensive services, prioritize cost over quality can b e a trap for the hiring company due to the lo sses that a failure in these services can generate. Losing th e full control over the process also is a worry for some interviewees . For example, on one hand it is good that 3PLs consolidate the demand from diffe rent companies and have gains of scales; on the other hand, the hiring company loses part of the control a bout timing and itinerary. Of course, one of the risks is creating de pendence of this partner, but it is not necessarily a big trouble. An interesting strategy observed on the market is having two logistics partners. The n umber of suppliers is a parameter to assess the supply risk of a company (Kraljic, 1983) , so having just one partn er raises risk, for depending on a single supplier . However, keeping a small number of partners (two or three, for instance) allows not only to choose good service providers , but also to keep a close partnership , building a trust relationship with them, hence even improv ing the service pro vided, correcting imperfections on the processes and overcoming unexp ected situations. This strategy is aligned with Feifei et al. (2013) findings, which state that close relationship with contractors is a fundamental aspect in biopharmaceutical sector. However , this strategy of having few suppliers can be not possible for a ll participants of the supply chain because, for example, some distributors need capillarity to cover as m uch part of Brazilian territory (that is very big) as possible, so lo oking for regional suppliers may be necessary, what doesn’t invalid ate the import ance of a close and trustworthy relationship with them.", "4.2 PERSPECTIVES OF THE SECTOR", "4.2.1. Brazilian regulation p erception", "Overall perspective about regulation in Brazil was very sim ilar. ANVISA ’s norms are aligned with EMA’s legislation and WHO’s guidelines that are considered world’s benchmark. The norms are very strict (in a good sense), but every process that dep ends on th e regulation agency is very slow, and it is very bad for th e development of the sector in the country. In some cases, the approval for a new medicine can last years, what creates a very unattractive environment for a company to invest in producti on in this country. One of the interviewees mentioned that not only t he political instability of the last years, but also currency variation and even changes in the government incentives also bri ng uncertainty for companies that are planning to invest in B razil.", "Whe n we are talking about the regulation in the supply chain a s a whole, ANVISA is also seen as an effective agency in most part of the SC, but having some difficult in the inspection of t he last distributors in some cases, especially the smallest, what can h arm all the work made until that point. However, one of the interviewees pointed out that the norm RDC 304/ 2019 , published by ANVISA in Sep tember 2019, stablish ing good practices for distribution, storage and transportation of medicines , can be very helpful for the regulation agency make this supervision. This no rm focuses on quality management requests that companies must follow.", "The attempt of Brazilian government to develop the bioph arma ceutical sector through the PDPs in general has been seen as an important incentive to develop technology in this country. Acc ording to a n interviewee from the public sector, the planning of the program is to internalize the develo pment knowledge step by step, first doing the final production stages, to have tim e to train people and build proper plants, and later be able to produ ce the API (the most complex stage). However, the PDPs’ program by itself is not enough to develop this s ector. An interviewee highlighted that there are other parts of Brazilian ecosyste m that need to be developed , like machinery and biological raw materi al suppliers. Due this uncertain environment, with an ecosystem not fully develop ed, Brazil still struggles to stop being a go od “copier” of pharmaceutical processes (like it happens with the", "generics) to become a developer of top technology, always depend ing on this kind of government influence, like PDPs, to become an attractive plac e for multination al companies, despite of its market potential.", "4.2.2. Other s trategic issues", "During this explora tory study, other strategic issues (different from those previously approached) for this supply chain players could be gathered during the interviews. The most relevant of them were chosen to be discussed at this topic.", "Aiming to understand the dynamic of the sector and the most important issues for the players , it was questioned durin g the interviews what are the key issues on the decision to go to a c ertain market and what is considered to implement an operation in a specific country or region (in the cas e of expansion in Brazilian territory).", "The current structure of most pro ducers is centralizing it in a few places, specially Europe and USA, for bei ng close from research centers and raw material su ppliers (some of them are also biological products and n eed the same storage conditions of the medicines) and for those places be where the plants are already installed, so they already have a well- develope d supply chain (with good multimodal logistics structure and specialized suppliers) to distribute the prod ucts and expanding the existing network allow s them to achieve economies o f scale and improve their efficiency.", "Those areas are also where the bigges t markets are , so being close from the final consu mer reduce risks and costs , what are also impacted by their political -economic stability . Specialized workforce was also mentioned , because this sector requires a totally different training from synthetic m edicines, being a valuable resource that is not so easy to find. This perspective is consistent with Brajcich et al. (2016) , who studie d US pharmaceutical sector , but they highlighted the c omplexity o f transferring this kind of technology to other countries and that government incentives is also a factor for manuf acturers implement their operations in th e US . In our research it could be s eeing tax incentives were key decision point for d istributors to decide in which state implement a distrib ution center. Brazil ian taxation is complex, and some state taxes can be h igh enough to , when considered the high value of biological medicines, be wo rthy to implement an operation on a place differen t from the sweet spot of the logistics perspective .", "4.2.3. Futu re of the sector", "The analysis of the f uture of biological drugs was focuse d on three main perspectives: expansion, production and new ways to distribu te those medicines. As it was expected, when we were talking about the future of the sector, different poi nts of vie w emerged, so here we will try to consolidate them and bring a p erspective aligned with all the information gathered on the study.", "As it was said before, biopharmaceutical sector has grown i n developed countries, due the expansion of biosimilars and investments to develop new biological medicines (Harrington, 2018 ; Otto, Alberto, & Schrader, 2014 ; ResearchAndMarkets, 2018) . However, in the perception of most interviewees, in Brazil we still can’t see this expansion of biosimilar products as a real ity. It is expected to happen in the next few year s. PDPs’ program is trying to accelerate it, encouraging national p roduction , aiming to reduce government costs with those medicin es, allowing a bigger part of Brazilian population to have access to those treatments. For example, Biomanguinhos (a governmen t laboratory) is investing in new plants to achieve PDPs ’ program goal of a national production, absorbing this new technology. One interviewee brought the information that some countries like Brazil, China , India, Mexico and Japan, are investing to develo p the biopharmaceutical sector internally , what was alig ned with BioPlan Associates (2018) research, that gathered the mai n countries where 222 companies had facilities . It was a lso brought the perspective that in the coming future, we may see just a s mall decentralization up to a point that make sense, considering being close from markets, like Asia and South America, that a re big enough to allow economies of scale and logistics cost reduction (due smaller distance and risks for transportation). So , we can infer that regional poles may be emerging, espec ially pulled by the expansion of biosimilars.", "Rossetti et al. (2011) saw as a trend in the pharmaceutical supply ch ain its fragment ation in three major product types: OTC and generics ; brand name drugs and therapeutics ; and cold -chain. It is a s imilar point of view of one of our interviewees, to what he called specializ ation. He believes that companies tend to focus th eir operations in biologicals or synthetic medicines. Th at kind of strategy probably would generate spinoffs, creating d ifferent b rands under the same holding.", "An interes ting point raised i n this study is a bout the need of economies of scale in the biophar mace utical sector. It is true that biological drugs dema nd complex structure in terms of technology (Gurǎu, 2004) , producti on and distribution (Otto, Alberto, & Schrader, 2014 ; Rodrigues et al., 2018) and scale and continuous pro duction are important factors to reduce costs. However, the emerging of single -use technologies (SUT) can bring the flexibility and cost reduc tion that allows small manufacturers to be competitive. Lopes (2015) adds reduced capital investment, increased speed (fast construction) and safety to the list of features brought by this new technology that improve the producer competitiveness . So, this technology also may contribute to the capability of emerging countri es develop their own production, since scale may not be so crucial for competition in the future.", "As it was said bef ore, biobetters can bring more stability for the structure of the reference biological drugs, making possible to administrate it in different ways, such as oral, dermatological and inhaled . That not only brings more comfort to patients but m ay generate a big impact on the supply chain. Most interviewees agree that the way that biological medicines will be distributed tends to change with the advance of those researches . In cases that patients are able to administrate the medicines by themselves, the trend i s that they take those medicines at home, instead of going to hospitals and medical centers every time they need to administrate it. That brings two consequences: 1) new distribution channels, like direct shipping, may expand ; and 2) patients must be train ed on how to store those medicines, otherwise it may harm drugs’ efficacy , both also were part of the research of Rossetti et al. (2011) . That brings another challenge: how to control the quality of biological medicines after they are held by patients? Some companies already have specific phone num ber for this kind of advisory, but actual control is more difficult. This kind of training and orientation for patients is a trend that takes biopharmaceutical producers and distributors to move a little bit more to the servi tization process .", "The possibili ty of direct shipment may bring new possibilities in the market. One interviewee talked about the raising of companies specialized in this kind of delivery service, and it is very similar to the business of the company where another person interviewed work s: a startup that administrate s vaccines wherever the patient is. As it was said before, despite not being the focus of the study, vaccines are also a kind of biopharmaceutical, hence demanding the same kind of temperature co ntrol, what makes it a good source for comparison when we are talking about logistics.", "4.3 Contributions to the literature As it was said before, there is a very limited number of academical studies around the biological medicines supply chain.

The different sources bring temperature control as the main challenge for logistics in this supply chain, we still highlight the importance of the", "end-to-end control in this process and that, in Brazil, specialists say that the last stage of distributi on is the most critical one, where flaws may happen.", "For developing countries, this research still brings some perspectives about what is important t o develop the biopharmaceutical sector. The trend is that most part of R&D and production of the new biological drugs stay in Europe and USA, but it is possible to have a small decentralization to a few countries to be closer from big markets due to logist ics cost. So, good regulation (strict and agile), political and economic stability, as well as tax incentives have shown to be factors that impact on the investment decision in this sector . Availability of qualified workforce and specialized 3PLs providers are factors necessary to install a biopharmaceutical industry. The entire ecosystem must be ready. Despite not being present in many articles , academics , non-academic and the interviewees agree that the way that biological drugs will arrive to final cons umers is changing, so companies must adapt. Researchers are developing new (easier) ways to administr ate those medicines, so patients don’t have to go to hospitals to take it. So, new channels to deliver biopharmaceuticals may raise and a servitization pro cess to, for example, orient patients about how to proper store those medicines will also be necessar y. Production also may have a few changes that can generate opportunities. The use of single -use technologies can give the necessary flexibility, so econom ies of scale may not be a necessary condition anymore , and medium -size production plants can become economically viable. As it was mentioned before, biosimilars are already showing an expansion in developed countries, but it is still an expectation in Braz il. So, obse rving all the factors brought in this study is important to understand critical points that need to be improved, in order to create a favorable environment to the development of biopharmaceutical sector and the return on the investments made by Brazilian g overnment with the PDPs be positive, accor ding to the expected.", "5. CONCLUSION", "Most part of the researches about biological medicines focus on technical issues and just a few approach businesses issues. This research aimed to fulfill part of this gap, studyi ng the biopharmaceutical supply chain and the critical factors for Brazil to develop this sector, especially due the fact of the expiration of the patents of important biological medicines and,", "consequently, a growth in the number of biosim ilars, what can generate an expansion of the demand for those medicines.", "The new biological medicines are a complex kind of drugs to be produced and can generate good results for treatments of diseases that chemical drugs couldn’t show good efficacy, what makes those bio pharmaceuticals very expensive products. In Brazilian reality, the main buyer is the government, what means that the advance of biosimilars can reduce the annual expenses and make those medicines accessible for more people. However, it is necessary to make those medicines arrive to patients and for that, a specialized supply chain is necessary due the storage condition that biopharmaceuticals must be kept. Understanding biopharmaceutical supply chain and the most important challenges that mu st be overcome i n order to develop biopharmaceutical sector were the main motivators of this research. To look for the answers, an exploratory study was made, interviewing ten senior professionals with experience in the biopharmaceutical sector.", "The resul ts indicate that the main logistics challenge for the biopharmaceuticals is the temperature control. Humidity is also a worry, but smaller. Other factors will depend on each medicine. However, the big challenge raised in the research is the end -to-end temp erature control through all the supply chain, that because any failure in any point of the supply chain put in risk all the work done until that point, resulting in losses of a very expensive product, or worse, because if the failure is not detected, it wil l harm the effic iency of the patient’s treatment.", "Another important finding of this research for many companies in this supply chain is the relation to the patients. Most of the biological medicines need to be administrated in clinics and hospitals, but re searches have be en done to produce more stable molecular structures, which can be administrated in easier ways (like oral), hence patients can use it at their own home. Due to these facts, new channels to deliver the biological drugs to patients will be cr eated and this f inal consumer will have to be trained in how to proper store those medicines at home, so the efficacy is not harmed. Hence, companies will have to be able to attend those new demand, especially if, due to the expansion of biosimilars, more peop le have access to this kind of medicine.", "Brazilian government has done efforts to develop the biopharmaceutical sector in this country. PDPs program aimed to develop the sector giving a guarantee of purchasing", "determined medicine, while the private com pany should tran sfer the technology for a Brazilian company (invested by the government). However, this program alone is not enough to develop the whole sector; there must be adequate logistics structure, as well as skilled workforce and reliable suppliers . In other words , the ecosystem as a whole must be developed, and quality is mandatory in this sector. Taxation and political and economic stability are also important aspects that Brazilian government should improve for the development of the sector, beca use they are fac tors analyzed in the decision of a company’s choice about where to implement an operation.", "This research also aimed to bring the different perspectives of each participants of the supply chain and raise what are the critical challenges for each of them an d classified them into a list of proposed dimensions (Political, Economic, Social, Technological, Environmental, Legal/ Regulatory, Cost, Customer Relationship, Logistics, Supply Network, Quality). As a general rule, we can say that quality is imperative t hrough all the supply chain, due the sensibility of the product and the high value. Supply chain network was also a general concern, because it is important to have a good control end -to-end in the supply chain, because any failure can harm the work done b y all the participants in the chain. However, it was found also some characteristics of companies from specific stages of the supply chain. For example, manufacturers have a broad perspective, because they must be worried about the raw mate rial, 3PLs and t hey are also the brand of the medicine, so they also must be worried about the final consumer (patients) and the relationship with them. Third party logistics suppliers already understood that quality is mandatory in the biopharmaceutical s ector, so they m ust keep it as a priority to be able to be the suppliers of big companies. Distributors are also in a complicated position, because keep cost low is important to be profitable, but, as it was mentioned before, quality is mandatory through all this supply ch ain and the must face the logistics challenges. Charts were plotted to allow the interpretation of the challenges of different stages of the biopharmaceutical supply chain.", "The biopharmaceutical sector is very important because of the impa ct it can causes in the life of millions of people around the world. So, this was a preliminary study, that aimed to raise important factors to develop this sector and that were not found in the literature. Future studies can investigate deeply each one of the aspects rai sed at this research or even explore stages of the supply chain that were not the focus here, for example what is the Brazilian capacity to produce the biological raw material necessary to produce the medicines? Another suggestion is to use the challenges raised and ask interviewees to rate all of them in the", "proposed parameters. In this study it was not possible to return to the interviewees to rate all of the challenges listed, so they analyzed just the ones each of them proposed. Besides, it has been a s ector with dynamic environment in the past few years and now it is possible to develop biopharmaceuticals for a specific individual. So, what are the applications of those medicines? How big is this market? Is that viable now? Those questio ns can be addres sed for this next generation of biologics.", "6.

Their extended structure is generally formed by the condensation reaction of their building blocks. This organized reticular structure allows the formation of nanopores, which allow the application of this type of material mainly in: gas capture and storage, heterogeneous catalysis, and optoelectronics. In this study, microporous COFs RIO-11, RIO-12 and RIO-13 were prepared by the condensation reaction between hydrazine hydrate and hydroxy-1,3,5-triformylbenzenes. The latter was chosen due to the inexpensive cost of the phenol substrates. For these materials, the inﬂuence of intramolecular hydrogen bonding on their crystallinity, which was attributed to the eﬀects of conformational locks, was investigated. Additionally, the use of aniline as a modulator has also been studied and proved to be beneﬁcial if the number of conformational locks is insuﬃcient to provide high crystallinity. Furthermore, a variety of COFs, besides of those cited above, have been thoroughly studied by Small-Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS). Among the main results, it can be highlighted that for the microporous COFs, quantitative surface roughness values were obtained as a function of the fractal parameters, unanimously indicating surface fractals. Mesoporous COFs showed mostly surface fractals for the extended structure and mass fractals for the pores, when a hierarchical structure was detected. In addition to these studies, the application of the synthesized COFs was also investigated. RIO-11, RIO-12 and RIO-13 were employed in CO 2capture. Due to the microporous nature of these COFs and to their heteroatom-containing framework, they are suitable candidates for this application. RIO-13, which presented the higher CO 2 uptake among these materials, showed excellent recyclability, retaining its adsorption property up to three cycles. Furthermore, RIO-12 was employed in the synthesis of the heterogeneous catalyst NiCl@RIO-12. This material showed catalytic activity in cross- coupling Suzuki-Miyaura reactions under microwave radiation. Despite its moderate yields, it was more active than its homogeneous counterpart, it showed good recyclability and no leaching was detected. These characteristics demonstrate the robustness of COFs as heterogeneous catalysts platforms and in gas capture applications. Finally, the use of amino acids as COFs building blocks was explored in this study. Aiming at preparing bioinspired materials based on the design of biological polymeric structures, glycine, L- valine, L-alanine and L-phenylalanine were used as starting materials for amino acid-based COF construction. Although the structure characterization of the ﬁnal product is yet inconclusive, the synthesis and characterization of such COF materials were investigated.

Beginning...", "Reticular chemistry can be deﬁned as the science that studies the assemble of predesigned building blocks into predetermined extended structures, which are intrinsically connected by strong bonding (YAGHI et al., 2003). In 2005, this ﬁeld of chemistry was on the spotlight: the remarkable study of Omar Yaghi was published in Science(CÔTÉ et al., 2005), describing extended materials that are fully organic, porous, crystalline and with surface areas over 700 m2/g. Until now, the aforementioned paper holds up more than 2,600 citations – and counting.", "This study deﬂated the idea that the microscopic reversibility, regarding the crystallization of covalently bonded organic molecules, is diﬃcult – if not impossible – to attain. The construction of a solid material based only on light elements that is simultaneously crystalline, purely organic, porous and with high surface area was then coined as a Covalent Organic Framework (COF). The low density and ordered COF, with its peculiar textural properties, became obviously a benchmark for potential applications in gas storage, optoelectronics and in heterogeneous catalysis.", "Through this publication (CÔTÉ et al., 2005), the authors related the synthesis of COF-1 and COF-5, both based on the dehydration of boronic acids. COF-1 (Figure 1) was prepared from the building block diboronic acid (BDBA). The resulting material is covalently linked by the B 3O3six-membered boroxine- likerings, that are formed from the elimination of water molecules. Likewise, COF-5 (Figure 2) was synthesized from the building blocks BDBA and 2,3,6,7,10,11-hexahydroxytriphenylene (HHTP), whereas the extended structure is connected by BO 2C2ﬁve-membered boronate ester rings. These COFs were prepared in solvothermal conditions, that is, performed in a high pressure vessel with a non-aqueous solvent. Thus, the combination of the respective building blocks in a mesytilene-dioxane solution for 72 h at 120 °C in a sealed Pyrex tube, allowed the formation of COF-1 and COF-5. The moderate solubility of the building blocks in the reaction solvent is an important factor: this allows the control of the reagents diﬀusion into solution, whereas a more diluted system eases the nucleation of a crystalline material. Additionally, the closed reaction system grants the availability of water molecules, which sustains the reversibility of the reaction.", "The elucidation of the chemical structure of COF-1 and COF-5 was performed by 11B solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and infrared spectroscopy.

Due to the planar nature of the starting building blocks, the 2D covalently bonded sheets stack by π-π interactions in a layered material, with detected interlayer distance in the 3 Å level which is comparable to the one of graphite (BERNAL, 1924). Additionally, thermogravimetric analysis showed no decomposition up to 600 °C for both COFs, demonstrating the thermal robustness of these materials. The surface area and pore size distribution were accessed by N 2adsorption-desorption measurements, applying the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) (BRUNAUER; EMMETT; TELLER, 1938) and density functional theory (DFT) models (RAVIKOVITCH et al., 2000), respectively. COF-1 presented BET surface area (S BET) of 711 m2/g and pore size mainly distributed between 6 Å and 12 Å. While for COF-5, the SBETwas 1590 m2/g and the pore size distribution indicated mainly pore size of 27 Å. Chapter 1. Introduction 28 This seminal publication represented a major chemical innovation in the early 21st century, rising interest of many scientists based on the possibility of creating crystalline and porous materials solely by light atoms. This granted the possibility of exploring a myriad of design possibilities of COFs based on the premises of organic synthesis. Naturally, the tunability of the material is of most importance to the desired application. As such, theoretically, a perfect match between a COF and its applicability can be done by drawing structure-application relationships in order to enhance the design of the desired COF. Still, designing such materials is not a trivial task, factors as: obtaining highly crystalline materials, easy and inexpensive availability of building blocks and ﬁnding the ideal reaction conditions are among main topics of COFs research.", "1.2 The “Crystallization Problem”", "When reacting multipodal organic building blocks in order to obtain an extended structure, it is plausible to assume at ﬁrst that the resulting material will not have an ordered structure. For example, due to the known stability of most covalent bonds, amorphous cross-linked polymers can be easily obtained by reacting the starting mate- rials through Friedel-Crafts alkylation, Ullmann and Buchwald couplings, to cite a few (DAWSON; COOPER; ADAMS, 2012; WALLER; GÁNDARA; YAGHI, 2015). However, designing crystalline covalent extended structures, with the same precision as it is done for small molecules, is diﬃcult mostly due to the one-step synthesis that aﬀords an insoluble product. Thus, the “crystallization problem” usually addresses the challenge of ﬁnding reaction conditions that allows linking molecular building blocks by strong covalent bonds, challenge which usually increases with the strength of the bonds in question (Figure 3). Thus, the reaction must occur in a reversible fashion that allows “error-checking” and promotes the self-correction of defects. For example, it is usually simple to make crystals that are held together by weak interactions, such as dry ice (CO 2 (s)) and ice (H 2O(s)), however, it is substantially more diﬃcult to crystallize structures in which metal to charged ligand bonds and non-metal to non-metal bonds are employed (JIANG; ZHAO; YAGHI, Thus, COF synthesis must be carried out under the Dynamic Covalent Chemistry (DCC) principles, whereas the reaction is submitted to equilibrium control conditions, allowing the reversibility of the reaction to self-correct the defects of the material. Taking into account that the product formation occurs under thermodynamic control, the distri- bution of the products rely solely on the relative stability of the ﬁnal products ( ∆G◦ Band ∆G◦ C) and not on the free energy diﬀerences of the transition states ( ∆G‡ Band∆G‡ C), as it occurs for kinetically controlled reactions (ROWAN et al., 2002), as shown in Figure 4. For the example in Figure 4, a reaction over kinetic control results in irreversible Chapter 1. Introduction 29 Figure 3: Stronger bond energies between the molecular building blocks lead to a more diﬃcult crystallization of the extended structure. Reprinted with permission from J. Am. Chem.

Figure 4: Free energy diagram for a chemical reaction in equilibrium: thermodynamic versuskinectic control over product distribution.", "Chapter 1. Introduction 30 formation of strong covalent bonds, whereas the reagent Atends to form mainly product C. Once the product is formed, it is not possible for the latter to regenerate the starting material under the reaction conditions. However, if a reaction is under thermodynamic control, the covalent bonds have the ability to be formed and broken reversibily. If this process occurs in a reasonable time frame, this dynamic covalent chemistry allows the predominant formation of the most stable product B. Furthermore, for this reaction to progress in the direction of the products, the change in the ∆G◦ Rof the reaction must be negative (Equation 1.1), and factors as temperature, pressure and concentration, must be controlled, as they also aﬀect the equilibrium of the reaction (ROWAN et al., 2002). ∆G◦ R= ∆H◦ R−T∆S◦ R=−RTlnKeq (1.1) In MOF chemistry, this challenge has been overcome by substantially slowing down the formation of strong metal-oxygen covalent bonds between the inorganic and organic building blocks in a rate that permits the self-correction. In a general manner, the synthesis of a MOF involves the deprotonation of an organic acid, breaking an O-H bond in order to form a M-O bond, as shown in Figure 5 for the preparation of MOF UiO-66 from terephthalic acid (TPA) and zirconium tetrachloride (CAVKA et al., 2008): Figure 5: Synthesis of MOF UiO-66 from terephthalic acid (TPA) and zirconium tetra- chloride.", "The use of amide solvents, as N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), is key. Under heating, DMF goes under thermal degradation to give carbon monoxide and dimethylamine. The slow release of the latter grants moderately deprotonation of the carboxylic acid and eases the linkage formation between the oxygen atom and the metal (JUILLARD, 1977). This methodology has been widely used in MOF chemistry, resulting in single crystals in the millimiter scale (JIANG; ZHAO; YAGHI, 2016).", "Another strategy to aﬀord highly crystalline MOFs is the use of modulators: the addition of ligands with only one coordinating site, which compete with the multipodal linkers for coordination to the metal atom. Still taking UiO-66 as an example, Schaate et al.reported that the addition of benzoic acid along with the building block TPA, lead to a mean crystallite size increase from 85 nm to over 120 nm. The growth of larger crystals is attributed to the in situformation of complexes between the zirconium cations and Chapter 1. Introduction 31 the modulator (benzoic acid). The growth of the framework then proceeds through an exchange of the modulator by the TPA at the coordinating sites of the zirconium ion. Thus, an increasing number of the modulator would avoid the possibility of the TPA being connected to the metal site at ﬁrst, avoiding the formation of several framework nuclei. The prior complexation of the zirconium with the modulator, and the slow ligand exchange, favors the slow and fewer formation of the framework nuclei, resulting in the growth of larger crystals (SCHAATE et al., 2011).", "Figure6:SynthesisofCOF-5employingthemodulatorapproach.Reprintedwithpermission fromJ. Am. Chem. Soc. 2016, 138, 4, 1234-1239. Copyright 2015 American Chemical Society, https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jacs.5b10708.", "Regarding COFs, a typical approach for when condensation reactions are involved is the control of water in the reaction system. The control over this byproduct can be achieved because the reaction occurs in a closed system and proceeds with a combination of hydrophilic (dioxane) and hydrophobic (mesitylene) solvents. The empty space in the reaction vessel allows the water to be partitioned between the reaction mixture and the headspace, modulating the extent of the equilibrium according to the Le Châtelier principle. Additionally, acidic catalysts, such as acetic acid, are usually employed to increase the rate of formation/cleavage of the covalent bonds in question (JIANG; ZHAO; YAGHI, 2016). Chapter 1. Introduction 32 Besides inﬂuencing the position of the equilibrium by regulating the amount of water in the system, the modulator approach reported for MOFs has also been applied to COFs. Calik et al.reported the use of monoboronic acid as a modulator (Figure 6) in the synthesis of COF-5 (CALIK et al., 2016). The modulator strategy for the COF-5 growth was described as acting as a capping agent, whereas it terminates the 2D sheets during lateral growth. By constantly forming and breaking bonds in the reversible dehydration reaction, the COF-5 crystals go through several steps of precipitation and redissolution that facilitate the healing of defects and brings the system closer to the thermodynamic equilibrium. Additionally, the modulator could possibly saturate point defects, such as partially unreacted building blocks. As a consequence, the crystal strain is reduced and a more stable crystal conformation is achieved, leading to the formation of larger and higher crystalline COF domains through Ostwald ripening. The authors also investigated the inﬂuence of diﬀerent amounts of the modulator, whereas a further increase of the modulator content above 10%, in a molar ratio basis, led to a gradual decrease of the surface area. The modulator strategy resulted in a material with BET surface area of 2100 m2/g, an increase of 32% when compared to the modulator-free one reported in the literature (1590 m2/g) (CÔTÉ et al., 2005).", "Further applying this successful modulator strategy for COFs, Yaghi’s group managed to obtain single crystals of COF-300 which were suitable to X-ray diﬀrac- tion characterization (MA et al., 2018a). Prepared by the condensation of tetrakis-(4- aminophenyl)methane (TAPM) with terephthalaldehyde (TPAL) (Figure 7), COF-300 is a material covalently bonded in three dimensions with a interpenetrated diamond- like structure, which was obtained previously as a polycrystalline solid and was not suitable for single crystal diﬀraction (URIBE-ROMO et al., 2009). In this recent approach (MA et al., 2018a), aniline was used as a modulator in order to increase the reversibility of imine bond formation by means of the imine-exchange strategy (VITAKU; DICHTEL, 2017). Aniline was chosen due to the comparable reactivity to the tetrapodal building block TAPM and because it is more susceptible to nucleophilic attack by amines rather then by water (CORDES; JENCKS, 1962). Notably, COF-300 crystals of 10 µm to 60µm were successfully obtained (Figure 8).", "Based on fruitful methodologies towards overcoming the “crystallization problem”, the next logical step was to explore a diversity of new linkages in order to evaluate possible design-directed applications. The emergence of these new linkages took the framework design to another level, enhancing the possibilities of creating new COFs with diverse chemical structures (DEBLASE; DICHTEL, 2016).", "Chapter 1.

The resulting material showed a 2D interlayer gap of 3.7 Å, in which the authors described as an ideal scaﬀold for incorporating metal ions. Palladium was then bonded to the framework by post-synthetic modiﬁcation (PSM), where the prepared COF-LZU1 was reacted with palladium acetate in dichloromethane at room temperature for 24 h (Figure 9, bottom), aﬀording a palladium content of 7.13 wt.%. The catalytic activity of Pd/COF-LZU1 catalyst was then evaluated in Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling reactions of aryl boronic acid and a variety of aryl halides. The reaction products were obtained in excellent yields (96-98%) when employing 0.5 mol% of Pd/COF-LZU1 as a catalyst, which was recyclable up to 4 cycles without signiﬁcant loss of catalytic activity.", "Following this trend, Gonçalves et al.coordinated palladium in the walls of the imine-based COF-300 (GONÇALVES et al., 2016) under similar conditions as described by Wang (DING et al., 2011).

The ILCOF-1 showed moderate gas uptake capacity in general when low pressure conditions were employed, which was attributed to the mesoporous nature of the material. Conversely, high-pressure adsorption experiments showed gas uptake of 4.7 wt.% (77 K and 40 bar) for H 2, which is higher than most of the organic polymers of similar speciﬁc surface area (DAWSON; COOPER; ADAMS, 2012).

The ﬁrst was the pioneer to describe a COF with hydrazone linkages, reporting the facile synthesis of the crystalline mesoporous COF-43 (URIBE-ROMO et al., 2011). Based on the condensation of 2,5-diethoxyterephthalohydrazide and 1,3,5- tris(4-formylphenyl)benzene in a typical solvothermal methodology (Figure 11), COF-43 presented S BETof 620 m2/g when the argon adsorption-desorption type IV isotherm was evaluated. The pore size and total pore volume attributed to the material were 38 Å and 0.36 cm3/g, respectively, and it presented good thermal stability up to 280 °C. Driven by the potential application of 2D COFs as nanoporous membranes, litho- graphic templates and photocurrent generators, Bunck & Dichtel investigated COF-43 exfoliation to aﬀord few- and single layer materials (BUNCK; DICHTEL, 2013). This hydrazone-linked COF was exfoliated simply by immersion of the material in dioxane for 2 hours. The relatively weak interactions of the 2D layered sheets were disturbed and showed an apparent loss of COF-43 crystallinity by PXRD, despite no changes in its covalent bonds, which were veriﬁed by solid-state NMR and in situFTIR. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) indicated that the exfoliated samples had average heights of 1.32 nm that corresponds to 3-5 layers, while the pristine ones showed average heights of 200 nm. Additionally, selected area electron diﬀraction (SAED) showed an hexagonal diﬀraction pattern, an indication that the order at the nanometer scale of COF-43 was preserved in the exfoliated sheets. Despite the context of the possible applications, this discovery was relevant due to its demonstration that exposure to an exfoliating solvent can obfuscate the crystallinity of a COF, which is usually evaluated by PXRD.", "Chapter 1.

The hydrazone- based COF was prepared from 4,4’,4”-(1,3,5-triazine-2,4,6-triyl)tribenzaldehyde (TFPT, Figure 12a) and 2,5-diethoxy-terephthalohydrazide building blocks under acidic conditions, aﬀording a mesoporous COF with pore size of 3.8 nm, S BETof 1603 m2/g and total pore volume of 1.03 cm3/g. Triggered by previous studies of Pt-modiﬁed triazine-based carbon nitride as a potential photocatalyst (SCHWINGHAMMER et al., 2013), TFPT–COF, bearing a moderate band gap of 2.8 eV, presented itself as an excellent candidate towards this application. Indeed, the total amount of hydrogen produced after 52 h surpassed the total amount of hydrogen that exists within the material, which indicated that hydrogen evolution is thus catalytic and does not result from stoichiometric decomposition of the TFPT–COF. Moreover, experiments in the dark showed no hydrogen evolution, attesting that the hydrogen evolution is a photoinduced eﬀect. Interestingly, after the photocatalysis the material presented itself amorphous in PXRD measurements. However, inﬂuenced by the studies of Bunck et al.(BUNCK; DICHTEL, 2013), TEM experiments suggested that the material lost its long-range order during photocatalysis due to the exfoliation of TFPT–COF in water. Overall, this study showed the development of COFs as tunable scaﬀolds for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. This bottom-up approach toward designing a tailor-made heterogeneous photocatalyst is very interesting when one considers the use of COFs for optoelectronic applications.", "Azine COFs are characterized by the presence of -C=N-N=C- bonds, which are usually formed from condensation of hydrazine (NH 2NH2) and aldehydes in COF chemistry.

TheaﬀordingCOFs,withthecentralringofphenyl(N 0-COF),pyridyl(N 1-COF),pyrimidyl (N2-COF) and triazine (N 3-COF), were evaluated towards hydrogen evolution. All COFs demonstrated evolution of hydrogen within 8h, with an interesting fourfold increase along with each substitution of C–H by N in the triphenylaryl plataform. Although the authors refrain from pinpointing this single nitrogen substitution as the sole reason for the aforementioned results, they stated that a complex interplay of several factors, such as changes in textural properties, could also inﬂuence the photocatalytic activity. Considering these conclusions, the authors showed that engineering the building blocks can enhance the electronic properties of these photofunctional COFs, highlighting the designability of COF materials as a powerful tool in potential applications.", "Regarding the gas storage properties of azine COFs, Li et al.reported the syn- thesis of the azine-based COF-JLU2 based on the building blocks hydrazine and 1,3,5- triformylphloroglucinol (LI et al., 2015). This microporous material was reported with S BET of 415 m2/g, pore size of 9.6 Å and pore volume of 0.56 cm3/g. Based on its microporous characteristics and abundant nitrogen content on the pore wall, COF-JLU2 was studied for its gas adsorption properties of methane, hydrogen and carbon dioxide. For CO 2 adsorption, COF-JLU2 presented uptake capacity of 21.7 wt% at 273 K and 1 bar. This high uptake capacity was attributed to the inherent microporosity of framework and to the signiﬁcant content of nitrogen and oxygen in COF- JLU2, which can produce strong dipole-quadrupole interaction. Hydrogen and methane adsorption were investigated due to their potential as alternative fuels for green energy applications. The uptake capacity for H2and CH 4was 1.6 wt% 3.8 wt.%, respectively. As though these values are not as high as the values for the CO 2adsorption, they were comparable with the ones reported for Chapter 1.

COF-JLU2 was reproduced with similar reaction conditions under the name of ATFG-COF. Aware of the possible existence of the two tautomeric forms, denominated NH form for the β-ketoenamine tautomer and OH form for the enol-hydrazone, a thorough solid state NMR study was employed and compared with the theoretical calculations of the chemical shifts.15N CP-MAS solid-state NMR (Figure 13b) clearly showed that both tautomeric forms exist in ATFG-COF: the presence of the experimental values of -202 ppm (C=C- N, NH form) and -92 ppm (C= N-N, OH form) were in agreement with the calculated values of -197 ppm and -95.5 ppm, respectively (Figure 13a). Additionally,13C CP-MAS NMR analysis also conﬁrmed the coexistence of the tautomers, with evidence of the keto carbon in 182 ppm and 163 ppm for the enol carbon which were also in agreement with the theoretical values when assuming a 1:1 contribution of both tautomers (Figure 13d), which were shown to coexist for the ﬁrst time in covalent organic frameworks.", "Figure 13: (a)13C CP-MAS NMR spectrum, (b)15N CP-MAS NMR spectrum, (c) tautomeric OH and NH chemical structures of the ATFG-COF and (d) proposed structure of a 1:1 NH form/OH form composition of ATFG-COF.

Fang et al.reported the synthesis of a polyimide COF assembled with a dye molecule which showed luminescent Chapter 1. Introduction 39 properties (FANG et al., 2014). Based on the imidization reaction, which is commonly used to aﬀord polyimide (PI) polymers, several PI-COFs were prepared based on the model condensation reaction of phtalic anhydride with aniline (Figure 14a). Among the obtained PI-COFs, PI-COF-3 distinguished itself due to its larger pore size of 51 Å, formed from the building blocks pyromellitic dianhydride (PMDA) and 1,3,5-tris[4-amino(1,1-biphenyl- 4-yl)]benzene (TABPB) shown in Figure 14b. Due to its large pore size, the organic dye rhodamine B (RB), a common dye used widely in biotechnology applications, could be accommodated in PI-COF-3 cavities. The dye-doped PI-COF-3 showed ﬂuorescence response at room temperature, and at higher concentrations of RB, a bathochromic shift indicated the presence of RB dymers. Interestingly, the emission spectra showed temperature dependence, whereas the inversely proportional behavior of emission intensity versustemperature could be further investigated towards temperature-sensing devices.

Due to urea’s ﬂexibility around the C–N bonds, several conformations can be generated due to the relatively low rotational barrier of these bonds (BRYANTSEV; FIRMAN; HAY, 2005), and COF-118 presented reversible structural dynamics upon guest introduction and removal attributed to this feature. COF-118 presented structural change upon deactivation and exposure to methanol, acetonitrile or THF under ambient conditions, which increased the crystallinity of the material in the PXRD proﬁle. To conﬁrm this behavior, an infrared study was performed, whereas the activated samples were treated with acetonitrile. The presence of acetonitrile resulted in a shift to a higher wavenumber of the C=O and N-H moieties, that were assigned to a decrease of hydrogen-bonding interactions which favors urea-urea aggregation Chapter 1. Introduction 40 (MATTIA; PAINTER, 2007). That means that upon guest removal, urea groups can potentially participate in interlayer N–H ···O hydrogen-bonding, leading to disordered conformations due to the low energy C–N bond rotation. Therefore, the presence of a guest ceases the intra-framework interactions and restores the COF-118 crystallinity. If the acetonitile was just interacting with the free N-H bonds through hydrogen bonding, the COF-118 N-H bonds would become weaker and conversely a bathochromic shift would have been observed. This feature highlights the importance of linkage rotation and reversible structural dynamics towards constructing a ﬂexible COF.", "Figure 15: Synthesis of COF-118 from 1,3,5-triformylphloroglucinol and DMBDU.

COF-701 was constructed by the acid catalyzed aldol condensation of 2,4,6-trimethyl- 1,3,5-triazine (TMT) and 4,4’-biphenyldicarbaldehyde (BPDA) shown in Figure 16. The aldol reaction between TMT and aryl aldehydes is usally done under a KOH methanolic solution in reﬂux (MEIER; HOLST; OEHLHOF, 2003). However, COF synthesis did not occur through this route and it only aﬀorded the crystalline COF-701 under solvother- mal conditions in a mixture of mesitylene, dioxane, and acetonitrile, bearing catalytic triﬂuoroacetic acid. Due to the low polarity of the new C=C linkages, the resulting COF presented itself stable under inorganic acid and bases and even in the presence of the harsh organolithium reagents. In hold of this new COF, BF 3.OEt 2was immobilized within the material in order to obtain an heterogeneous version of a strong Lewis acid catalyst. The resultant - still crystalline - material, coined as BF 3⊂COF-701, was employed in a benchmark Lewis acid catalyzed Diels-Alder cycloaddition reaction (ZHAO et al., 2019). The catalyst BF 3⊂COF-701 performed with 86% of activity of the free BF 3.OEt 2catalyst, with the advantage of the heterogeneous feature. Despite the total removal of guests after isolation of reaction media, COF-701 presented itself as a remarkable chemical robust material, paving the way for further acidic catalysts immobilizations and for the research towards new covalent linkages in COF materials.", "Moreover, diverse COF structures have been obtained by employing new linkages formation between their starting materials.

Commercially available tri- and tetrapodal building blocks such as TFB, TAPM and TPFP are still very expensive, so juggling the cost of COF synthesis versusits potential application is a good strategy for future endeavors (Figure 17).", "In summary, COF chemistry is undoubtedly heading towards framework precision to a molecular level. Over the 21st century it has been achieved meticulousness control over atoms to assemble a molecule, now the challenge seems to be attaining the same accuracy level on the assemble of molecules into a framework. It sure has been a long way since John Maddox stated “ One of the continuing scandals in the physical sciences is that it remains in general impossible to predict the structure of even the simplest crystalline solids from a knowledge of their chemical composition ” (MADDOX, 1988) or the observation of Hoﬀmann regarding the, at the time, elusive 2D or 3D frameworks in “ Organic chemists are masterful at exercising control in zero dimension. One subculture of organic chemists has learned to exercise control in one dimension. These are polymer chemists, the chain builders... but in two or three dimensions, it is a synthetic wasteland ” (HOFFMANN, At the moment, the current challenges of reticular chemistry, regarding covalent organic frameworks, are (i) controlling the reaction conditions in order to promote micro- scopic reversibility towards a variety of covalent linkages, aﬀording crystalline extended solids and (ii) the advance in the direction of structure-applications relationships. The fol- lowing step would be to (iii) introduce complexity within the framework, heading towards a nature inspired design (DIERCKS; YAGHI, 2017), all factors which were thoroughly investigated throughout the elaboration of this thesis.", "2 Objectives", "Taking into consideration the conceptual approach towards designing a Covalent Organic Framework, and in view of its applications and possibilities, this Thesis is based on the following pending questions:", "(i)Is it possible to use inexpensive building blocks in the synthesis of new COF materials? Since COF materials are usually made in a small scale due to the elevated cost of its building blocks, it would be interesting to use aﬀordable building blocks in their synthesis. A very prominent building block is the 1,3,5-triformylphloroglucinol, this tripodal aldehyde is vastly used in COF synthesis due to its ability to create a 2D material, when reacted with a suitable ditopic building block. In view of the inexpensive feature of phenol derivatives, this study aims at employing phenol, resorcinol and phloroglucinol as starting materials for the design of new COFs; (ii)Which structural factors of the building blocks are important for COF formation and how COFs are aﬀected by those factors? In the synthesis of COFs, it is possible to predict the framework design by the chemical structure of building blocks. However, it is not possible to predict the textural properties of such COFs to the same extent, mainly due to crystallization issues. In this study it is proposed the systematic study of COFs textural properties based on the chemical composition of their building blocks, aiming to obtain a correlation between those factors; (iii)Are these new COFs structurally stable or appropriate to be used as catalysts or adsorbents? In view of creating aﬀordable materials, it would be useful to investigate their robustness towards established applications, such as gas capture and heterogeneous catalysis.", "(iv)Can complexity be introduced in the COF framework by employing amino acids as starting materials for the building blocks? As a proof of concept, a design of bioinspired COF was proposed by using amino acids derivatives as building blocks. Taking advantage of their abundance and inexpensive nature, one wonders if it is possible to achieve such complex structure from simple building blocks.", "This Thesis attempts on answering these questions.", "Part II Synthesis and Characterization of COFs", "3 Synthesis of Hydroxybenzene-based COFs", "3.1 Introduction", "The search for inexpensive building blocks for COF synthesis is an ongoing quest. The potential that these porous, crystalline and robust organic materials possess to be scaled up for industrial applications faces the unavoidable production cost bottleneck. Aiming at synthesizing inexpensive nanomaterials, phenol derivatives were considered the ﬁrst option towards constructing COF building blocks. Costing1respectively ca. R$ 1.55/g, R$ 1.81/g and R$ 7.28/g, phenol, resorcinol and phloroglucinol (Scheme 3.1.1) were chosen as COF starting materials due to their signiﬁcant aﬀordable cost. Transforming these molecules in suitable tripodal building blocks can be done by employing the Duﬀ formylation (DUFF; BILLS, 1932; CHONG et al., 2003), despite its low yields, to obtain the respective tri-aldehydes, which could be further employed in COF synthesis to aﬀord a porous and high crystalline material.", "Scheme 3.1.1: Potential inexpensive building blocks for COF synthesis. By deﬁnition, crystallinity is the presence of three-dimensional order on the level of atomic dimensions (NIČ et al., 2009). Regarding COFs, high crystalline materials are usually associated with a high surface area, often a characteristic essential to their performance (QIAN et al., 2017b). Since this new class of materials is in its infancy, one drawback to overcome in their synthesis is related to the so called “crystallization problem” (WALLER et al., 2016). The International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) deﬁnes (NIČ et al., 2009) crystallization as the formation of a crystalline solid from a solution, while a precipitation is deﬁned as the sedimentation of a solid material (a precipitate) from a liquid solution. Attempts of crystallization can yield solids with diﬀerent fractions of amorphous and crystalline phases, which is the crystallization problem. COF properties, e.g. surface area, are directly related to its crystallinity degree, thus, overcoming this issue is of utmost importance to control its eventual applications.2 1Prices (BRL) accessed at www.sigmaaldrich.com on November 2019.", "2This chapter was adapted with permission from Maia, A.R., Oliveira, F.

Synthesis of Hydroxybenzene-based COFs 46 Methods aiming to obtain highly crystalline COFs take into account several strate- gies, such as, nucleation and/or crystal growth control, either by seeding (EVANS et al., 2018), aging (MA et al., 2018b), using a modulator (MA et al., 2018a; CALIK et al., 2016) or by Ostwald ripening (KANDAMBETH et al., 2015). Some examples are chemical conversion of protected linkages (WALLER et al., 2016), de novo synthesis (QIAN et al., 2017a) and more recently, transimination (MA et al., 2018a; VITAKU; DICHTEL, 2017). Furthermore, it is known that hydrogen bonding can induce molecular aggregation of the building blocks (SIMARD; SU; WUEST, 1991), and long range interaction may be a key factor for organized self-assembly in crystal engineering. Indeed, Chen et al. (CHEN et al., 2015) showed that increasing the sites of hydrogen bonding enhances the crystallinity and porosity of imine-linked porphyrin COFs. Likewise, Li et al.(LI et al., 2016) synthesized a hydrogen bond assisted azine-linked COF, which exhibited a strong orange-red luminescence and Chandra et al.(CHANDRA et al., 2017) reported COF TpPa-(OH) 2, which bears intramolecular hydrogen bonds and exhibited signiﬁcant speciﬁc capacitance.", "Despite the eﬀorts to obtain such crystalline materials, a systematic study on how structural factors and reaction conditions aﬀect the resulting COF is still missing. Considering these issues, COFs RIO-11, RIO-12 and RIO-13 were prepared based on hydrazine and hydroxy-1,3,5-triformylbenzenes, which present a systematic increase of the hydroxyl groups within the aromatic moiety. Factors that aﬀect their crystallinity, such as hydrogen bonding and use of modulator, were investigated.", "3.2 Methodology", "COFs were synthesized based on conventional method of aldehyde-hydrazine con- densation (STEGBAUER et al., 2015). Commercially available hydrazine hydrate (1) was reacted with 1,3,5-triformylphenol (TFF), 1,3,5-triformylresorcinol (TFR) and 1,3,5- triformylphloroglucinol (TFFG) to aﬀord COFs called RIO-11, RIO-12 and RIO-13, respec- tively (Figure 18). The hydroxy-1,3,5-triformylbenzenes were obtained from formylation of phenol, resorcinol and phloroglucinol, according to procedure adapted from the literature (CHONG et al., 2003). This reaction (Scheme 3.2.1) is based on a modiﬁcation of the classical Duﬀ Reaction (DUFF; BILLS, 1932), in which the former employs triﬂuoroacetic acid (TFA) and hexamethylenetetramine (HMTA) (CHONG et al., 2003). This procedure (CHONG et al., 2003) aﬀords a low yield of 14% for the formylation of phloroglucinol with a sluggish reaction workup by extraction with dichloromethane. It is noteworthy to mention that during this study, initial attempts towards formylation of phenol and resorcinol, using the same methodology, resulted in yields lower than 10%. Motivated by improving this reaction eﬃciency, it was found out that by simply carrying out the complete dissolution of HMTA in TFA in an ice bath, instead of room temperature, enabled the product to be Chapter 3.

The stretching mode of C=N for azine/imine COFs have been reported to be lower than the typical value of 1690 cm-1– 1640 cm-1, mainly due to the conjugated nature of this bond (WALLER et al., 2016; NING et al., 2017; DING et al., 2011; CHEN et al., 2015; LI et al., 2016). Additionally, the C=N band broadening and band shift to a lower wavenumber is attributed to increase of intramolecular hydrogen bonding towards the more hydroxylated material (DAS et al., 2014).

Synthesis of Hydroxybenzene-based COFs 56 Monte Carlo algorithm, as implemented in RASPA package (DUBBELDAM et al., 2016), was carried out in order to obtain the theoretical gas adsorption and textural properties of such materials. Lennard-Jones potential was used to treat the Van der Waals interactions. All simulations were carried out with 10000 initiation cycles and 10000 running cycles in a 2x2x4 supercell. The parameters for adsorbed atoms (N and He) were taken from TraPPE force ﬁeld (POTOFF; SIEPMANN, 2001).", "Despite their structural similarity, S BETof RIO-12 and RIO-13 are respectively 4.2 and 5 times higher than RIO-11 (without modulator). RIO-13 seems to have reached its maximum surface area, since its experimental S BETreached 97% (1205 m2/g) of its theoretical value (1238 m2/g). Conversely, RIO-11 (without modulator) is still far from its full potential in terms of surface area, since it reached 14% of its theoretical value, indicating that this material could be further improved. This low surface area for RIO-11 is possibly related to fast and disordered precipitation in the early stages of its synthesis, aﬀording a material with lower speciﬁc surface area. Pore size distributions proﬁles (Figure 24d-f), obtained from ﬁtting the experimental isotherms data to the Non-Local Density Functional Theory (NLDFT), indicate pores sizes of 13.3 Å for RIO-11, RIO-12 and RIO-13. Meanwhile, theoretical pore size of model compounds are 11.98 Å (RIO-11), 12.05 Å (RIO-12) and 12.11 Å (RIO-13), which are in good agreement with the NLDFT data. The NLDFT method describes the adsorption on porous materials and it is useful for either micropore or mesopore analysis. This method can analyze the pore size distribution as a uniﬁed theory, which is an advantage compared to other methods, along with its accuracy of micropore size analysis (RAVIKOVITCH; NEIMARK, 2001; LANDERS; GOR; NEIMARK, 2013).", "Figure 24g-i shows theoretical (green) and experimental (blue and red) powder X-ray diﬀraction (PXRD) of RIO-11 (without modulator), RIO-12 and RIO-13. The main diﬀraction peaks are located around 2 θangles of 6 °(100), 11 °(210), and 27 °(002), the latter attributed to π-stacking (KARAK et al., 2017). RIO-11 synthesized without the use of a modulator presented signiﬁcant lower crystallinity (Figure 24g, blue) than RIO-12 (Figure 24h, blue) and RIO-13 (Figure 24i, blue), evidenced by its broader peaks in PXRD, suggesting a lack of organization in the structure. In view of the fact that broader peaks can be attributed to very small crystallites that do not diﬀract well due to fewer crystalline planes (associated with fewer electrons for X-ray diﬀraction), the size of the mean crystallite domain ( L) was evaluated by employing the Scherrer equation (PATTERSON, 1939). Indeed, by analyzing the data in Table 1, it is shown that the mean crystallite size for RIO-11, RIO-12 and RIO-13 is very similar and around 50 Å. Thus, the lack of crystallinity in RIO-11 cannot be attributed to very small crystallites, but solely to a lack of organization in its structure. If the crystallites were in fact too small to provide a reasonable diﬀraction pattern, then RIO-12 and RIO-13 would have to necessarily provide a diﬀraction proﬁle similar to RIO-11: with broader and less intense Chapter 3.

Experimental interplanar distances referring to the plane (002), according to Bragg’s law (BRAGG; BRAGG et al., 1913), are 3.30 Å, 3.27 Å and 3.25 Å for RIO-11 (without modulator), RIO-12 and RIO-13, respectively (Table 2). Those values are compatible with similar materials, such as graphite, which has an interlayer distance of 3.4 Å (BERNAL, 1924; HASSEL; MARK, 1924). Interplanar distances obtained from optimized geometries from DFT calculations are 3.71 Å, 3.66 Å and 3.63 Å for RIO-11, RIO-12 and RIO-13 respectively, which are in good agreement with experimental results.", "3.3.1 The Role of Hydrogen Bonding in Crystallinity", "Data analyses of COFs synthesized without the use of a modulator showed a signiﬁcant diﬀerence in crystallinity among the materials. Remarkably for RIO-11, which has the lower surface area and crystallinity, when compared to RIO-12 and RIO-13 (Figure 24a-c, blue; g-i, blue).", "Although there is an increase of a single hydroxyl group from RIO-11 to RIO- 12, and from RIO-12 to RIO-13, the diﬀerence in the properties (BET surface area and crystallinity) when comparing RIO-11 and RIO-12 is more prominent than when comparing RIO-12 and RIO-13. Thus, the materials properties do not vary linearly with the increase of the number of hydroxyl groups in the aromatic moieties. With all the compounds having hydroxyl and imine groups in their vicinity, it is reasonable to consider that hydrogen bonding might play a role in structure conformation. Non-covalent interactions usually play a key role in structure organization, with hydrogen bonding having a locking eﬀect in previously reported COFs (CHEN et al., 2015).", "RIO-11, RIO-12 and RIO-13 form an extended structure by 3 imine linkages Chapter 3. Synthesis of Hydroxybenzene-based COFs 58 throughout the triangular aromatic moieties. It has been proposed (DIERCKS; YAGHI, 2017) that higher symmetry in the building blocks may result in higher crystallinity. In RIO-11, only one imine group is locked in a conformation due to hydrogen bonding, while two other imine linkages are free to assume four additional conformations (Figure 26a). This disturbs the symmetry of the material, which eventually compromises its crystallinity by tilting and disorganizing the arrangement of the 2D sheets in a phenomenon known as turbostratic disorder (CÔTÉ et al., 2005). The four possible conformers for RIO-11 could be randomly formed in the early nucleation stages of the resulting COF, increasing the amorphous fraction of this material (Figure 25, left). In RIO-12, two imine groups are conformationally locked by hydrogen bonding, leaving only one conformationally free imine group. Thus, there would be two possible conformers in the resulting COF (Figure 26b), which would justify the higher symmetry of RIO-12 when compared to RIO-11, but could also result in some degree of amorphous phase (Figure 25, center). On the other hand, all three imine groups are conformationally locked due to hydrogen bonding in RIO-13 (Figure 26c). This results in a single conformation of higher symmetry, aﬀording the most crystalline COF (Figure 25, right).", "Figure 25: Schematic representation of turbostratic disorder of RIO-11, RIO-12 and The most remarkable consequence of these conformational locks is presented in the BET surface area. RIO-11, RIO-12 and RIO-13 reached 14 %, 68 % and 97%, respectively, of its theoretical S BET. Since the main chemical diﬀerence among these materials is the number of hydroxyl groups in the aromatic moiety, it is reasonable to think that the disparity in S BETis mainly attributed to the increase of crystallinity due to hydrogen bonding eﬀects, supported experimentally by broadening of C=N peaks and their shift to lower wavenumber in FTIR (Figure 19). Although hydrogen bonding can be determined by resolving the chemical structure by single crystal X-ray diﬀraction in small molecules and in some materials as MOFs, this is usually not possible in COF chemistry. It is extremely diﬃcult to obtain single crystals from COFs, and only a few have been reported so far (EVANS et al., 2018; MA et al., 2018a; ZHANG et al., 2013). As such, hydrogen bonding is usually reported in COFs by analysis of the infrared spectra, regarding the broadening Chapter 3.

Therefore, if single crystals from RIO-11, RIO-12 and RIO-13 would be obtained, it is expected that the intramolecular hydrogen bonding would be detected by resolving their structure by single crystal X-ray diﬀraction.", "3.3.2 Inﬂuence of Aniline as Modulator", "It is known that amorphous COFs, especially from imine linkages, arise from fast disordered nucleation and subsequent precipitation of amorphous imine aggregates (DUNCAN et al., 2012; SMITH et al., 2016). Thus, aﬀording a kinetic product that cannot anneal in a timely manner to aﬀord a crystalline material, mainly due to strong covalent bonding and π-stacking, which prevents its redissolution (NGUYEN; GRÜNWALD, 2018). The amorphous phase may be formed from a constellation of random combinations of possible conformers, with slightly diﬀerent shapes, leading to defects. Thus, one might consider that controlling the equilibrium within the reaction vessel could increase the crystallinity of materials that are not favored by chemical structure per se, such as RIO-11. Competition of one of the building blocks with a small monopodal molecule is known as a modulator approach (CALIK et al., 2016). This means that since nucleation is favored by similar rates of product formation and its reagent regeneration, reaction equilibrium control would lead to a path of slow and controlled nucleation and, consequently, more eﬃcient crystallization. Based on that, it was decided to use aniline as modulator in order to decrease the nucleation rate and favor crystal growth, which in theory would prevent fast precipitation of amorphous phase.", "The addition of aniline in the reaction would lead to the formation of an imine as Chapter 3. Synthesis of Hydroxybenzene-based COFs 60 intermediate, which would undergo through transimination with hydrazine (1) to aﬀord the corresponding COF (Scheme 3.3.1). Since these steps would not involve the sudden for- mation of an amorphous aggregate, this transimination would facilitate thermodynamically the self-healing and annealing of the material, resulting in a COF with fewer defects than the one from the previous approach (without modulator). Also, possible oligomeric phases formed would suﬀer Ostwald ripening in favor of larger and more stable COF crystals. This methodology would lead to a material with greater crystallinity and, consequently, higher surface area.", "Scheme 3.3.1: Equilibria involved in crystallization of COFs when modulator is used. Recently, transimination was reported by Vitaku and Dichtel (VITAKU; DICHTEL, 2017) regarding N-aryl benzophenone imines and 1,3,5-triformylbenzene in order to synthe- size the BND-TFB COF. Although this method provided materials with high crystallinity and high surface area, the imine formation involves the use of 1,4-diazobicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO), Titanium (IV) chloride, chlorobenzene and under inert atmosphere. Meanwhile, this study proposed approach provides the transimination building block (2) in a simpler manner: condensation of 1,3,5-triformylphenol (TFF) with 7.4 equiv. of aniline (6) in methanol under reﬂux for 24 h (Scheme 3.3.2a; Table 3, entry 7). When performing this methodology in two steps, using (2) as a building block for synthesis of RIO-11, the latter was obtained as a more crystalline material (Figure 24g, red) and with BET surface area of 1290 m2/g (Figure 24a, red, 77% of the theoretical S BET). Another approach was the in situtransimination (Scheme 3.3.2b). It consists in reacting 1,3,5-triformyphenol (TFF) and aniline (6) for 30 min in mesitylene/1,4-dioxane. The formation of (2) in situis visually detected, since the yellow suspension of 1,3,5-triformylphenol (TFF) readily becomes a clear red solution right after aniline (6) is added. After that, hydrazine (1) and acetic acid are added, thus aﬀording COF RIO-11 after 72 h at 120 °C.", "Chapter 3.

NH 2:CHO ratio S BET(m2/g) aResult for two-step ( ex situ) transimination.", "The necessary amount of aniline (6) for RIO-11 in situtransimination was inves- tigated (Table 3). The best result was achieved with a 1:1.5 (Entry 4) NH 2:CHO ratio (2.0 equiv.), aﬀording the higher BET surface area (1050 m2/g) for the in situsynthesis. Additionally, 1:3 (Entry 3) and 1:1 (Entry 5) NH 2:CHO ratio provided 940 m2/g and 851 m2/g, respectively. Thus, 2.0 equiv. of aniline (6) resulted in the most favorable condition. NH2:CHO ratios of 1:15 (Entry 2) and 1:0.4 (Entry 6) and 1:30 (Entry 1) aﬀorded BET surface areas of 571 m2/g, 621 m2/g and 965 m2/g, respectively. Thereby, very small or very large NH 2:CHO ratios are not favorable for formation of more crystalline RIO-11 by in situtransimination. Although Entry 4 aﬀords 81% of surface area obtained in Entry 7, thein situmethodology is a more straightforward and convenient synthesis, given that the two-step synthesis consumes more reaction time and chemicals.", "Relying on this promising result, it was proposed a one-pot reaction, in which the Chapter 3. Synthesis of Hydroxybenzene-based COFs 62 imine is initially formed, followed by COF formation. Successfully, RIO-11 was prepared in situ by transimination of 1,3,5-triphenyliminephenol with surface area of 1050 m2/g. These conditions were used to prepare RIO-12 and RIO-13 by transimination to observe if crystallinity and surface area could be improved. When in situtransimination conditions were used for RIO-12, a BET area of 887 m2/g was obtained. This is a lower area when compared with RIO-12 without use of modulator (1008 m2/g), however this lies within the acceptable range of variation in the synthesis of these type of materials. On the other hand, the use of modulator in RIO-13 leads to a material with 338 m2/g of area, which corresponds to a decrease of the surface area in relation to the synthesis without use of modulator (1205 m2/g). One possible explanation is the fact that RIO-13 forms a keto-imine adduct, as previously reported (STEGBAUER et al., 2015). Such adducts are resistant to nucleophilic attack, which makes the use of modulator deleterious to the process, since it does not allow reaction reversibility, which is essential for obtaining high crystalline materials.", "In general, a variety of COF building blocks do not present intramolecular hydrogen bonding. Thus, this methodology could beneﬁt new and previously reported COFs in reaching their full potential, making the in situtransimination a promising methodology regarding COF synthesis.", "3.4 Conclusion", "In this study, an improvement of the formylation reaction to aﬀord the phenol derivatives building blocks (TFF, TFR and TFFG) was achieved. By changing one reaction parameter – the temperature of HMTA dissolution – it was possible to increase to a 6-fold the yield previously reported in the literature (CHONG et al., 2003). Thereby, a more eﬃcient synthesis of the COFs building blocks was established, stimulating even more the use of inexpensive phenol derivatives in the preparation of nanomaterials. As such, the hydroxybenzene-based COFs RIO-11, RIO-12 and RIO-13 were successfully prepared and studied based on their textural properties (S BETand PXRD).", "In this study, it was discussed that intramolecular hydrogen bonding formation in COFs may lead to conformational locking eﬀects, which inﬂuence the crystallinity of the resulting materials. These conformational locks increase the symmetry of one of the building blocks (1,3,5-hydroxy-triformylbenzenes). In the absence of these conformational locks, diﬀerent conformations available during nucleation might lead to disordered crystal growth, resulting in defects and in a less crystalline material. The annealing never occurs on a reasonable time scale, leading to the formation of a (kinetic) solid product of low crystallinity and smaller surface area. Slow conversion of these defects, through equilibria into a more stable and crystalline phase, increases the surface area of the resulting material. Chapter 3. Synthesis of Hydroxybenzene-based COFs 63 When COFs are not beneﬁted from conformational locks, another strategy can be used. The use of aniline as modulator, with in situformation of an intermediate imine, indicates that a diﬀerent and slower nucleation mechanism takes place, which happens through transimination with hydrazine. This results in COFs with higher crystallinity and surface areas, reaching closer to their theoretical limit. This is particularly useful for the synthesis of COFs using less symmetrical building blocks, in which conformational locks are not present, such as in the case of RIO-11. In this case, a 5.3-fold increase of BET surface area and a higher degree of crystallinity were observed.", "In view of this study, it was possible to establish a relationship between the chemical structure of the building blocks and the resulting textural properties, such as surface area and crystallinity. However, those are not the sole ones that can be analyzed in a porous material,characteristicssuchassurfacesmoothness,fractaldimensionsandporositystudies, with statistical robustness are also relevant for the thorough study of COF materials. However, these features are not obtained by conventional characterization techniques, and advanced tools should be employed to better understand these characteristics.", "4 Study of COFs by Small-Angle X-Ray Scat-", "tering", "4.1 Introduction", "The need for a wider range of characterization techniques regarding extended materials is due to the complexity of a higher-level framework, as well as their insolubility. Typically, the most common routine characterization techniques for COFs include gas (usually N 2or Ar) adsorption/desorption isotherms to access porosity and surface area; PXRD to conﬁrm crystallinity and phase purity; Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA) to determine their thermal stability; solid-state NMR to evaluate bond formation and purity of the sample; and Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) to conﬁrm the presence of functional groups and detect if there are any unreacted monomers. Therefore, structure elucidation of an extended structure has a puzzle- likeapproach, where it relies on combining the results of each technique and observing which bigger picture will be unveiled. Occasionally, the previously mentioned techniques are not suﬃcient to fully describe the material characteristics, either from a structure elucidation or a potential application point of view. In this case, the use of additional techniques provides valuable information that complements the characterization of a certain material.1 Among several nanomaterials characterization techniques, Small Angle X-Ray Scattering (SAXS) stands out as an accurate, non-destructive method that requires a minimum of sample preparation in solid state analysis (SCHNABLEGGER; SINGH, 2013). Since it operates typically in the range of 1 to 60 nm, it is vastly used mainly in silica and zeolites for characterizations of porosities (MASCOTTO et al., 2009), the study of particles external morphology (DU; WU, 2007) and hierarchical structure organization (LI; SENESI; LEE, 2016). Regarding existing theoretical models for SAXS analysis, one can point out the studies of Guinier (GUINIER, 1939), Porod (POROD; GLATTER; KRATKY, 1982), Beaucage (BEAUCAGE; SCHAEFER, 1994) and Bragg (BRAGG; BRAGG et al., 1913) as highlighted choices when it comes to the study of nanoporous materials. Their valuable information about fractal dimension, radius of gyration, hierarchical structures and structure peaks, respectively, makes SAXS an elegant choice for the study of reticular porous materials.", "Despite its wide application in silica, zeolites and more recently in MOFs (TSAO et al., 2007; GOESTEN et al., 2013; ZHAO et al., 2011; STAVITSKI et al., 2011), the use of SAXS for studying COFs is still scarce.

Study of COFs by Small-Angle X-Ray Scattering 65 kinetic of COF-5 crystalline nanoparticles formation by evaluation of the integrated area of the emerging structure peaks over reaction time. Furthermore, PC-COF, a polycationic COF, had its porosity conﬁrmed by the structure peaks of mesopores within the SAXS range (YU et al., 2016). Similarly, Zhao et al.investigated the topology of TP-COF-DAB and TP-COF-BZ employing SAXS, the triple pore suggested structure was conﬁrmed by SAXS mesopore structure peaks and the unit cell values were in agreement with those found in PXRD and in theoretical simulation (QIAN et al., 2017a). It is important to point out that the primary use of SAXS in COFs so far is to conﬁrm the unit cell by the structure peaks of mesoporous materials since they are not observable in PXRD, either due to their small diﬀraction angle and/or due to the noise from the low angle background. In the previous examples, these structure peaks, which describe the ordered spacing of atoms, are crucial to conﬁrm the presence of mesoporous materials and their mean crystallite size. However, the data that can be extracted from SAXS provides such abundant information that it has the potential to lead to an even more detailed discussion of the scattering curves. The aim of this part of the thesis is to use SAXS for studying the nanostructure of several COFs beyond the structure peaks, approaching surface smoothness, fractal dimensions, radius of gyration and hierarchical structures as unique and relevant information that can be extracted from the scattering curves. Additionally, it was also demonstrated that when combining the results from SAXS with other techniques, such as N 2isotherms and PXRD, the Beaucage model can be better ﬁtted to mesoporous COFs.", "4.2 Methodology", "Figure 27: Chemical structure of micro- and mesoporous COFs studied by SAXS.

Because of that, this law has been extended (BALE; SCHMIDT, 1984) to accommodate rougher surfaces, in which a characteristic asymptotic power-law of q−αis useful to determinate the fractal scale of the desired material with αvalues. The fractal scale is related to the statistic description of the scattering object properties, which can be expressed whether in mass fractal dimension or surface fractal dimension parameters.

Thus, Dm=αfor the range of 1< α< 3 andDs= 6−αfor the range of 3 <α< 4. For a smooth boundary surface, Ds= 2, representing the Porod’s law classical exponential of α= 4.

This structure is assembled by small small-scaled sub-structures, whose fractal features are observed in the high- qpower-law regime. Furthermore, these regions are connected by an exponential decay that reﬂects the average size of the substructural particles.

If there is no agglomerate of smaller particles, RsubandRscoincide and this is indeed the smaller domain of the particle (Figure 28b), which is precisely the radius of the primary particle. If agglomerates of subunits are present, Rsubis not the smaller domain, being composed by even smaller particles represented by Rs. In the last case, Rs is compulsorily smaller than Rsub. For a better understanding of this model, a general representation of a hierarchical structure can be found in Figure 29.", "Figure 29: A general example of a hierarchical structure where a larger structure is composed of smaller structures with diﬀerent radius of gyration.", "In a broader context, the theory regarding the X-ray scattering of nanoparticles can be applied to numerous types of materials, as long as ﬁtting these materials to the appropriate models.

In the low- qregion,qvalues are closer to 0.1 nm-1, so the observation window is around 60 nm and larger features of the scattering object can be detected. Conversely, in the high- qregion,qvalues are closer to 5 nm-1, so the observation window is closer to 1 nm and smaller features of the scattering object can be observed. Figure 31a represents this concept for a general porous material: the low- q region may be able to give information about the dimension of the scattering object ( Rg), if it falls within the SAXS range. While the high- qregion gives information about the up-close details of the sample, in this case it is the pore – again – if it is comprised within the SAXS range.

Similarly, the existence of a smaller subunit (the pore) and its analysis ( RsuborRs) can be made only if the Beaucage model can be applied.

For this value of the Porod parameter, the fractal characteristic of these samples ﬁts in the surface fractal Chapter 4. Study of COFs by Small-Angle X-Ray Scattering 73 category (Table 5), since their αvalues are greater than 3.0. Only for RIO-12, two diﬀerent αvalues are observed along the scattering curve: α= 3.2for the low-q region and α= 3.8 for the high- qregion. Thus, for RIO-12, two distinct surface features can be observed: (i) a smoother surface for the smaller observation window, with a Ds= 2.2and (ii) a rougher surface for a wider observation window, with Ds= 2.8. Therefore, based on the Dsvalues obtained in Table 5, all of the microporous COFs presented a smooth surface throughout the scattering curve, except for RIO-12 in the low- qregion, and all COFs present surface fractal features.", "Since RIO-12 presents two diﬀerent Porod parameters for the SAXS curve, this curve was initially ﬁtted to the Beaucage model in the software Sasﬁt, version 0.94.10 (BRESSLER; KOHLBRECHER; THÜNEMANN, 2015), aiming to obtain more detailed aspects about its nanostructure. The heterogeneous electronic density nature in porous materials led to consider a model where the framework represents the larger structure and the pore represents the subunit. Thus, the larger structure would be associated with the solid content of the framework, and therefore associated with Rg; and the smallest subunit would be represented by the voids and assumed as the pore, which would be related to RsorRsub, represented in a general fashion in Figure 31b. However, since the COF pore radius that would be related to the radius of the subunit is below the range that can be analyzed by SAXS (< 1 nm), the aforementioned model could not be applied without uncertainty. However, it can be stated that this fractal dimension transition from 3.8 to 3.2 means the approach towards a Guinier shoulder at a very low- qregion. Additionally, since the Guinier shoulder is only notable for RIO-12 in the SAXS range, it suggests that the radius of gyration of the scattering object related to RIO-12 is smaller than the other materialsRg, since the region related to the Guinier zone for RIO-12 (related to the larger observation window) would be located at a higher value of q(in the low- qregion), when comparing it to the other microporous COFs. However, it is still out of range to obtain the precise Rgvalues because they lie bellow the range that can be analyzed by SAXS, but could be potentially accessed by Ultra-Small-Angle X-Ray Scattering (USAXS). Arising structure peaks can be thus observed at q= 5 nm-1for RIO-11, RIO-12 and RIO-13 in the SAXS curves (Figure 30, top). These structure peaks, which are located on the transient region between SAXS and PXRD, are better visualised when combining both analyses by simply converting the PXRD 2 θtoqdimensions by the relation expressed in Equation 4.1. SAXS becomes useful for microporous materials to conﬁrm the sole presence of the latter, or not, to the porosity of the material. Sometimes a contribution of mesoporosity may emerge due to defects within the structure that were not corrected during the reaction equilibria that operate in COF formation. This eﬀect can be due to lack of solubility of the oligomers in the reaction solvent, the kinetic formation of a precipitate or an improper solvent choice, which limits the reverse reaction reversibility, a critical factor to error-correction during crystallisation. Thus, since there are no structure peaks in Chapter 4. Study of COFs by Small-Angle X-Ray Scattering 74 the SAXS region, it is possible to conﬁrm that (periodic) mesoporosity is not statistically relevant to the studied microporous materials. The (100) peak maximum for RIO-11, RIO-12 and RIO-13 was found indeed to be 5.0 nm-1, that corresponds to the interplane distance of 1.3 nm, which is the exact pore size value found with the Non-Linear Density Function Theory (NLDFT) model based on N 2adsorption-desorption isotherms (Table 5). The other structure peaks are 8.3 nm-1and 19.2 nm-1, where the latter is related to the π-stacking of the lamellar sheets of these 2D COFs. For RIO-14 and RIO-4, much more discrete structure peaks are observed around 8.5 nm-1, 13.8 nm-1and 30.0 nm-1, whereas the 3D framework of RIO-14 and RIO-4 leads to a diﬀerent diﬀraction pattern than their 2D COFs counterparts. Additionally, the 2D microporous COFs are more (periodically) organized than the 3D microporous COFs due to their more intense and narrower structure peaks.", "Furthermore, taking into account microporous COFs in general, it would be in- teresting to regularly combine SAXS with Wide-Angle X-ray Scattering (WAXS) when analysing these types of materials. Since WAXS upper limit is around 30 nm-1, this would allow the observation of features with resolution of 0.2 nm, granting a more in-depth view of the porous characteristics of these materials. Additionally, to obtain the radius of gyration by the Guinier approximation for these speciﬁc studied microporous COFs, it would be necessary to access the scattering range of the Guinier zone at a lower- qfor the respective curves, which could be achieved by using Ultra-Small Angle X-Ray Scattering (USAXS). For all the microporous COFs samples, a reasonable Guinier ﬁtting range could not be established, meaning that the scattering objects sizes are greater than 60 nm.", "4.4.2 Mesoporous COFs", "The small-angle X-ray scattering curves for the mesoporous samples are shown in Figure 7.

For the low- qregion, the material FeCl 3@TPB-DMTP-COF 12% presented a surface fractal dimension which was found to be the smoothest surface among the mesoporous COFs, bearing a Dsof 2.1. Meanwhile, [HC ≡C]0.17TPB-DMTP-COF and FeCl 3@TPB- DMTP-COF 7.8% are in the intermediate surface fractal dimension zone with Dsof 2.5 and 2.4, respectively. TPB-DMTP-COF SU4 and TPB-DMTP-COF SU5 present relatively rougher surfaces, both with Dsof 2.8. Still, all the scaled-up and functionalized materials presented a smoother surface, when a larger window of observation is taken, than the pristine TPB-DMTP-COF, that bears a Dmof 2.7. Considering the results, it is evident that the scale-up of TPB-DMTP-COF or incorporation of iron and ethynyl groups in its framework aﬀords smoother features for the low- qregion. The scale-up of four or ﬁve times has the same impact on the surface smoothness, however, the incorporation of iron or an alkyne group in the framework has a more prominent eﬀect due to their αvalues, which are closer to 4. As for the high- qregion, a mass fractal dimension is predominant for the mesoporous materials, indicating scattering objects that distance themselves even more from Porod’s law.

TPB-DMTP αqrange (nm-1)Dm Ds COF Low- qHigh-qLow-qHigh-q The scale-up of the TPB-DMTP-COF was performed to observe if there were any changes in the general textural characteristics of the resulting material. It is not unusual that the scale-up of COFs results in a decrease of surface area, crystallinity and other features derived from these factors, though limiting their application in several ﬁelds when a more substantial amount of COF is required (BUNCK; DICHTEL, 2013; KARAK et al., 2017; YANG et al., 2012b). To this extent, it was noticed that when the synthesis of TPB- DMTP-COF was increased 4 times, the surface area was lowered by approximately 23% (from 1736 m2/g to 1345 m2/g), but when a scale-up of 5 times was performed, the surface area decreased drastically, by about 76% from its original value (from 1736 m2/g to 410 m2/g). Evidently, the structure peaks in the SAXS-PXRD plot (Figure 33) also exhibited a diﬀerent proﬁle for the latter. While the peaks intensity for TPB-DMTP-COF SU4 (Figure 33b) was very similar to the pristine COF (Figure 33a), the decrease of crystallinity for TPB-DMTP-COF SU5 (Figure 33c) was noticeable due to the lower intensity of the peaks. Therefore, a scale-up of 4 times for the TPB-DMTP-COF comprehended minimum changes regarding surface area and crystallinity, whereas a scale-up greater than four times compromised the aforementioned characteristics.", "Additionally, the structure peaks in the SAXS curves hold essential information for mesoporous materials: if there are any constructive interferences patterns within the SAXS region (0.1 – 5.0 nm-1), the pore size of mesoporous materials can be detected by Bragg’s law within the range of 1 – 60 nm, outstanding as a technique to stand beside N 2 adsorption-desorption isotherms to detect mesoporosity in COFs.

The Miller index referent for this structure peaks are shown in Figure 33b, where the peaks 2.0 nm-1, 3.4 (200), (210) and (220), respectively. It should be noticed that these structure peaks would not be able to be experimentally addressed if it was not for their diﬀraction pattern which glimpses within the SAXS range. Besides that, for the hexagonal structures, it is possible to estimate the lattice parameter (Table 7).", "Thus, TPB-DMTP-COF, TPB-DMTP-COF SU4, TPB-DMTP-COF SU5 and [HC≡C]0.17TPB-DMTP-COF presented a lattice parameter of 3.6 nm, 3.6 nm, 3.8 nm and 3.6 nm, respectively, which correlates well with the NLDFT BET pore size of 3.4 nm for the materials. It is also noteworthy to analyse how the position of the structure peaks vary in function of the scale-ups and post-functionalization modiﬁcations with ethynyl and iron incorporation, considering that this evaluation gives information on structural changes that may occur in the framework. When scale-up is performed by four times (TPB-DMTP-COF SU4, Figure 33b), the diﬀraction pattern remains essentially in the same position (Table 7) as the parent material (Figure 33a), meaning that the atoms organization within the framework do not change when the synthesis stoichiometry is increased by a fourfold. On the other hand, TPB-DMTP-COF SU5 (Figure 33c) presents some structural changes when a scale-up of 5 times was employed. In relation to the pristine material, the ﬁrst structure peak shifts to a lower value of q, from 2.0 nm-1to 1.9 nm-1, respectively. This shift means that the interlayer distance related to this peak increases from 3.1 nm to 3.3 nm, respectively. Also, the peak associated with the π-stacking of TPB-DMTP-COF SU5 shifts to a smaller interlayer distance when comparing to the parent material: from 0.35 nm to 0.33 nm, respectively. Thus, an increase of the unit cell and a decrease in theπ-stacking distance are observed when the synthesis stoichiometry is increased by a Chapter 4. Study of COFs by Small-Angle X-Ray Scattering 78 ﬁvefold. Similarly to TPB-DMTP-COF SU4, no structural changes are observed when ethynyl groups are functionalized into the framework (Figure 33d), although a decrease of crystallinity is observed due to the lower intensity of the structure peaks. However, when iron is incorporated into the COF (Figure 33e-f), the diﬀraction pattern drastically changes and the structure peaks are suppressed in the SAXS range, possibly as a result of turbostratic disorder (BOCK et al., 1997; CÔTÉ et al., 2005) due to the larger size of the iron atom, when compared to smaller atoms as carbon and nitrogen. Additionally, it can be noted that when FeCl 3is added to TPB-DMTP-COF, the surface area of the material decreases signiﬁcantly up to 8 times due to the complexed iron within the pores (CIFUENTES et al., 2018). Thus, N 2adsorption is impaired, leading to a smaller surface area.", "Figure 33: SAXS-PXRD plot for the mesoporous COFs: PXRD combined with SAXS curve and ﬁtting of the Beaucage model for the latter.", "For the other mesoporous COFs, as mentioned for the case of RIO-12, diﬀerent αvalues along the SAXS curves may indicate that a hierarchical structure is present. Thus, the materials which showed this behavior (TPB-DMTP-COF SU5, [HC ≡C]0.17TPB- DMTP-COF, FeCl 3@TPB-DMTP-COF 7.8% and FeCl 3@TPB-DMTP-COF 12%) were studied based on the Beaucage uniﬁed model (detailed ﬁtting parameters are described in the Materials and Methods part).", "To evaluate these hierarchical structures under this model, PandPswere ﬁxed as theαvalues for low- qand high- q, respectively. Additionally, due to the heterogeneous Chapter 4. Study of COFs by Small-Angle X-Ray Scattering 79 electronic density in porous materials, the smallest subunit was assumed as the pore and its radius of gyration, Rs, was ﬁxed as half of the pore size of each respective material. The value of the pore size was obtained from the BET analysis of the N 2isotherms and it was used as a pre-ﬁxed parameter in the Beaucage equation to ﬁt the envisioned structure model. For all the mesoporous modelled results, Rsubwas found equal to Rs, meaning that a two-level hierarchical structure was unanimous for all the samples. Thus, the larger structure - related to Rg- is attributed to the surrounding material (framework) and the smallest structure - related to Rsub- is attributed to the heterogeneities (the pores) for all the mesoporous samples. For a better description of the resulting scattering object derived from the settled parameters, Figure 34 represents the two-level hierarchical structure model for the studied mesoporous materials that ﬁt in this category. In Figure 34, the larger scattering object (left) is a porous material in which the pores are organized in a hexagonal structure, as discussed regarding their structure peaks (Figure 34 centre, dotted line). The pores do not need to be necessarily hexagonal to convey in this hexagonal array, but in this case, the geometrical structure of the building blocks of TPB-DMTP-COF - 2,5-dimethoxyterephthalaldehyde and 1,3,5-tri-(4-aminophenyl)benzene – allows to predict the shape of the pore owing to the design premises of COFs (DING; WANG, 2013; CAI et al., 2016; MEDINA; SICK; BEIN, 2017). The hexagonal assembly of the pores forms the pore channels (Figure 34, right) by the π-stacking of the 2D layers of the COF. Figure 34: The porous scattering objects (left); pores organized in a hexagonal structure (centre) and the pore channels formed by π-stacking of the 2D layers of the COF (right). Regarding TPB-DMTP-COF SU5, when the material was scaled up ﬁve times of its original scale, it presented αvalues of 3.2 and 2.0 for the low- and high- q, respectively. The two-level hierarchical structure found was assembled by a larger structure (framework), that presented a Rg≥60 nm, consisting of small subunits (pores) of Rsub1.6 nm. The Chapter 4. Study of COFs by Small-Angle X-Ray Scattering 80 larger structure presented a Dsof 2.8 related to the surrounding material and the smallest subunit presented a pore mass fractal dimension of 2.0. Thus, when a scale up of 5 times was employed to TPB-DMTP-COF a hierarchical structure was observed, behavior which did not occur when a scale up of 4 times was performed.", "When ethynyl groups were inserted in the material, a similar behavior to TPB- DMTP-COF SU5 was found: [HC ≡C]0.17TPB-DMTP-COF showed a larger structure (framework) of Rg≥60 nm and a smaller subunit (pore) of Rsub1.7 nm. The larger structure presented a Dsof 2.5, related to the surrounding material. Furthermore, the smallest subunit presented a pore mass fractal dimension of 2.8. Furthermore, the ethynyl graphitization does not seem to aﬀect drastically the material surface area, meaning that TPB-DMTP-COF is a potential good candidate to be used in post-synthetic modiﬁcation regarding small organic molecules incorporation.", "On the other hand, when FeCl 3was added to COF TPB-DMTP-COF, a diﬀerent behavior was shown. When the incorporated iron amount was 7.8%, the surrounding material presented a Rgdimension≥55 nm and the pore presented a dimension, Rsub, of 1.7 nm.

However, whentheamountofFeCl 3wasincreasedfrom7.8%to12%,thedimensionofthesurrounding material decreased to Rg= 40 nm while preserving the smallest subunit with Rsubof 1.7 nm. The surrounding material related to the larger structure showed a Dsof 2.1 and the pore presented a pore mass fractal dimension of 1.9. Thus, indicating that the addition of FeCl 3to TPB-DMTP-COF induces the formation of a hierarchical structure when compared to the parent material. The size of the larger structure is ≥55 nm when 8.7% of FeCl 3is incorporated, but decreases to 40 nm when a higher content (12%) of iron is added to the TPB-DMTP-COF.", "4.5 Conclusion", "Regarding COFs textural characterization, SAXS stands out as an essential tech- nique mostly due to its information about particle aggregation, smoothness or roughness of a scattering object, mesoporous structure peaks and modelling of hierarchical structures. Combined with other techniques, such as PXRD and BET surface area, SAXS results allow a more in-depth investigation of the textural properties of COFs, especially when an analogous group is under study. Thus, detailed and quantitative fractal changes in their frameworks can be appropriately addressed, as well as being able to identify a textural behavior tendency within the studied materials. In this study, it was possible to investigate hierarchical structures based on the Beaucage model for the majority of mesoporous COFs. The proposed two-level hierarchical structure allowed a better description of mesoporous Chapter 4. Study of COFs by Small-Angle X-Ray Scattering 81 COFs in terms of fractality and smoothness/rugosity features, where those character- istics could be related either to the pore or to the solid framework. The ﬁtting of the Beaucage model showed interesting fractal results: while the scattering object related to the surrounding material (framework) is solely a surface fractal, the heterogeneity (pore) is unanimously a mass fractal. Thus, SAXS presents itself as a simple measurement technique but aﬀords robust data when the appropriate models are employed. Regarding chemical modiﬁcations in TPB-DMTP-COF, functionalized and scaled up materials presented a smoother surface when compared to the pristine COF. Scale-up of the material indeed makes the surface smoother, however, it is the pore functionalization, either with iron or ethynyl, that makes the surface even smoother. Regarding microporous COFs, it was shown that these materials present mostly smooth surface of the scattering objects, as well as surface fractals, for both low- and high- q. Some textural features could not be accessed for microporous COFs due to mainly: (i) the scattering associated to the micropores are not comprised in the SAXS range, thus it would be useful to investigate the full scattering curve up to the WAXS upper qlimit; (ii) the radius of gyration of the microporous studied COFs are higher than 60 nm, thus a combination with USAXS would be necessary to evaluate a greater value of Rg. Therefore, a complete characterization of the scattering proﬁle for the microporous COFs would take advantage of a USAXS-SAXS-WAXS plot, since it would be useful to ﬁt the microporous COFs to the Beaucage model (as it was performed for the mesoporous COFs) and to obtain the radius of gyration for the scattering objects. Indeed, data treatment is crucial for obtaining valuable results, which could be interpreted as a function of the nature of the material. Furthermore, acquisition of the intensity of the scattering curves as a function of the scattering vector (I( q)) in absolute scale can be an alternative to obtain the speciﬁc surface area, which lies as a perspective for next studies. Additionally, the employment of the data analyses presented in this study, applied to in situ SAXS measurements, could facilitate even more studies of kinetic and mechanism of COF assembly in the future.", "Taking into account the designed materials RIO-11, RIO-12 and RIO-13, alongside their extent characterization studies, the evaluation of these COFs in straightforward and well established applications, such as gas capture and heterogeneous catalysis, is the next logical step to further explore the extent of the functionalities, robustness and versatility of hydroxybenzene-based COFs.", "Part III Applications", "5 Hydroxybenzene-based COFs for CO 2Cap-", "ture", "5.1 Introduction", "The global temperature has been increasing for the last 250 years, mostly due to anthropogenic activities that lead to greenhouse gas emissions.

CO 2is naturally present in the atmosphere as a part of the biological carbon cycle, but human activities, mainly combustion of fossil fuels for energy and transportation, are altering this cycle by adding a huge amount of CO 2in the atmosphere (BATTIN et al., 2009). This worldwide concern has led nations to unite over the Paris Agreement and collectively propose to lower the greenhouse emissions in order to keep the global warming below 2 °C, though this measure is occasionally undermined by the political debates of sustainable economic development while providing enough food and energy for the global population (ROGELJ et al., 2016). Nonetheless, it is imperative the reduction and mitigation of global emissions by the multilateral implementation of the National Climate Action Plans (INDCs), which include the development of new technologies to achieve the 2030 Agenda on Sustainable Development (EUROPEAN COMMISSION SEC- RETARIAT GENERAL, EUROPEAN UNION, 2015). In view of this challenge, Carbon Capture and Sequestration (CCS) technologies have been investigated extensively, and the search for the more eﬃcient, durable and low-cost CCS materials is an ongoing topic of research (RIAHI et al., 2004; OLAJIRE, 2010; MONDAL; BALSORA; VARSHNEY, Among the CCS technologies, aqueous amine solution is vastly utilized for CO 2 capture from the ﬂue gas of the coal-ﬁred power plants, which account for over a third of the global electricity generation worldwide. However, its main drawbacks are strong corrosion of equipment vessels and the high costs of recyclability. The latter is attributed to the energy-demanding regeneration process, that occurs at temperatures around 100- 120 °C and generates a substantial eﬃciency penalty for the power plants (GOTO; YOGO; HIGASHII, 2013). Due to easier regeneration and substantial uptake capacities, porous materials have been considered powerful candidates for CCS applications (RONCONI; SANTOS, 2014; MELLO et al., 2011; SANTOS et al., 2015). Their chemical robustness, pore surface engineering and thermal stability are additional features that improve the tuning of CO 2adsorption properties (MEGÍAS-SAYAGO et al., 2019; ZHANG et al., Chapter 5. Hydroxybenzene-based COFs for CO 2Capture 84 Zhanget al.(ZHANG et al., 2019a) showed that the N-rich 2D COFs, COF-SDU1, COF-SDU2 and COF-SDU3, exhibited CO 2uptakes up to 741 mg/g at 298 K and 45 bar, relating the importance of pore size as a determining factor for high pressure adsorption of CO2. In fact, nitrogen-based COFs prompt interest, since the presence of the CO 2-philic nitrogen allows a Lewis acid-base interaction to take place (SETHIA; SAYARI, 2015). Based on that, Huang et al.(HUANG; KRISHNA; JIANG, 2015) synthesized a series of 20 imine-linked COFs containing ethynyl functional groups. The ethynyl functionality allowed a diverse pore wall decoration and hydrophilic, hydrophobic, acid and basic unities were incorporated and evaluated towards their CO 2uptake at 1 atm, whereas the [EtNH 2]50- H2P-COF presented the highest uptake at 157 mg/g at 273 K and 82 mg/g at 298 K, respectively. Also, Li et al.(LI et al., 2015) described the microporous azine-based COF- JLU2 synthesized by condensation of hydrazine hydrate and 1,3,5-triformylphloroglucinol, this microporous material displayed a CO 2uptake up to 217 mg/g at 273 K and 1 bar, besidesmethaneandhydrogenstoragecapacityaswell.Moreover,thelatterwasreproduced by Stegbauer et al.(STEGBAUER et al., 2015) under the name of ATFG-COF with similar textural properties. This COF showed CO 2uptake capacity of 3.93 mmol/g (173 Additionally, modifying the channels by metal-doping in order to potentially increase the sorption properties did not enhance the CO 2uptake for ATFG-COF.", "In this study, the CO 2uptake capacities for the hydroxy-1,3,5-triformylbenzenes- based COFs RIO-11, RIO-12 and RIO-13 were investigated. To better represent the post-combustion conditions of the ﬂue-gas, the analyses were performed in a TGA under continuous ﬂow of CO 2. This study aims to focus on the relationship of the CO 2adsorp- tion properties with the material surface area and the presence of heteroatoms in these hydroxybenzene-based COFs.", "5.2 Methodology", "The microporous COFs RIO-11, RIO-12 and RIO-13 were investigated for the CO 2 capture study. RIO-11 was obtained in two forms: a lower surface area COF when standard synthesis conditions were used; and a higher surface area COF when a modulator was employed, named RIO-11’. Regarding the COFs used for this experiments, RIO-11 and RIO-13 were the same materials synthesized in Chapter 1, while RIO-11’ and RIO-12 were new batches employing the same synthesis conditions described in Chapter 1. Thermogravimetric CO 2adsorption-desorption experiments at 1 atm were per- formed in a TGA Q50 TA Instrument. Firstly, the samples were submitted to 1h heating at 120 °C under N 2ﬂow to clean the surface. After surface treatment, the samples were cooled down, still in the presence of N 2, until the desired temperature was reached. When Chapter 5. Hydroxybenzene-based COFs for CO 2Capture 85 such temperature was achieved, samples were isothermally exposed to a CO 2ﬂow of 30 mL/min. The hold time for CO 2adsorption was 60 min, even though complete saturation of the surface occurred before 10 min. After this step, the gas ﬂow was exchanged to N 2 under the same temperature of CO 2adsorption for the hold time of 10-20 minutes. After that, samples were heated until 120 °C under N 2ﬂow (10 °C/min). Additional adsorption experiments employed concentrations of 10%, 20%, 50% and 100% of CO 2in N 2, which are commercially available in these pre-mixed concentrations. The recyclability test was performed under a 100% CO 2ﬂow at 40 °C.", "5.3 Results and Discussion", "Based on the nitrogen rich nature of RIO-11’, RIO-11, RIO-12 and RIO-13, these azine-based COFs are good candidates for CO 2capture applications. These materials were submitted to thermogravimetric CO 2adsorption experiments under ﬂow conditions to better reproduce post-combustion conditions (40 °C and ambient pressure). Figure 35a shows the CO 2adsorption isotherms at 1 atm and 40 °C for RIO-11’, RIO-11, RIO-12 and RIO-13, whereas their maximum uptakes are reported in Figure 35b. It is well known that the surface area has a great impact on the adsorption of CO 2among COF materials (FURUKAWA; YAGHI, 2009; ZHAO et al., 2016; ZHANG et al., 2019a; ZENG; ZOU; ZHAO, 2016), and in view of that, it was decided to investigate the CO 2adsorption in terms of the materials S BET.", "Figure 35: (a) Adsorption isotherms of CO 2at 40 °C and 1 atm and (b) maximum CO 2 capacity values for RIO-11’, RIO-11, RIO-12 and RIO-13.", "RIO-11’, RIO-11, RIO-12 and RIO-13 present BET surface area (S BET) of 961 m2/g, 242 m2/g, 804 m2/g and 1205 m2/g, respectively. For a better understanding, the SBETand maximum CO 2uptake of RIO-11 were taken as the reference for the following discussion. For RIO-13, the S BETincrease of 5 times results in a CO 2adsorption increment of a 4.2-fold (25 mg/g). Regarding RIO-12, the S BETincrease of 3.3 times represents a CO 2 Chapter 5. Hydroxybenzene-based COFs for CO 2Capture 86 uptake boost of 2.7-fold (16.2 mg/g). However, when a modulator is used in the synthesis of RIO-11, the resulting material RIO-11’ (S BET= 961 m2/g) presents maximum CO 2 uptake of only 10 mg/g, 1.7 times the CO 2adsorption of the pristine RIO-11, despite the 4-fold increase in the S BET. Thus, plotting the maximum CO 2uptake versus the S BETfor these COFs (Figure 36a), there is a linear correlation among RIO-11, RIO-12 and RIO-13, but not for RIO-11’. Indeed, when the Pearson’s correlation coeﬃcient was calculated for RIO-11, RIO-12 and RIO-13, it aﬀorded the rvalue of 0.99856, conﬁrming the strong dependence of the surface area for CO 2adsorption for those materials. As for RIO-11’, the SBET-CO 2adsorption relationship does not follows the previous trend, since the increase of a 4-fold in the S BETwould have indicated a maximum CO 2capacity of a value closer to 20 mg/g (Figure 35a, grey). This clearly indicates that the surface area is relevant in these nitrogen-rich microporous materials regarding CO 2adsorption, however, it is not the sole factor that acts upon the studied COFs. The relatively lower number of hydroxyl groups in RIO-11’ – in relation to RIO-12 and RIO-13 – may be setting a threshold for its maximum CO 2capacity.", "Figure 36: (a) Plot of BET surface area versus maximum CO 2capacity and (b) chemical structure of the framework for RIO-11’/RIO-11, RIO-12 and RIO-13.", "In fact, the inﬂuence of the hydroxyl group in CO 2capture has been reported in the literature for a range of materials with this application (DANON; STAIR; WEITZ, 2011; MANCHADO et al., 1994; NANAYAKKARA; LARISH; GRASSIAN, 2014; YOU et al., 2008; YUE et al., 2008). The presence of polar groups in conjugated microporous organic polymers was shown to be eﬀective in CO 2capture (DAWSON; ADAMS; COOPER, 2011), where incorporation of hydroxyl groups would be the main reason for adsorption enhancement, following the tendency of the alike modiﬁcation in MOF MIL-53 derivatives (TORRISI; BELL; MELLOT-DRAZNIEKS, 2010). Likewise, Serre et al.(SERRE et al., 2007) showed that the very large breathing mode during CO 2adsorption-desorption experiments for the MOF MIL-53 was partially due to -OH ···O=C=O interactions. These Chapter 5. Hydroxybenzene-based COFs for CO 2Capture 87 interactions were investigated by IR spectroscopy and they were studied based on the signiﬁcant perturbation of the stretching and the bending modes of the hydroxyl groups upon CO 2adsorption, which were validated by periodic DFT calculations. Additionally, according to Yang et al.(YANG et al., 2012a), hydroxyl groups present within the pore can bind selectively to CO 2through the formation of moderate -OH ···O=C=O hydrogen bonds, as reported for MOF NOTT-300 and detected by in situ PXRD and inelastic neutron scattering studies. In this manner, hydroxyl groups were already demonstrated to function as adsorption sites in porous materials, due to either hydrogen bonds or Lewis acid-base interactions.", "Figure 37: Smallest Repetitive Unit (SRU) of COFs RIO-11, RIO-12 and RIO-13. Considering that RIO-11’, RIO-11, RIO-12 and RIO-13 bear the same azine framework and that the major diﬀerence among them, besides the BET surface area, is the number of hydroxyl groups within the pore (Figure 36b), it is reasonable to consider the inﬂuence of this interaction regarding their CO 2adsorption properties. This could justify the diﬀerence between the values of experimental and expected results for the maximum CO2uptake for RIO-11’. When the S BETof RIO-11 is increased from 242 m2/g to 961 m2/g in RIO-11’, there is only an increase of 1.7-fold in the CO 2adsorption. This constraint can be due to the lessen number of -OH binding sites in RIO-11’, thus limiting the degree of hydroxyl-CO 2interactions for this material. Thus, the molar quantities of COF and the molar adsorbed quantity of CO 2were compared in order to evaluate this hypothesis. Firstly, since the uptake capacities are shown in milligram of CO 2by gram of COF, those values were transformed to their molar values. For the COFs, their smallest repetitive unit (SRU, Figure 37) were taken as a reference (Table 8). Then, these molar values of SRU and CO 2uptake were normalized in function of their respective SRU, aﬀording the mmols of CO 2that are adsorbed by one mmol of SRU, namely the speciﬁc CO 2uptake (Table 9). In order to analyze the sole inﬂuence of the chemical structure of the COFs on the CO 2uptake capacity, RIO-11’ was taken into consideration instead of RIO-11, since the S BETof the former comes closer to the theoretical value (MAIA et al., 2018). Using this strategy, it was expected to better minimize the signiﬁcant inﬂuence of the speciﬁc surface area in CO 2adsorption and focus on the chemical structure features per se. In Chapter 5. Hydroxybenzene-based COFs for CO 2Capture 88 Table 8: CO 2uptake as a function of the smallest repetitive unit (SRU) of COFs in a molar basis.", "COF SRU mmol of SRU CO 2uptake (mg) CO 2uptake (mmol) (g/mol) per1 g of COF per1 g of COF per1 g of COF Table 9: CO 2uptake (mmol/mmol SRU) and experimental and theoretical S BETof COFs.

Taking ﬁrstly RIO-11 as a reference, the CO 2uptake triplicates when the number of hydroxyl groups doubles in RIO-12, and it increases a 5-fold when the number of hydroxyl groups triplicates, demonstrating an increase of CO 2adsorption along with an increase of the number of hydroxyl groups but no linear correlation between those factors. This can be due to the fact that RIO-11 reaches only 14% of its theoretical S BETvalue probably due to defects in its the structure, which can interfere in gas sorption. In order to minimize those features, RIO-11’ was then evaluated towards its CO 2adsorption, since it attains 56% of its theoretical S BET, resembling more a defect-free structure than RIO-11, where RIO-11’ is less biased towards this factor. Hence, it was observed that the CO 2uptake capacity doubles from RIO-11’ to RIO-12 and triplicates from RIO-11 to RIO-13, therefore demonstrating that at each increase of the hydroxyl group in the SRU, the CO 2uptake increases accordingly (Figure 38). Besides that, taking into account that each pore is theoretically formed by 6 unities of SRU, 2 molecules of CO 2would be captured at each 2, 5 and 8 pores from a single layer of RIO-13, RIO-12 and RIO-11’, respectively. This would be in alignment with the ﬁndings of Huang et al.(HUANG; KRISHNA; Chapter 5. Hydroxybenzene-based COFs for CO 2Capture 89 Figure 38: Speciﬁc CO 2uptake of COFs RIO-11’, RIO-12 and RIO-13.", "JIANG, 2015), where the porphyrin-based [EtOH] X-H2P-COFs presented enhanced CO 2 capacities when higher contents of hydroxyl groups were incorporated. At the moment, theoretical calculations, performed by BSc. Felipe de Oliveira, are under course in our group to better understand the preferential adsorption site for these materials. Early results, which can be found in the Materials and Methods part, initially indicates the preferential interaction of acidic CO 2with the electron pair of the oxygen atom in the phenol derivative scaﬀold of RIO-13. Additionally, physisorption most probably takes place, as the theoretical enthalpy of adsorption lies in the range of -20 kJ/mol. Based on periodic DFT calculations (PBE-D3) an optimized structure of CO 2interacting with the framework RIO-13 was achieved, shown in Figure 39, demonstrating that the proposed interaction is supported by DFT calculations.", "Figure 39: Optimized structure of CO 2interacting with the framework RIO-13 by DFT calculations.", "Chapter 5. Hydroxybenzene-based COFs for CO 2Capture 90 Among the tested materials, RIO-13 presented the best result for CO 2capture at 40 °C and 1 atm. It is noticeable the diﬀerence in the maximum CO 2uptake when comparing RIO-13 (25.0 mg/g) with COF-JLU2 (217 mg/g at 273 K and 1 bar) (LI et al., 2015) and ATGF-COF (82 mg/g at 40 °C and 1 atm) (STEGBAUER et al., 2015), although they are made from the same building blocks. The adsorption values for COF-JLU2 and ATFG-COF were not obtained under the same thermogravimetric conditions of RIO- 13, which better describe post-combustion conditions, and therefore cannot be directly compared. Indeed, when ATFG-COF was tested under a thermogravimetric ﬂow, it was reported CO 2adsorption up to 1.5 mmol/g (66 mg/g) at 30 °C and up to 0.8 mmol/g (35 mg/g) at 50 °C (STEGBAUER et al., 2015). In this manner, these values are in agreement with our ﬁndings, considering that diﬀerent CO 2ﬂow rates were used in the experiments of RIO-13 (30 mL/min) and ATFG-COF (16 mL/min), and that a higher ﬂow allows part of the gas to pass through the adsorbent without getting adsorbed (MUNUSAMY et al., To further investigate this material towards this application, the adsorption tem- perature and gas concentration were investigated, considering the diluted nature of the post-combustion CO 2ﬂow. For the latter, diﬀerent concentrations of the gas were employed: 100%, 50%, 20% and 10% of CO 2in N 2. For these concentrations, RIO-13 presented maxi- mum gas uptake capacity of 25.0 mg/g, 15.9 mg/g, 13.9 mg/g and 7.7 mg/g, respectively (Figure 40a), where the maximum gas uptake decreases with the decrease of CO 2concen- tration. Interestingly, the maximum gas capacity was shown to be very similar for the CO 2 concentrations of 50% (15.5 mg/g) and 20% (13.9 mg/g). Under the CO 2concentration of 100%, the adsorption temperatures were evaluated in terms of the maximum CO 2capacity for RIO-13. The temperatures investigated were 40 °C, 60 °C, 80 °C and 100 °C (Figure 40b), whereas temperatures lower than 40 °C could not be measured due to the limitations of this technique. When the experiment was performed at 40 °C, the maximum experimental adsorption uptake of 25.0 mg/g was observed. Hence, when the adsorption temperatures were 60 °and 80 °C, the maximum CO 2uptakes were 12.6 mg/g and 4.0 mg/g, respectively. Additionally, no adsorption was observed when the temperature was 100 °C. Therefore, the CO2adsorption capacity increases with the decrease of the temperature for RIO-13. As it happens for most physisorption cases (LI et al., 2015; GOMES; BHANJA; BHAUMIK, 2015; PATEL et al., 2014), a lower adsorption temperature leads to a higher CO 2uptake due to less kinetic energy attributed to the adsorbed gas. This diﬀerence in energy makes it is less probable that the gas at a lower temperature can escape the material surface more readily, especially when physisorption takes place.", "In addition, three times adsorption-desorption cycles were performed to evaluate the recyclability of RIO-13 (Figure 41). In order to promote the desorption, no additional heat was necessary to desorb the CO 2, which was simply liberated from the COF surface, isothermally at 40 °C, when the CO 2ﬂow was replaced by N 2. After 3 cycles, the material Chapter 5. Hydroxybenzene-based COFs for CO 2Capture 91 Figure 40: (a) Plot of CO 2concentration versus the maximum CO 2capacity and (b) plot of adsorption temperature versus the maximum CO 2capacity, both for RIO-13. showed no signiﬁcant loss in CO 2uptake and demonstrated easy regeneration. This characteristic is attributed to physisorption between the RIO-13 and the CO 2molecules, which are responsible for fully reversible isotherms in an “easy-on/easy-oﬀ” system (YANG et al., 2012a). The cost-eﬀective recovery of RIO-13 is a signiﬁcant feature of this material, especially when compared with the costly regeneration of the current used amine-based CCS materials (HASZELDINE, 2009).", "Figure 41: Recyclability test for CO 2adsorption for COF RIO-13 at 40 °C and 1 atm.", "5.4 Conclusion", "In this study, RIO-11, RIO-11’, RIO-12 and RIO-13 were employed in CO 2capture.

Additionally,thepresenceofheteroatoms,suchasOandN,grantintramolecularinteraction between these atoms and acidic CO 2. Particularly, it was found a strong relationship between the surface area of COFs and their CO 2capture. Subtle inﬂuences seem to be Chapter 5. Hydroxybenzene-based COFs for CO 2Capture 92 the hydroxyl eﬀect: an increasing number of hydroxyl groups, considering the smallest repetitive unit of COFs, led to a increase in the speciﬁc CO 2uptake values. Although theoretical calculations are still in course to better understand the adsorption sites, the presence of heteroatoms – specially hydroxyl groups – seem to be an underlying factor on CO2capture in this case. Hence, it would be interesting to test other microporous COFs, which bear their walls decorated with hydroxyl moieties, in order to investigate if their CO 2uptake capacities increase as a function of these functional groups, as it does for The experimental conditions used in this study, CO 2ﬂow at 40 °C, better represent the ﬂue gas post-combustion conditions when comparing with traditional equilibrium analyses, although the former presents lower gas uptake values due to the dynamic nature of the method. RIO-13 presented the higher CO 2uptake capacity among the tested materials, mostly due to its higher speciﬁc surface area. This material was also evaluated towards diﬀerent gas concentrations and adsorption temperatures, whereas the best result is associated with higher concentration of CO 2and a lower temperature, namely 100% of CO2at 40 °C. RIO-13 presented excellent recyclability, essentially holding up its adsorption capacity through three cycles. The complete regeneration occurred at the end of each cycle, once the CO 2ﬂow was exchanged by N 2ﬂow, isothermally at 40 °C. Finally, the CO2uptake capacities for these materials have the potential to be further improved, but it is expected that this work contributes to the development and improvement of new CO 2 adsorbent materials, which would feature similar chemical moieties as discussed in this study.", "6 Nickel Based-COFs for Heterogeneous", "Catalysis", "6.1 Introduction", "The use of COF as a heterogeneous platform for catalysis is relatively recent: the ﬁrst application of COFs in catalysis was only reported in 2011 by Ding et al.(DING et al., 2011). They described the incorporation of Pd(II) into the 2D imine-based scaﬀold COF-LZU1, which was applied in Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling reactions. Excellent yields, high catalytic activity and easy recyclability have been achieved with Pd/COF-LZU1, but the exposure to harsh conditions and long reaction times diminished the structural regularity of the material. In 2016, Gonçalves et al.(GONÇALVES et al., 2016) reported that Pd(OAc) 2@COF-300 behaves as an eﬀective heterogeneous catalyst with excellent catalytic activity for phosphine-free Suzuki-Miyaura, Heck and Sonogashira cross-coupling reactions at low palladium loadings (0.1 mol% Pd). In a similar fashion, Mu et al.(MU et al., 2017) demonstrated that Cu-COFHX and Cu-COFDMF, both Cu(II)-containing COFs with imine linkers, exhibited high activities toward the selective oxidation of styrene to benzaldehyde. Additionally, Zhao et al.(ZHAO; WU, 2017) described the synthesis of COF CPF-2, a porphyrinic framework, which showed high eﬃciency and selectivity for the aerobic epoxidation of alkenes under mild conditions after the coordination of Co(II) ions.1 Nevertheless, suitable COF candidates for catalytic applications must show high stability to thermal treatments, water, and organic solvents (HAN et al., 2018), and should incorporate robust catalytic active sites (MU et al., 2017). Easy access to the latter and eﬃcient mass transport within the porous catalyst should also be guaranteed for an ideal catalytic performance (DING; WANG, 2013). In contrast to the well-known boron-containing COFs linked by boroxine or boronate-ester groups, triazole-, imine-, and hydrazone-based COF materials present the stability characteristics stated previously and thus meet the requirements expected for robust heterogeneous catalysts (DING et al., 2011). Moreover, Schiﬀ bases have played a central role as chelating ligands in coordination chemistry and are versatile in incorporating a variety of metal ions (SINGH et al., 2002; ABDEL-LATIF; HASSIB; ISSA, 2007).", "This factors were motivating to explore the possibility of using an imine-linked metal-ion-incorporated COF material for heterogeneous catalysis. In particular, in a 1A manuscript based on this chapter was submitted for publication in Chemistry - A European Journal and it was accepted on November 19thof 2019 ( Chem. Eur. J. 10.1002/chem.201904845). Chapter 6.

RIO- 13 was not the ﬁrst choice for this application due to the presence of both tautomers. Although theoretical calculations suggested a framework with alternating tautomers in a 1:1 proportion (STEGBAUER et al., 2015), RIO-12 was still preferred due to its established chemical structure that favors chelation of metals. Moreover, RIO-12 was still preferred over RIO-11 due to the higher number of potential binding sites of the former. Thus, the strategy was to adopt a post-synthetic modiﬁcation (PSM) of the potential catalytic sites into the COF skeleton in order to avoid the undesired eﬀect of harsh solvothermal conditions during metal incorporation (HU et al., 2018).", "Despite the skyrocketing use of palladium in numerous catalytic systems over the past half-century, its high cost and relatively small earth abundance is a drawback when comparing it to other transition metals. Indeed, there is a trend to move towards greener chemistry by using more abundant, less toxic, non-precious and less expensive metal catalysts. In this context, Buarque et al.(CIFUENTES et al., 2018) recently described an iron-based covalent organic framework, FeCl 3@TPB-DMTP-COF, that can eﬃciently promote the decarboxylative cross-coupling of cinnamic acids. Likewise, nickel, the 3d sibling of palladium, outstands as an excellent choice when it comes to a more sustainable metal catalyst (HAN, 2013; TASKER; STANDLEY; JAMISON, 2014; ANANIKOV, 2015; HENRION; RITLENG; CHETCUTI, 2015; RITLENG; HENRION; CHETCUTI, 2016).", "However, it should not be simply considered as an inexpensive alternative to palladium, but rather as an element presenting key properties that complement catalysis of other transition metals. Since nickel is a relatively electropositive transition metal, oxidative additions occur quite easily. Thus, the key advantage of Ni-based catalysts over Pd systems lies in their ability to activate aryl chlorides (CIFUENTES et al., 2018), aryl ﬂuorides (TASKER; STANDLEY; JAMISON, 2014), sulfonates (CHEN; YANG, 2007), aromatic nitriles and phenol derivatives (TASKER; STANDLEY; JAMISON, 2014) in cross-coupling reactions without the need of electron-rich and expensive ligands (CHEN; YANG, 2007). Nickel also has a wider range of oxidation states commonly invoked in catalysis. Even if Ni(0)/Ni(II) catalytic cycles are widespread, the easy accessibility of Ni(I) and Ni(III) oxidation states allows radical pathways, and thus diﬀerent modes of reactivity. Additionally, nickel gains recognition because it is less susceptible to β-hydride-elimination relative to palladium (TASKER; STANDLEY; JAMISON, 2014). In practical terms, the price of nickel in its elemental form is approximately 3,000 times lower than palladium, which now exceeds the price of gold on a kg-for-kg basis.", "Concerning nickel anchored in COFs, research is still in its infancy. The ﬁrst example of metalating a 3D COF with Ni was achieved by stirring DBA-3D-COF with 10 wt% Ni(COD) 2in toluene (BALDWIN et al., 2016). The resulting Ni-DBA-3D-COF displays great uptake capacities for ethane and ethylene. In 2016, the emergence of COFs as supports Chapter 6. Nickel Based-COFs for Heterogeneous Catalysis 95 for electro-catalysts was revealed. Supporting Ni 3N nanoparticles on a π-conjugated N-rich COF gave rise to lower band gap nanocomposites serving as excellent electro-catalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) from water (NANDI et al., 2016). Shortly afterwards, covalent triazine frameworks with 2.8 wt% Ni2+loadings were applied as catalysts in the oligomerization of ethylene under mild conditions (15 bar at 50 °C) (ROZHKO et al., 2017). These porous aromatic frameworks exhibited similar catalytic activities compared to those of their homogeneous analogues and a ﬁvefold higher selectivity to long-chain oleﬁns. Encouraged by these promising results of nickel-based COF catalysts, the attention was turned on exploring the COF RIO-12 topology for nickel-catalysed Suzuki-Miyaura aryl-aryl cross-coupling, a powerful tool to construct C-C bonds (WANG et al., 2015; CHEN; YANG, 2007) and a relevant reaction for the synthesis of several drugs. The nickel(II)-coordinated COF material (denoted NiCl@RIO-12) was easily synthesized by reﬂuxing RIO-12 with NiCl 2in ethanol in the presence of K 2CO 3. Ni(II)-incorporation in the resulting NiCl@RIO-12 was veriﬁed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and a homogeneous Ni-dispersion throughout the framework was established by scanning electronmicroscopy(SEM)andhighresolutiontransmissionelectronmicroscopy(HRTEM), both coupled with energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDS). The designed material NiCl@RIO-12 was applied as a heterogeneous catalyst for Suzuki-Miyaura reactions under microwave conditions between 4’-bromoacetophenone and phenylboronic acid with nickel loadings as low as 0.2 mol%.

In order to investigate and optimize the complexation reaction of the nickel into the framework of RIO-12, a model compound approach was employed. The use of a small molecule that can closely represent the chemical structure of the framework, in theory, indeed allows the rapid characterization of the resulting complex by conventional techniques, in spite of the time-consuming characterization of COFs and related materials. Considering the structure of RIO-12, a α-imine-phenol moiety was the obvious choice for the model compound (Figure 42), and the synthetic equivalent, salicylideneaniline (SAH), was thus chosen, due to the readily available starting materials: salicylaldehyde and aniline. On that basis, SAH was reacted with nickel dichloride in order to aﬀord NiL n@SA, and an optimization study was conducted concerning the base and the solvent. The optimized conditions were then employed on RIO-12 to aﬀord the product NiCl@RIO-12.", "The various reaction conditions used to obtain a model complex NiL n@SA are summarized in Table 10. The model compound salicylideneaniline (SAH) was initially reacted with the anhydrous nickel salt in methanol at 65 °C (ABDEL-LATIF; HASSIB; ISSA, 2007). However, only the starting material was detected by1H NMR spectroscopy of the reaction medium after 24 h reaction (entry 1).

This showed that the deprotonation of the phenol moiety is necessary to enable the complex formation, even though similar complexations have been reported to occur without a base (SIBOUS et al., 2010; DOLAZ; TÜMER; DIĞRAK, 2004; DAMAVANDI et al., 2015). Bearing entry 2 as the best result in methanol, the screening of diﬀerent reaction solvents was next performed.", "Regarding this latter point, it is noteworthy that, since the optimized reaction conditions will be used in a COF, solvent surface tension must be taken into account.

However, a solvent with a high surface tension will adhere by capillarity to the pore walls and will either (i) be trapped into the pores or (ii) collapse the framework due to structural deformation during solvent evacuation (HOWARTH et al., 2016). For that matter, solvents with a high surface tension such as DMSO (42.9 dynes/cm) were avoided, and solvents with a milder surface tension (22-28 dynes/cm), such as methanol, ethanol, toluene, THF and dichloromethane were preferred (YAWS, 2008).", "When the reaction was performed in toluene (entry 4), the reaction presented itself as a suspension at all times and no product was formed.

The XPS spectra of the Ni 2p and Cl 2p regions of NiL n@SA are shown in Figure 47a,b and the binding energies (BE) are detailed in Table 11. The presence of the 2p3/2, 2p 1/2peaks and their respective satellites conﬁrms that the nickel present in the surface of the material is paramagnetic at a molecular level, due to unpaired spins of the d8nickel conﬁguration, but it would be necessary to analyze its magnetization curve to verify if the paramagnetic behavior is reﬂected on the bulk. Based on the Russell-Saunders selection rules for nickel compounds, the spin-orbit coupling is forbidden in diamagnetic compounds, but it is allowed in paramagnetic compounds, which leads to the transition BE associated with these satellites. This allowed transition is related to the shake-up transition between 3d and 4s orbitals (MATIENZO et al., 1973). Furthermore, the similar BE of the 2p peaks and their satellites for NiCl 2and NiL n@SA clearly indicate a Ni2+ species in the material surface (Table 11) (DAVIDSON et al., 1996). Finally, the presence of a nickel-bonded chlorine atom in the NiL n@SA can be justiﬁed by the characteristic Ni-Cl BE for this atom (Figure 47b). On these bases, a K[Ni(SA)Cl 2] or [Ni(SA)Cl(L)] (where L = solvent or H 2O) formulation can reasonably be proposed for the monomeric form of the obtained model compound NiL n@SA. Unfortunately, elemental analyses could not conﬁrm either of these formulations and no single crystals could be obtained to conﬁrm (or inﬁrm) this hypothesis by X-ray diﬀraction crystallography, most probably because of the presence of dimeric and oligomeric forms, as shown by ESI-HRMS.", "Chapter 6.

Importantly, despite the slight decrease in activity observed for the 3rd run, a hot ﬁltration test revealed no nickel leaching into the solution, therefore conﬁrming the heterogeneous nature of the catalyst. Although no mechanistic studies were performed, it is proposed that this Suzuki–Miyaura cross-coupling undergoes through a Ni0to Ni(II) cycle (Figure 55), similar to the palladium catalyzed version (MIYAURA et al., 1985). Brieﬂy, the oxidative addition of the aryl halides to Ni0generates a Ni(II)species, followed by transmetallation of the Ni(II)intermediate, which undergoes through a reductive elimination, aﬀording the coupled product and regenerating the active Ni0(HAN, 2013).

Similar reaction conditions were used to incorporate nickel in various amounts in the framework of RIO-12. The resulting nickel-decorated COFs preserved their crystallinity, as shown by powder XRD, and higher loadings of nickel in general led to lower BET surface areas. Moreover, the incorporation of nickel was relatively homogeneous and no agglomeration was detected by SEM-EDS or HRTEM- EDS. Furthermore, the paramagnetic nature of NiCl@RIO-12a-f was established by XPS. NiCl@RIO-12e was applied in Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling reactions under microwave radiation for 15 minutes. Though its catalytic activity was moderate, it was recyclable and showed no nickel leaching, which makes of it a superior catalyst than the homogeneous model catalyst.", "Considering that nickel-functionalized COFs are still in their infancy, as well as the importance of employing earth abundant metals over precious metals as catalysts, it is expected that this study will highlight that nickel-functionalized COFs have the potential of being employed in heterogeneous catalysis. The stable nickel-COF bond, its homogeneous dispersion throughout the framework, its recyclability and the absence of leaching are factors that make this kind of material promising for a variety of applications in catalysis, and it is expected a bright future for Ni@COF materials.

Thereby, COFs stand out alongside other porous materials due to their high thermal stability (WALLER; GÁNDARA; YAGHI, 2015) and high surface area (KARAK et al., 2017), besides pore tuning (MA et al., 2016) and framework design (CAI et al., 2016). Currently, most reports of COFs (XU et al., 2016) and MOFs (FRACAROLI et al., 2016) in the literature pursue tuning their functionalities applications by attachment of a new molecular fragment in the already formed structure by post-synthetic modiﬁcation (PSM). However, the framework presents itself monotonic in all its extension, due to the molecular fragment repetition along the structure. In that fashion, it would be interesting to design a porous material which walls could be decorated with diverse molecular fragments in an ordered manner, so that the design of these structures would reach heterogeneity within order (FURUKAWA; MÜLLER; YAGHI, 2015).", "Components of biological systems, such as proteins, enzymes and DNA, are struc- tured by one-dimensional backbones that would be monotonic and repetitive in case its building blocks did not bear a variety of side chains. Actually, the beauty in those systems relies on its backbone decoration, whose ordered sequence leads to coded information. However, there is still a long way towards synthesizing nanostructures that would resemble the simplest biological systems, though nature design could inspire novel COFs. One alter- native would be to mimic the chemical environment of biological systems into more robust structures (LILLERUD; OLSBYE; TILSET, 2010). Due to its fully organic structure, COFs are excellent candidates for the synthesis of these bioinspired materials. Employing the same concept in COFs, but rather using its monotonic 2D or 3D framework decorated with diﬀerent side chains/groups, would allow combining function and information into frameworks in a much higher density, considering that each crystallographic plane would bear diﬀerent information (Figure 56).", "Besides that, the use of amino acids or related structures as COFs building blocks would theoretically allow to incorporate their diﬀerent side chains within the pore (Fig- ure 56), possibly recreating a chiral recognition environment, which would be an important step towards supramolecular catalysis. This “decoration” of the pores is diﬀerent from other approaches, such as post-synthetic modiﬁcations (XU; GAO; JIANG, 2015) or metallation (WECKHUYSEN et al., 1996), since the molecular fragments would be ho- Chapter 7.

Therefore, the proposal towards designing bioinspired COFs is to design initially a material containing an amino acid residue covalently bonded within the framework, which could potentially achieve the before mentioned applications.

By this strategy, fast nucleation was avoided. When COF was prepared with the use of aniline (6) (6 equiv.) as modulator, the precipitation was not sudden, taking several hours until a precipitate was perceived. Conversely, when the reaction was performed without aniline (6), an amorphous material was obtained. Furthermore, the N-protection was essential to COF formation: when this functional groups was not protected, an amorphous material was always obtained, probably due to the high reactivity of the free amine.

The infrared spectra of materials RIO-30a-d were very similar, as an example, RIO-30b infrared spectra will be discussed. Analysis of the FTIR of RIO-30b (Figure 58), showed the absence of the peak in 2882 cm-1, related to the Fermi resonance of the aldehyde building block (TFF), indicating that the aldehyde is no longer present in RIO-30. Additionally, shift of the carbonyl peak from 1690 cm-1 from the building block 13b, to 1625 cm-1, in RIO-30, indicated the formation of the C=N bond (URIBE-ROMO et al., 2009).", "Figure 58: Comparison of infrared spectra of RIO-30, and its building blocks TFF and Powder X-Ray Diﬀraction (PXRD) of the materials RIO-30a-d showed the crys- talline nature of these compounds.

Thus, small molecules can assemble into complex structures depending on their connectivity and degree of interaction within the frame- work. Likewise, inspiration in such systems could aﬀord interesting structures, multiple functionalities and coding of information.", "In this study, it was attempted to synthesize Covalent Organic Frameworks employ- ing amino acids as starting materials. Initially, building blocks were designed and prepared from the amino acids glycin, L-alanine, L-valine and L-phenylalanine and reacted with the well established 1,3,5-triformylphenol to potentially aﬀord the COFs RIO-30a-d. RIO-30a and RIO-30b were the materials which attained higher crystallinity among the prepared frameworks, whereas only the latter was indeed a porous material with a relevant speciﬁc surface area and with a rod- likemorphology, detected by SEM. Unfortunatelly, it was not possible to fully validate the structure of the formed materials, although decomposition of the building blocks 13a-d is a considered hypotesis. Nevertheless, the assemble of such complex structures should not be underestimated, and certainly further studies are neces- sary to elucidate their possible synthesis mechanism and to attain the ideal conditions for the synthesis of the, unfortunately still elusive, amino acid-based COFs. Part V Conclusions and Perspectives Chapter 7. Design of Amino acid-based COFs 128 In view of the topics investigated throughout this study, the following questions can be answered and some perspectives can be contemplated:", "(i)Is it possible to use inexpensive building blocks in the synthesis of new COF materials?", "Yes, It is possible to use inexpensive building blocks. The design and synthesis of the new COFs RIO-11 and RIO-12, inspired by the already reported RIO-13, was demonstrated in this Thesis. Phenol derivatives can be successfully used as tripodal building blocks, thus behaving as versatile aﬀordable molecules to be employed in the synthesis of such materials. Moreover, the yields from the formylation step were improved in relation of what was reported in the literature (CHONG et al., 2003), thus these new synthesis conditions could enable the scale up of such COFs and pave the way for potential large scale applications; (ii)Which structural factors of the building blocks are important for COF formation and how COFs are aﬀected by those factors?", "In the case of RIO-11, RIO-12 and RIO-13, the conformational locks within those COFs aﬀord a more symmetric, and therefore more crystalline, material. The probable presence of the intramolecular hydrogen bonds minimize possible diﬀerent conformations that may arise in COF linkages: the higher the number of hydrogen bonds, the higher the number of conformational locks within the COF linkages, aﬀording a material of higher symmetry. When those interactions alone are not suﬃcient to improve the textural properties, a modulator approach can be used instead, avoiding fast nucleation and forming a crystalline material as well. Thus, this systematic study of hydroxybenzene-based COFs could potentially be applied to other classes of COFs, allowing better understanding of thoses systems and avoiding the serendipity related to their resulting textural properties. Although the presence of hydrogen bonds could not be undoubtedly proven due to the absence of a single crystal to elucidate the chemical structure of these COFs, it is expected that the challenge to its attainment from COF materials can be overcome to conﬁrm our ﬁndings in a elucidated chemical structure of RIO-11, RIO-12 and RIO-13. Additionally, SAXS studies also revealed statistical textural information about COFs. These are mainly attributed to the smooth surface of the studied microporous COFs and the tendency of a smoother framework surface and rougher pore interface when by post-synthetic modiﬁcations are employed in some mesoporous COFs. Further investigations concerning USAXS and WAXS could better describe micropores features and likely determine the radius of gyration of the investigated COFs.", "(iii)If new COFs built from inexpensive building blocks can be made, how can they be applied?", "The building blocks RIO-11, RIO-12 and RIO-13 were successful employed in two applications. RIO-11, RIO-12 and RIO-13 presented CO 2capture capacity, whereas RIO-13 Chapter 7. Design of Amino acid-based COFs 129 was established as the best material among these COFs. RIO-13 was tested in ﬂue gas post-combustion conditions, showing excellent recyclability up to three cycles. Furthermore, the role of the hydroxyl groups as adsorption sites are being theoretically investigated, studies which could possibly enhance the design capability towards this application. Additionally, RIO-12 presented itself as an excellent platform towards heterogeneous catalysis by an earth-abundant metal. Nickel was successfully incorporated in RIO-12 framework, demonstrating catalytic activity for Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling reactions under microwave radiation, no metal leaching was detected and it was recyclable up to three cycles. This study demonstrated that COFs are excellent candidates as heterogeneous catalysts, although the catalytic activity was moderate for the studied case, other metals could possibly be investigated for a myriad of catalytic reactions employing COF materials. (iv)Can complexity be introduced in the COF framework by employing amino acids as starting materials for the building blocks?", "Heterogeneity within order was attempted as a proof of concept in this Thesis by employing non-symmetrical amino acid derivatives as building blocks for COF formation. Glycine, L-alanine, L-valine and L-phenylalanine were employed in this synthesis, alongside 1,3,5-triformylphenol, to potentially aﬀord the amino acid-based COFs RIO-30a-d, which were not yet obtained. A porous and crystalline material (RIO-30b) was prepared, which could not be fully elucidated yet. In view of that, a possible decomposition of the amino acid derivative building blocks, during COF synthesis, is being currently investigated. Finally, research is still ongoing towards obtaining such bioinspired COFs, in which the proposed design inspired by nature can be ﬁnally achieved by men (or women).

Objective: the main goal (1), this thesis aim s to verify the efficacy of virtual reality exposure therapy for panic disorder treatment. Secondary goals are: (2) identify neuroimaging findings predict effective psychotherapy treatment; (3) translate and validate the questionnaire panic - agoraphobia spe ctrum -self report (PAS -SR); (4) measure the consumption of caffeine in PD patients and compare to healthy controls. Method: clinical trial with PD volunteers. All patients received pharmacological treatment VRET for 8 weeks. In order to identify the predic tors of response to psychotherapy in anxiety disorders, a systematic review of neuroimaging studies was performed. Standardized methods in literature were used to translate and validate the PAS - SR. Ultimately: a survey was produced quantifying the caffeine ingestion on PD patients and in healthy volunteers in an observational study. Results: TERV has shown itself to be a safe and promising treatment for PD. Despite the small clinical sample, the results showed a significant improvement in depression symptom s in BDI (P = 0.033). There was a tendency towards the improvement of anxiety measured by ASI and the panic symptoms measured by the DSQ (P = 0.081). Our review highlighted regions such as the amygdala, insula,", "hippocampus and anterior cingulate cortex as relevant predictors of CBT’s effectiveness in anxiety disorder patients. Each domain of the PAS -SR spectrum correlates with total score and the instrument of administration in PD patients has shown significantly higher scores than healthy controls’ scores . This evidence supplies support for the validity of the panic spectrum evaluated in the PAS-SR for the Brazilian population. Our study has shown larger amounts of caffeine consumption compared to the healthy controls. The number of hours of sleep was sign ificantly smaller in PD patients, which can be a result of the anxiety disorder or the abusive use of caffeine.

Transtorno d e Pânico", "Transtornos de ansiedade estão entre os transtornos mentais mais prevalentes e entre as principais causas de incapacitação funcional implicando em elevados custos para os sistemas de saúde e para a sociedade. Dent re os transtornos de ansiedade, o transtorno do pânico é caracterizado por ataques de ansiedade recorrente s definido s por medo intenso ou desconforto que atinge seu ápice em poucos minutos com sintomas físicos e cognitivos, como palpitações, dispneia, dor no peito, tonturas, náuseas, sudorese, desrealização, medo de perder o controle e medo de morrer. (APA, 2013) O transtorno de pânico (TP) é uma patologia psiquiátrica muito comum, com prevalência ao longo da vida de", "1,5 % a 5,1% (Range & Bernik, 2001; Grant et al.,2006). A agorafobia tem prevalência de 3,4 % a 13,4 % ao longo da vida. (Range & Bernik, 2001; Goodwin et al., 2005) O TP é incapacitante, princi palmente quando associado à agorafobia, levando a um comprometimento da capacidade laborativa e redução da qualidade de vida. ( Roy-Byrne, Craske, & Stein, 2006). Pacientes com esse transtorno também tem elevado risco de suicídio , (Warshaw et al.,1995 ) por isso é importante investir no aprimoramento do manejo clínico , tratamentos inovadores e eficazes.", "1.3. Realidade Virtual", "O avanço tecnológico trouxe transformações ao campo de atuação dos psicólogos e de todos os profissionais da área de saúde . O atendimento psicoterápico vem sofrendo inovações em diversos campos de atuação e as exposições aos ambientes de realidade virtual estão entre elas . As técnicas de exposição usadas na terapia cognitivo comportamental (TCC) são intervenções tradicionais e consagradas . Sanchez -Meca et al. (2010) avaliaram diversas técnicas de TCC no tratamento do TP, dentre elas relaxamento, técnicas de respiração e exposição. Os autores concluíram que a exposição é a técnica mais eficaz para o tratamento do transtorno do pânico com agora fobia. (TPA) Estudos recentes indicam que técnicas de exposição podem ser estendidas a os ambientes virtuais com sucesso . (Carvalho, Freire & Nardi , 2008) Vários pesquisadores descrevem tratamentos utilizando técnicas de exposição à realidade virtual como p arte de tratamentos para transtornos como : fobia especifica , (Powers & Emmelkamp , 2008; Parsons & Rizzo ; 2008) fobia social , (Klinger et al. ,2005) TPA (Craske & Barlow ; 1994; Botella et al. ,2007 ; Pitti et", "al.,2008 ) e transtorno de estresse pós -traum ático . (Difede et al., 2001; Ready et Choi et al. (2005) definem a exposição à realidade virtual como uma composição dinâmica e reativa com o ambiente virtual criado por computador e usado para distintas interações humanas. Baños (2005) conceitualiza a interação com a realidade virtual como uma experiência humana avançada de comunicação de interface que proporciona ao usuário experimentar “outras realidades”. Steuner (1992) define como um ambiente real ou simulado aquele em que o sujeito sente a telepr esença, ou seja, a experiência de presença a partir de um meio de comunicação. Segundo Parsons e Rizzo (2008 ) a terapia com exposição à realidade virtual (TERV) é relativamente eficaz do ponto de vista psicoterapêutico em pacientes cuidadosamente selecion ados e pode reduzir a ansiedade e sintomas de fobia. Importante, porém ressaltar que a realidade virtual é um a estratégia incorporada a um trata mento e não um tratamento em si.", "Com o desenvolvimento de sistemas de realidade virtual, estuda -se a aplicabilid ade dessa tecnologia para a pesquisa e o tratamento do TPA. (Vincelli et al., 2001; Botella et al., 2004; Moore et al., 2002) Quando expostos a um ambiente de realidade virtual, pessoas sem transtornos psiquiátricos relatam imersão subjetiva e apresentam a umento da condutância da pele, alterações da frequência cardíaca e temperatura, evidenciando ativação objetiva . (Moore et al., 2002) Pacientes fóbicos apresentam alterações fisiológicas bem diferentes dos controles normais, mas essas diferenças tendem a di minuir com a habituação . A exposição ao ambiente virtual é bem aceita pelos pacientes e por isso também", "poderia servir como uma preparação para a exposição ao vivo . (De Carvalho, Freire & Nardi, 2010 ) Em um estudo recente , (Freire et al., 2010) , uma simul ação de ambiente virtual relevante para pacientes agorafóbicos levou a um aumento significativo da ansiedade, sintomas de pânico e alterações f isiológicas em pacientes com TPA, comparados a controles normais. Pacientes com TPA tiveram aumento de ansiedade, diversos sintomas somáticos relacionados ao TP e ataques de pânico. Além disso, também apresentaram aumento da condutância da pele, alterações da frequência cardíaca, aumento da frequência e volumes respiratórios. As principais limitações desse estudo for am o pequeno número de pacientes (Vincelli et al. , 2001 ) e o fato de a maior parte desses pacientes estar em uso de medicações eficazes para o tratamento do TP, reduzindo a sensibilidade deles ao ambiente virtual . (Freire et al., 2010) Acredita -se que indi víduos com TP também se sentiriam imersos em ambientes virtuais, e os mesmos constituiriam um tratamento eficaz, com benefícios semelhantes ao da TCC tradicional . (Botella et al. , 2004 ) No entanto mais estudos ainda são necessários para avaliar se a estimu lação em um ambiente virtual se assemelha à da exposição ao vivo, que é um dos tratamentos mais eficazes para o TPA. (Sánchez - Meca et al., 2010 ) Embora seja crescente o interesse em intervenções baseadas em realidade virtual, existe pouco respaldo teórico e de pesquisa sobre os fato res de processo e preditores de resultados nesses tratamentos , principalmente no sentido de entender se os processos terapêuticos e fatores responsáveis pela redução de sintomas na psico terapia tradicional oper am da mesma forma nas intervenções baseadas na realidade virtual.", "1.4. Relação da cafeína com os transtornos de ansiedade O consumo de cafeína pode interferir no manejo clínico do TP. A cafeína é uma das substâncias psicoativas mais consumidas no mundo. Seus efeitos incluem aumento da excitação , estado de alerta , resistência física, melhora do humor, tolerância à privação do sono e à dor, sociabilidade e bem-estar . (Fredholm et al., 1999) O elevado consumo de c afeína pode desencadear hipertensão, irritabilidade, sintomas ansioso s, insônia e complicações gestacionais. (Striley et al., 2011) Aproximadamente 80% da população mundial consome cafeína diariamente com um consumo diário médio de 76 mg . (Torres, 2009) De acordo com a Food and Drug Administration americana (http://www.fda .gov/ForConsumers/ConsumerUpdates/ucm350570.htm Assessed in November, 6, 2016) o consumo de até 400 mg de cafe ína por dia, o equivalente a quatro ou cinco xícaras de 30 ml de expressos , não representa riscos para a saúde de adultos.", "Diferentes condições m entais e clínicas são agravadas por abuso de cafeína, incluindo ansiedade, ataques de pânico e arritmia cardíaca . (Wang et al., 2015 ) Estudos relata m que o abuso de cafeína, sua toxicidade e sintomas de dependência estão associados com transtorno do pânico . (Meredith et al., 2013) Além disso, pacientes com transtorno do pânico parecem ser mais sensíveis aos efeitos da cafeína , que, por sua vez, podem provocar ataques de pânico e aumentar a ansiedade . (Yang et al., 2010) Os ataques de pânico se dão , provavel mente , devido a uma interpretação errônea das alterações fisiológicas induzidas pela cafeína . (Vilarim et al., 2011) Poucos estudos quantificaram o", "consumo de cafeína por pacientes com TP, e esses estudos não levaram em conta a quantidade de cafeína contid a em medicamentos de uso regular.", "1.5. Ativação de regiões cerebrais como preditores de e ficácia da terapia cognitivo -comportamental A TCC é considerada “padrão ouro” para tratamento psicoterápico dos transtornos ansiosos, seu objetivo é reduzir os sintomas e aumentar a habilidade de regulação emocional. (OToole et al., 2015) Embora a eficácia da TCC e de outras abordagens tenha sido demonstrada em diversos estudos clínicos , (Bandelow et al., 2015) aproximadamente, 50% dos pacientes com transtornos de ansiedade não respondem ao tratamento. (Loerinc et al., 2015 ) A neurobiologia dos transt ornos de ansiedade talvez possa trazer explicações para o fato de que muitos pacientes apresentam grande melhora com o tratamento em TCC e outros pacientes não. (Nitschke et al. , 2009) A regulação emocional proposta na TCC envolve fatores cognitivos e emocionais e os estudos de neuroimagem identificaram estruturas neurais envolvidas nesse processo. As tarefas de estímulo emocional estão geralmente associadas ao córtex pré -frontal dorsolateral (dlPFC) e cingulado dorso anterior (dACC) que são áreas corticais que pertencem ao sistema atencional e ao processo de controle executivo. (Mesina et al., 2016) A ativação dessas áreas pode ser interpretada como evidência de utilização de e stratégia de regulação emocional. (Banich et al., 2009) As áreas neurais ativadas por tarefas semânticas são a junção temporal anterior, lobo temporal anterior, córtex pré -frontal ventromedial e córtex cingulado posterior sendo que as duas últimas áreas t ambém são ativadas em", "repouso. (Binder et al., 2009) Estudos relacionam a insula e as regiões pré - frontal e estriadas as mudanças produzidas com a TCC, (Klumpp at al., 2013) o objetivo da psicoterapia em TCC é inibir a reatividade emocional e promover regulação emocional caracterizada pelo recrutamento do processo de controle cognitivo das funções executivas. (Mesina et al., 2016) Diversas funções cerebrais são essenciais para o processo de regulação emocional, e identifica r alterações em áreas relacionadas ao processo de regulação emocional pode possibilitar a identificação de preditores de resposta à psicoterapia nos transtornos de ansiedade.", "1.6. A escala Espectro Pânico -Agorafobia – Autorrelato", "Os instrumentos de rastreio e diagnóstico são muito úteis na ava lição de pacientes com transtorno de pânico . Cassano e colaboradores (1997) da Universidade de Pisa chamaram atenção para uma classificação mais abrangente do transtorno do pânico e agorafobia, que incluiria não apenas os transtornos mentais definidos pelo s manuais diagnósticos, mas também as síndromes subclínicas . Considerando que os pacientes com TP manifestam um espectro que compreende sintomas, traços e comportamentos que são mais amplos que a classificação incluíd a no DSM , o grupo de pesquisa supracita do, desenvolveu o questionário Panic -Agoraphobic Spectrum - Self Report (Espectro Pânico -Agorafobia - Autorrelato) (PAS -SR), (Cassano, 1997; Shear et al., 2002) que é um instrumento autoaplicável que avalia o espectro de pânico -agorafobia.

After all exposures, the Igroup Presence Questionnaire (IPQ) was applied to measure the sense of presence experienced in the virtual environment. The virtual environment simulated the subway o f Rio de Janeiro and the exposures were organized from the least to the most anxiogenic situation on this scenario. Result: The treatment produced significant improvement of depression symptoms. There was a trend towards improvement of anxiety measured by the ASI-R and improvement of panic symptoms measured by the DSQ. There was also a significant improvement of sense of presence (IPQ – general presence) through the exposure sessions.", "Conclusions: The current study demonstrated that VRET as an add -on to pharmacological therapy could benefit PD patients. Larger randomized controlled clinical trials are warranted to confirm the efficacy of VRET.", "Keywords: Panic Disorder, Agoraphobia, Virtual Reality Exposure Therapy, Cognitive Behavioural Therapy.", "1. Introduction", "Currently, panic disorder (PD) affects about 2% of the world population and it is a serious condition with uncertain factors, in some way, associated with stressful changes in the patient's life. (Vincelli and Riva, 2002) PD is a chronic and di sabling disorder that has negative effects on daily functioning and on quality of life. (Bandelow and Michaelis, 2015) Many psychological and pharmacological treatments for PD are available and considered effective. The first -line pharmacological treatment s for PD are venlafaxine and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), including paroxetine, sertraline, fluoxetine, citalopram and fluvoxamine. These drugs were demonstrated effective for PD and agoraphobia. (Mochcovitch and Nardi, 2010) Among psyc hological treatments, c ognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is probably the most effective approach for PD. CBT’s efficacy can be increased if exposure is included on the treatment. (Hofmann and Smits, 2008) The exposure used on the PD treatment can be intero ceptive, in vivo, to imagery or to virtual reality. Interoceptive exposure is used to reduce the fear of somatic symptoms by repeatedly engaging patients in exercises that cause physical sensations like those experienced during a panic attack. The fear sys tem, activated during the exposure, changes as result of inhibitory learning process reducing experienced fear. (Craske et al. 2014) The in vivo gradual exposure consists in list phobic situations mapping the difficulty of each one to organize the exposure from the least anxiety provoking to the most. In every exposure session the intensity is increased. Agoraphobic situations are included, such as being in a shopping mall, downtown, eating at a restaurant, taking buses, and other particular situations. The aim of exposure is to generate habituation. (Öst, LG, Thulin, U and Ramnerö, The virtual reality exposure treatment (VRET) has been developed to treat patients that are not able to confront the real objects, animals or situations. VRET is consid ered secure and can be used as a preparation to the in vivo exposure. (Shiban, Pauli, & Mühlberger, 2013) VR allows the clinician to adjust the intensity of the stimuli so that the patient can start at the easiest level and progress to the most difficult o ne. (Vincelli and Riva, 2002) It is important that the virtual reality environments allow the participants to act, interact and modify the atmosphere", "they are inserted. The definition of virtual reality assumes that the participant is not only an observer but can modify the context and can be affected by it. (de Carvalho, Freire, and Nardi, 2010).", "The concept of presence is crucial on VR exposure. It essentially means that the individual feels like a part of the virtual setting, instead of the real location in which one is physically. (de Carvalho, Freire, and Nardi, 2010) The more involved in tasks in VR the individual is, the better the presence is. (Coelho et al., 2006) The sense of presence on virtual reality takes account two constructs, the first of th em is immersion, which means the individuals are perceiving themselves involved and interacting with VR environment, the second one is involvement, considered a consequence of focusing attention on stimuli. The more motivated to execute the tasks, the bett er involvement an individual will have. (Witmer and Singer 1998; Krijn et al. 2007). The sense of presence is individual and varies from person to person. Some patients feel the sense of presence in a VR environment immediately, but others need two or thr ee sessions to increase the immersion. (Wiederhold and Wiederhold 2000) Other important definition is about motion sickness used to describe the feeling of discomfort and symptoms associated with VR exposure that few patients describe. Among the symptoms associated with virtual exposure, nausea, tiredness, headaches, sweating, disorientation, eyestrain , dizziness, difficulty focusing, vertigo, burping and stomach awareness can be noticed. (Kenedy et al. 1993) Several studies highlighted the use of VRE T in the treatment of anxiety disorders. (Parsons & Rizzo, 2008; Powers & Emmelkamp,2008). Specific phobias, fear of flying, acrophobia, social phobia, PTSD (Meyerbröker and Emmelkamp, 2010; de Carvalho, Freire, and Nardi, 2010), and PD (Pérez -Ara et al., 2010; Vincelli et al., 2003). However, the studies with PD are still scarce and use dissimilar protocols, with effectiveness varying according to the protocol a comparison treatment. (Opris et al., 2012) The aim of this study is to verify the efficacy of add -on VRET to pharmacotherapy in the treatment of PD patients.", "2. Methods", "Eight patients with panic disorder diagnosis participated in the study. Those are patients from the Institute of Psychiatry of the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro and are on pharmacolog ical treatment for panic disorder.

Patients who did not know how to read or write, or had Axis II pathology, were excluded.

Additionally, after all exposures, the Igroup Presence Questionnaire (IPQ) (Vasconcelos -Raposo et al.; 2016) for measuring the se nse of presence experienced in the virtual environment was applied.", "The virtual environment developed simulated the subway of Rio de Janeiro and the patients used an HTC Vive virtual reality system to access the environment.

We tested for correlations between caffeine intake, demographic and clinical features.", "Results : Patients consumed significantly more caffeine than controls (P < 0.001). Fourteen percent (N = 9) of the PD patients made harmful use of caffeine. Use of caffeine - containing medications was observed in 40% (N = 26) of the PD patients and 6% (N = 4) of controls. Consumption of energy drinks was observed in 11% (N = 7) of PD patient s and in none of the healthy subjects. Patients reported sleeping significantly less than controls (P < 0.001). In PD patients, caffeine consumption was not correlated to the presence of panic attacks or comorbidity with depression.

Subtypes of sensitive and non-sensitive PD patients coul d also explain why some of these patients are able to tolerate high doses of caffeine.", "Keywords: caffeine, adenosine receptors, panic disorder, panic attacks, sleep deprivation.", "1. Introduction", "Panic disorder (PD) is an anxiety disorder characterized by recu rrent panic attacks (PA), fear of causes and consequences of these attacks, and avoidance. [1] Patients with this disorder are sensitive to anxiogenic/panicogenic affects of many substances, including lactate, carbon dioxide, chole cystokinin, yohimbine and even antidepressants. [2-4] Several studies demonstrated that single doses of caffeine may induce anxiety and PA in these patients. [2, 5, 6] One would expect that PD patients would decrease or discontinue caffeine use due to its anxiogenic effects, [7] however, many PD patients continue consuming this substance, what could be explained by habit, culture or an attempt to offset sedative effects of medications. In those with major depressive disorder comorbidity, caffeine could be used as self -medicatio n, due to its activating effects. [7, Caffeine is one of the most consumed psychoactive substances in the world. Its effects include increased alertness and arousal, physical resistance, improvement of mood, tol erance to sleep deprivation and to pain, sociability and well -being. [7] It is consumed in foods and beve rages, such as chocolate, cocoa, soft drinks, coffee, tea, yerba mate and energy drinks. Caffeine may be included in in analgesic formulations [9] and in some food supplements that supposedly increase energetic expenditure. [10] Population - based surveys in the US indicate that 85 -95% of adults consume caffeine, and the mean intake is 193 mg/day, [11] while in Brazil, considering only caffeine consumed in coffee, the mean intake is 238 mg/day. [12] Daily caffeine consumption above 400 mg could be associated to general toxicity, cardiovascular eﬀects, behavioural changes and other medical problems. [13] Acute use", "of caffeine may cause tachycardia, hypertension, irritability, anxiety, insomnia, and other symptoms. [14] A single dose of caffeine (400 to 480 mg) may induce PA in 35% to 48% of PD patients but does not induce PA in healthy subjects. [5, 6] By reducing sleeping hours, caffeine could indirectly cause headache, irritability, fatigue and inability to concentrate. [9] Caffeine -induced sleep deprivation may also increase anxiety and PA. [15] In the study from Roy -Byrne et al. [15], one night's sleep deprivation induced PA in 40% of PD patients.", "Adenosine is an inhibitory neurotransmitter present in the central nervous system and adenosine receptors, particularly A 1 and A 2A receptors, are likely to be the major targets for caffeine. [7] Caffeine binds to these receptors and antagonizes the effects of adenosine. The activation of A 1 receptors by adenosine can cause inhibition of adenylyl cyclase and voltage -sensitive Ca++-channels such as the N - and the Q-channels, and activation of several types of K+-channels, phospholipase C and phospholipase D. Consequently, a host of different cellular effects can ensue. Adenosine A 1 receptors are present in almost all brain areas, with the highest levels in hippocam pus, cerebral and cerebellar cortex, and certain thalamic nuclei. Only moderate levels are found in caudate - putamen and nucleus accumbens. The presence of presynaptic adenosine A 1 receptors mediating inhibition of transmitter release has been demonstrated on virtually all types of neurons. Still, the mechanisms through which caffeine induces anxiety are not fully understood. It is known that adenosine, acting via A 1 receptors, can regulate the release of many different neurotransmitters, including glutamate . If the effect of adenosine is blocked, excitatory transmission would be enhanced, which could directly or indirectly influence GABAergic transmission. Studies also demonstrated that high concentrations of caffeine can decrease the binding of benzodiazepi nes. [7]", "Apparently, susceptibility to caffeine -related adverse effects may be affected by the capacity t o metabolize the substance, which is lower in individuals carrying the CYP1A2 polymorphism in the gene that codifies the cytochrome P450 oxidase. [16] The adenosine A 2A receptor gene (ADORA2A) variation may also in crease susceptibility to caffeine’s negative effects, such as anxiety and PA. [17, 18] In patients with this polymorphism, caffeine binds with high affinity to the adenosine A 2A brain receptor, [17] inducing PA after the consumption of caffeine doses as low as 150 mg. [18] In addition, Hohoff et al. [19] found that the variant rs5751876 of the ADORA2A gene is in fact a risk factor for PD, particularly PD with agoraphobia. High family history of PD, w hich implies high genetic loading, was consistently observed in PD respiratory subtype patients. [20] Nardi et al. [21] found that these patients had more caffeine -induced panic attacks (odds ratio = 8.9; 95% confidence interval = 3.3 - 24.0) compared to non - respirato ry subtype PD patients.", "Currently, data on caffeine consumption and caffeine abuse in PD patients is still lacking. The primary objective of this study was to assess the consumption of caffeine in a clinical sample of PD patients and compare it with the ca ffeine consumption in healthy subjects. The secondary objective was to ascertain if caffeine consumption is associated with sociodemographic or clinical features.", "2. Materials and methods", "This observational case -control study was conducted from July 2015 to July 2016 at the outpatient clinic of the Laboratory of Panic and Respiration at the Institute of Psychiatry of Federal University of Rio de Janeiro. Adults were eligible if they had at least two panic attacks in the month preceding inclusion. Healthy cont rols, matched for age and sex, were selected among staff and students. Patients were excluded if they had", "bipolar disorder, schizophrenia or severe personality disorder, while controls were excluded if they used any sedative, antidepressant or antipsychoti c medication within the week preceding the interview. Both patients and controls were excluded if they used any illicit drug within the week preceding the interview.", "A detailed questionnaire on caffeine consumption and sleeping habits within the week befor e the interview was used in the assessment. The caffeine content of food and beverages was quantified according to the caffeine chart from Mayo Clinic. [22] The caffeine content of medications was obtained in the medications’ labels. Ca ffeine contents in analgesic formulations varied from 30 to 50 mg per dose. In thermogenic supplements and other food supplements the caffeine contents varied from 100 to 400 mg per dose. According to the study from Nawrot et al. [13] the consumption of caffeine up to 400 mg/day does not present significant health risks, but above this level it could be associated to general toxicity, cardiovascular eﬀects, changes in adult behaviour, increased incidence of cancer, eﬀects on calcium ba lance or male fertility. In the current study the authors considered caffeine use above 400 mg/day as “harmful caffeine use”. The study was approved by the institutional ethics committee. All subjects signed an informed consent form before inclusion in the study.", "Continuous variables were compared between groups with Student's t Test, and categorical variables, with the Chi -Square Test. Spearman’s and point biserial correlations were used to check for correlations between variables. The level of statistica l significance was set at 5%. IBM SPSS Statistics version 20 was used for data analysis.", "3. Results The baseline characteristics of the 65 patients and 66 controls included in the study are shown in Table 1. Among PD patients, 68% had comorbidity with depres sion. Fifteen", "patients (23%) were not using antidepressants, benzodiazepines or other psychotropic medications. Of the 43 (65%) patients using antidepressants, 28 (42%) were being treated with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, 7 (11%) with serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors, 8 (12%) with tricyclics, and 2 (3%) with other antidepressants. Forty - three patients (65%) were on benzodiazepines on a regular basis, 35 (53%) were using clonazepam, while 8 (12%) were using other benzodiazepines. A total of 35 (53%) patients were using both antidepressants and benzodiazepines. There were also patients on quetiapine, zolpidem and topiramate, one patient using each of these drugs. None of the patients or controls were using melatonin or other sedative s.", "Daily consumption of coffee was reported by 41 patients (63%) and 46 controls (70%). Patients consumed significantly more caffeine than controls. PD patients reported using more caffeine -containing medications and energy drinks than controls. Nine patie nts (14%) and none of the controls were taking six or more pills of caffeine - containing medications per day, seven days a week. One patient (2%) was using thermogenic supplement pills (with high caffeine dose) before exercising, as an attempt to increase e nergy expenditure. There were nine (14%) PD patients and no controls with harmful caffeine use pattern. (Table 1) (Figure 1) Forty -seven percent of the PD patients had at least one PA in the week preceding the study. The caffeine consumption was 272 (SD = 131) mg/day for PD patients who had recent PA and 247 (SD = 121) mg/day for patients who did not have recent PA, there were no statistically significant differences between the two groups (Point biserial correlation 0.134, P = 0.287). (Figure 2) Comorbidit y with depression, benzodiazepine use or use of sedative medications (amitriptyline, imipramine, nortriptyline, trazodone, quetiapine or zolpidem) were not correlated to caffeine intake in PD patients.", "Patients reported sleeping significantly fewer hours p er night than controls and there was a strong negative correlation between the caffeine consumption and hours of sleep (Spearman’s rho: -0.478; P< 0.001) in the whole sample analysis. In the analysis of the PD group, caffeine intake was not correlated to h ours of sleep. There were reports from some patients that they tried at least once to quit caffeine abruptly because of sleep deprivation, headache or both, but their attempts resulted in severe headache that remitted with caffeine -containing analgesics, o r caffeine -containing food or beverages.", "4. Discussion", "In the current study we demonstrated that PD patients consume significantly more caffeine than healthy subjects. Interestingly, higher caffeine intake was not associated to panic attacks. This evidence is not in accordance with studies of single -dose administration of caffeine, [5, 6] which demonstrated provocation of PA in a significant portion of PD patients. The difference found between acute and chronic use cou ld be attributed to the establishment of tolerance to caffeine. One hypothesis would be that chronic caffeine users develop tolerance to this substance, and for this reason would not have PA even with high caffeine doses. Those who do not use caffeine regu larly would remain sensitive to this substance. Another hypothesis, in agreement with the one from Nawrot et at., [13] would be that PD patients are able to adjust their caffeine intake according to their individua l sensitivity to this substance. One subgroup of patients would be sensitive to caffeine, and for this reason consume little or no caffeine. The other subgroup would not be sensitive to caffeine’s panicogenic effects, and would be able to consume large amo unts of this substance. Genetic factors [18] or respiratory subtype [20] could be mediators to caffeine sensitivity in PD.", "It is still not clear why PD patients would consume more caffeine than control subjects. Depression symptoms, which could include low energy, low motivation and hypersomnia, could prompt PD patients to use stimulating substances, including caffeine. [23] However, we did not find association between major depressive disorder diagnosis and caffeine consumption. We also investigated the hypothesis that PD patients used caffeine as an attempt to counteract the sedative effects of benzodiazepines and other medi cations, and found that caffeine consumption was not correlated to these medications.", "As demonstrated in the current study, PD patients consume considerable amounts of caffeinated products, and some of them consumed more than 400 mg per day, which is the m aximum recommended dose. Making recommendations and providing information about negative effects of caffeine is important for our patients to make decisions. Regular caffeine use superior to 500 -600 mg/day could result in \"caffeinism\", which is a syndrome characterized by several adverse reactions including restlessness, anxiety, irritability, agitation, muscle tremor, insomnia, headache, diuresis, sensory disturbances, cardiovascular and gastrointestinal symptoms. [13] Even lower doses could produce health problems such as decreased fertility in males and obstetric complications during pregnancy. [13] An important limitation of this study is that data on caffeine consumption , sleeping habits and panic attacks were collected by self -reported questionnaire, which are subject to recall bias. A more precise way to assess the caffeine consumption would be the measurement of its serum level, but that was not done in the current stu dy. The researchers did not use specific clinical scales to assess depression symptoms or PD symptoms. This study could be underpowered to identify correlations with low effect sizes in the PD group analysis. Since this is a cross -sectional study, we were able to check", "for correlations, but it was not possible to identify which were the causes and which were the effects.", "5. Conclusions", "Caffeine consumption in PD patients was high, compared to healthy controls. However, high caffeine intake was not correlated t o panic attacks, depression, sedative medication use or sleeping hours. Future research should elucidate if regular caffeine use decreases the sensitivity to caffeine’s panicogenic effects or if there are subgroups of PD patients with low and high sensitiv ity to caffeine. In a clinical setting it is important to inform patients about the problems that could arise with regular consumption of large doses of caffeine, even if caffeine does not interfere with anxiety and panic symptoms.", "6.

Introduction", "Anxiety disorders constitute the largest group of mental disorders and are a leading cause of impairment, implicating in high costs for the health systems and for the society. The most common features are ex -cessive and persistent fear and related behavioral disturbances, anxiety or avoidance of perceived threats, and panic attacks. Even in developed countries, most of the anxiety disorders persist unexplored and un -treated. The disabilities associated are huge from limitations in daily functioning to being unable to leave home. ( Craske et Cognitive behavioral therapy (CB T) is the “gold standard ” psy-chotherapy for anxiety disorders ( Hofmann and Smits, 2008 ). Its ob -jective is reducing symptoms by increasing adaptive emotion regula -tion. ( O'Toole et al., 2015 ) The eﬃcacy of psychotherapy, CBT and other psychological approaches has been demonstrated in several clinical trials, ( Bandelow et al., 2017 ) however, about 50.5% of the anxiety disorder patients do not respond to CBT in post - treatment", "assessments ( Loeri nc et al., 2015 ). A better understanding on the neu - rophysiology of anxiety disorders could explain why most of the pa -tients have great symptom improvement while some of them do not improve at all. (Nitschke et al., 2009 ; Whalen et al., 2008 ) Several stu dies have applied functional neuroimaging to map neural changes promoted by psychotherapy. ( Barsaglini et al., 2014 ; Messina et al., 2013 ). Psychotherapy mechanisms of action promote the e ﬀec-tiveness of control process of executive functions located in prefrontal areas, indicating successful activation of emotional regulation proce -dures of exposures to emotionally stimuli with anxiogenic or negative features.

The activated areas by semantic tasks are temporoparietal junction (TPJ), anterior temporal lobe (aTL), ventromedia l prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC).

Open trials", "Doehrmann et al. (2013) analyzed brain activation in 39 patients with SAD as biomarker to predict response to CBT. Clinical assessment with the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS; Liebowitz, 1987 ) took place before and after treatment. fMRI data were collected to assess brain responses to angry vs neutral faces or emotional vs neutral scenes before 12 weeks of group based CBT. Patients ' LSAS scores reduced signi ficantly after CBT (p < 0.001) and greater treatment response was associated with greater pretreatment activation in right cuneus, su -perior occipital gyrus and posterior aspects of middle temporal gyrus. Pretreatment brain respo nses for angry vs neutral faces in occipito -temporal areas were positively associated with good CBT outcomes. Klumpp et al. (2014) investigated if pretreatment activity in ante -rior cingulate cortex (ACC) and dlPFC could predict response to CBT on 21 subjects with SAD. Symptom severity was assessed with LSAS and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI; Beck et al., 1996a ), CGI -I was used to determine if patients responded to intervention. Patients participated in resting -state fMRI before a 12 -week CBT protocol . The LSAS scores decreased from an average of 71.6 to 51.5 after the therapy, (p < 0.001) and 70% of the patients were considered responders. The clinical improvement after CBT was predicted by greater pretreatment amygdala connectivity with prefrontal re gions implicated in controlling emotion. fMRI analyses demonstrated that greater symptom reduction was foretold by increased pre -CBT right amygdala -pregenual ACC (pgACC) and left amygdala -pgACC -mPFC (medial pre -frontal cortex) coupling, a circuit involved in emotion processing and regulation. The same group ( Klumpp et al., 2014a ) examined potential brain", "predictors of response to CBT in attentional control in emotion pro -cessing. During fMRI scanning, 21 SAD patients viewed images com -prising a trio of geometric shapes presented alongside a trio of faces condition (angry, fearful and happy) within the same field of view. Attentional control was measured with the instruction to “match shapes ”, directing attention away from emotional faces, which was contr asted with “match faces ”, by which attention was directed to faces. After 12 weeks of CBT, the LSAS scores decreased from an average of 72.5 to 50.4, (p < 0.001) while the BDI scores decreased from 12.3 to 6.2 (p < 0.002), 70% of patients were considered r esponders, based on CGI - I scores. Whole -brain analyses indicated that the improvement was predicted by high pretreatment activity in emotional face distractors in the dACC, dorsal medial pre -frontal cortex (dmPFC). CBT e ﬀectiveness was predicted by low activity in the amygdala or increased activity in the medial orbitofrontal gyrus (mOFG) during emotional procedure.", "Klumpp et al., 2016 studied the neural predictors of CBT response based in emotional con flict resolution i n 32 patients with SAD. Before 12 weeks of CBT, during fMRI, patients performed a task involving a target letter in a string of identical targets or a target letter in a mixed letter string overlapped on fearful, angry and neutral face distractors. LSAS, t he self -reported Spielberger State - Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI; Spielberger et al., 1983 ) and BDI were used to evaluate anxiety and depression, response was de fined according to the CGI -I scores.

Prior to 12 weeks of CBT, the patients comple ted an emotional regulation task during fMRI. Patients were instructed to: use a cognitive -linguistic strategy to reduce negative a ﬀect evoked by image ( “reappraise ”); at-tend to, be aware of when looking at an aversive image ( “look nega -tive”); or view na tural images ( “look natural ”), this task comprised 64 unpleasant and 32 neutral images. Symptom severity was measured by LSAS, depression was evaluated with BDI and Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM -D; Hamilton, 1960 ) and the Emotional Regulation Quest ionnaire (ERQ: Gross and John, 2003 ) was used to evaluate ha -bitual use of reappraisal and expressive suppression. After CBT, LSAS scores decreased from 77.7 to 47.3, p < 0.001 and HAMD levels de - clined from 8.3 to 3.2, (p < 0.001) while BDI score at basel ine was 20.8 and after treatment it was 4.9 (p < 0.001). ERQ revealed an in -crease in the use of reappraisal (from 23 to 30, p < 0.001) and a de -crease in use of expressive suppression (from 17.9 to 15.2, p < 0.007), 32% were considered responders (at leas t 50% reduction in LSAS symptoms) and 68% were considered non - responders. Whole -brain analysis for reappraise vs. look revealed that greater reduction in symptom severity was predicted by low baseline activity in the dlPFC. These findings indicate that dlP FC is a region strongly implicated in emotion regulation, and for this reason, CBT would be more e ﬀective in SAD patients with low pretreatment dlPFC recruitment.", "The same group ( Klumpp et al., 2017a ) examined the hypothesis that clinically -meaningful ch ange immediately after CBT would be predicted by baseline ACC activity during emotion faces interference task in SAD patients. Before 12 weeks of CBT treatment, 38 patients completed implicit and explicit emotion regulation tasks during fMRI. Implicit emot ional regulation implicated attentional control over ne -gative distractors while explicit regulation involved cognitive re -appraisal to negative images. The brain activity analyses were restricted to rostral ACC (rACC), dACC and amygdala masks. Symptom severity was measured with LSAS and HAM -D, self -reported attentional control with Attentional Control Scale (ACS; Derryberry and Reed, 2002 ), subjective emotion regulation with ERQ and the global improvement were measured with CGI -S and CGI -I. After CBT, all patients showed improvement on social anxiety symptoms, with LSAS scores reduced from 77.8 to 49.2; HAM -D reduced from 8.0 to 3.5; ACS increased from 46.5 to 52.0; ERQ increased for reappraisal from 23.4 to 29.6 and de -creased for suppression from 17.3 to 15.4. More rACC activity in im -plicit regulation and less rACC activity during explicit regulations dis -tinguished responders (34%) from non - responders. Responders also had greater amygdala activity in implicit regulation task, compared to non -responders. With regard of emotional regulation, which CBT aims to improve, rACC activity predicted responder status but amygdala was recognized as a CBT neuromarker restricting to implicit emotional regulation.", "Yuan et al.

Patients presented decreased connectivity of left amygdala with the right putamen, left dorsal medial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) and the right dACC.

Across SAD studies, findings regarding amygdala and ACC consistently predicted response to CBT. The studies with PDAG and GAD, ( Lueken et al., 2013 ; Reinecke et al., 2014 ; Liebscher et al., 2016 ; Kircher et al., 2013 ; Straub e et al., 2014 ; Ball et al., 2014 ; Fonzo et al., 2014 ) highlighted the neuroimaging findings in the following areas as predictors of response of CBT: ACC, hippo -campus, insula, dlPFC, amygdala, left iFG. The most consistent findings regarding response to treatment were observed in amygdala, insula, hippocampus and ACC.", "Although uncus is a region associated with accuracy of prediction, and uncus activation has been correlated with worry and overall anxiety disorders ( Ball et al., 2014 ), in none of the GAD st udies this area was observed as predictor of response however it was observed in SAD studies.", "CBT produced several brain function changes in SAD patients ( Mansson et al., 2013 ; Klumpp et al., 2013 ; Klumpp et al., 2014 ; Klumpp et al., 2014a ; Klumpp et al. , 2016 ; Klumpp et al., 2017a ; Yuan et al., 2016 ; Yuan et al., 2017 ; Yuan et al., 2018 ; Furmark et al., 2002 ; Young et al., 2017 ; Goldin et al., 2014 ; Mansson et al., 2016 ), including modi fications in: left and right amygdala, caudate, cerebellum, dlPFC, pu tamen, mOFG, ACC, supramarginal gyrus, dmPFC, right dlPFC, pre -cuneus, hippocampus, insula, right sFG, IPL, MOG and left pSTG. In the PDAG and GAD studies ( Lueken et al., 2013 ; Liebscher et al., 2016 ; Kircher et al., 2013 ; Straube et al., 2014 ; Ball et al. , 2014 ; Fonzo et al., 2014 ), CBT produced changes in: ACC, hippocampus, pre and post central gyri, amygdala, left middle temporal gyrus, fusiform gyrus, in -ferior occipital gyrus, inferior frontal gyrus, left uncus, left transversal temporal gyrus and righ t substantia nigra.", "Although the e ﬀectiveness of psychotherapy has been proved and described in several studies ( Bandelow et al., 2017 ) the underlying mechanism of psychotherapy are still not well clari fied and to de -termine that a considerable numbers of studies applied fMRI to identify t he brain circuits that change during psychotherapy. ( Messina et al., 2016 ; Lueken et al., 2016 ) CBT teaches emotion regulation strategies promoting control of executive functions, which are situated in pre -frontal areas. The areas commonly associated to em otional regulation are dlPFC and dACC ( Corbetta et al., 2008 ; Messina et al., 2016 ), and the activation of these areas was observed in several studies of the current review ( Klumpp et al., 2014 ; Klumpp et al., 2014a ; Klumpp et al., 2016 ; Klumpp et al., 201 7; Klumpp et al., 2017a ; Yuan et al., 2016 ; Yuan et al., 2017 ; Yuan et al., 2018 ; Mansson et al., 2013 ). Our findings are compatible with those of Klumpp et al., 2013 , that CBT -related brain changes involves reduction in activity in insula, PFC and extrast riate regions. Additionally, our review gives support to findings from previous studies ( Mochcovitch et al., 2014 ) indicating that there is a de ficit in the functional connectivity between PFC, ACC and the amygdala in anxiety disorders.", "An important limit ation of this review is the variety of cognitive and emotional tasks utilized to access imaging data and the di ﬀerent methods utilized in the reviewed studies. This heterogeneity makes generalizations almost impossible when we analyze the results alto -gether.", "Concluding, this systematic review aimed to map neuroimaging findings that could predict response to psychotherapy in adults with anxiety disorders. According to our findings, amygdala, insula, hippo -campus and ACC are relevant predictors of treatment response in an -xiety disorders. In addition, abnormalities in the areas linked with emotional regulation (dlPFC and dACC), hippocampus, amygdala, left middle temporal gyrus, fusiform gyrus, inferior occipital gyrus, inferior frontal gyrus, left transversa l temporal gyrus and uncus also predict", "V.A. Santos et al.", "successful outcomes of CBT in anxiety disorders. Emotional regulation seems to be a challenge for anxiety disorder patients and, for this reason, it should be a target for psychotherapies. Neuroimaging con -tributes to a better understanding of the brain function, and may aid therapists in the quest for tailored treatments.", "References", "Ball, T.M., Stein, M.B., Ramsawh, H.J., Campbell -Sills, L., Paulus, M.P., 2014.

Introduction", "Panic disorder (PD) affects about 2% worldwide p opulation, what corresponds to more than 4 million people with PD in Brazil. PD is a chronic and disabling disorder that has negative effects on functioning and quality of life. (Bandelow and Michaelis, 2015) It is characterized by recurrent unexpected pan ic attacks, anxiety related to the occurrence of panic attacks and worries about the causes or consequences of panic attacks. (APA, 2013) Diagnostic manuals such as DSM and ICD guide clinicians while diagnosing patients with mental health problems. Besides the clinical interviews, clinical scales can assist the clinician to reach precise diagnoses and have a better understanding of the clinical status of each patient. Examples of those include the Panic and Agoraphobia Scale (Bandelow), the Panic Disorder Severity Scale (PDSS) (Shear et al., 1997) and the Diagnostic Symptom Questionnaire (DSQ) (Sanderson et al., 1989).", "The DSMs and other diagnostic manuals have been criticized by not taking into account the problems related to subclinical mental disorders. Appraisal of subclinical and subsyndromic symptoms of PD has important implications on the course of disease and although these symptoms, generally, never progress to the full severity of disease, they contribute and aggravate the PD evolution and have to be considered. The PD diagnosis in the DSMs is categorical and fails to capture the continuum of clinical presentations present in patients. The concept of a panic -agoraphobic spectrum is an alternative approach that encompasses the spectrum of symptoms, t raits and behaviors of panic, agoraphobia and other related disorders such as hypochondria and separation anxiety disorder. In addition, it includes symptoms not listed in DSM5 criteria that are frequently present in patients with PD (Cassano et al., 1997, Pini et al., 1998; Frank et al., Considering the lack of adequate instruments to assess the panic - agoraphobic spectrum, Cassano et al. developed the Structured Clinical Interview for the Panic -Agoraphobic Spectrum (SCI -PAS) (Mauri et al., 1997), and subsequently, the Panic -Agoraphobic Spectrum Self -Report scale (PAS -SR) (Cassano et al., 1997; Shear et al., 2002 ). The PAS -SR is an instrument to assess the panic -agoraphobic spectrum, identifying psychopathological symptoms, anticipatory anxiety and a goraphobia in 114 questions. The instrument considers DSM -IV (APA, 2000) criteria of diagnostic of PD and agoraphobia.", "Although the PAS -SR has been already validated in several countries such as Italy, Spain, United States (Cassano et al., 1999; Berrocal et al., 2006; Shear et al, 2001 ), there is no validated version of PAS -SR in Brazilian Portuguese . In addition, there are no other instruments to assess the panic -agoraphobic spectrum in the Brazilian population.", "Therefore, the authors aim to cre ate a version of PAS -SR in Brazilian Portuguese with sound psychometric properties.", "2. Methods", "2.1. The Panic -Agoraphobic Spectrum Self -Report", "The scores of PAS -SR range from zero to 114. A threshold of 35 on the score was determined using ROC analysis to identi fy subjects with significant levels of panic -agoraphobic spectrum. The factor analysis showed existence of ten domains that explained 66.38% of the variance of the questionnaire: panic symptoms, agoraphobia, claustrophobia, separation anxiety, fear of losi ng control, drug sensitivity and phobia, medical reassurance, rescue object, loss sensitivity, reassurance from family members. These domains were inspired on Klein’s approach (Klein, 1993) on discussion groups and clinical experience. Each item of PAS -SR scale is coded as present or absent thought subject’s lifetime, over last week or past month. The correspondents items of the factors sensitivity (11, 12, 13, 15) and Family reassurance (89, 90 , 91).(Rucci et al.; The PAS -SR linguistic equivalence was assessed using a ‘‘forward - backward’’ translation procedure. A psychiatry and a psychologist, two bilingual experts who were not familiar with the original instrument but aware of research purpose, made the translation of the original version of the questionnaire from English to Portuguese. The resulting paper was then translated back into the original version by a psychologist and a nurse both fluent in English and Portuguese. Both the trans lated result as the back translated paper were evaluated of comprehensibility of the items in a consensus reunion performed by the first author of the paper and two more experts in anxiety disorders in order to make semantics adjustments for the Portuguese language and evaluate verbal understanding of questionnaire resulting of final version of PAS -SR. At the consensus reunion, the item 8 (Did you have repeated nightmares about being separated from your family (for example, nightmares about fires, murder, o r other catastrophes?) was completed with shooting situation because in Brazil it is a catastrophe that most people are afraid of. Other modified item was the 10Th (Did you experience a lot of distress when separated from loved ones in bad weather (for exa mple, when there were thunderstorms, snowstorms, or when it was very windy?). In Brazil we do not have snowstorms, so we considered thunderstorms, frosts, heavy rains or strong winds. Other items were only semantic organized to facilitate the understanding of patients. After that, a final version of PAS -SR in Brazilian Portuguese was created to be validated. The validation process included a clinical group of 41 patients with PD on treatment and recruited at Panic and Respiration Laboratory of Psychiatry Institute of Federal University of Rio de Janeiro and 41 healthy controls who were between 22 and 68 years of age. The inclusion criteria to patient group were to have PD diagnose and being on PD treatment and for healthy controls have no psychiatry diagnos e. The exclusion criteria included volunteers who did not know how to read or write or had Axis II pathology.", "Participants signed informed consent and individually, provided demographic information, as age and gender, and completed the Brazilian Portugues e version of PAS -SR (Cassano et al.; 1997), the Diagnostic Symptom Questionnaire (DSQ) (Sanderson et al.; 1989), the Mobility Inventory (MI) (Chambless et al.; 1985), the Anxiety Sensitivity Index (ASI) (Taylor and Cox, 1998), the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) (Beck et al., 1961), the Beck Anxiety inventory (BAI) (Beck, Epstein, Brown, & Steer, 1988) and the short version of the World Health Organization Quality of Life scale (WHOQOL -BREF) (Whoqol Group, 1995). A mental health professional administered th e Panic Disorder Severity Scale (PDSS) and the Clinical Global Impression (severity) scale (CGI).", "2.2. Other instruments", "The (DSQ) (Sanderson et al.; 1989) is a list of 13 PA symptoms adapted from DSM -IV in which the presence and level of discomfort of each p anic symptom experienced after the inhalations is rated on a 0 - (none) to 4 -point (very severe) scale, and the total score ranges from 0 to 52.", "The MI (Chambless et al.; 1985) is a 27 -item inventory for the measurement of self-reported agoraphobic avoidanc e behavior and frequency of panic attacks. 26 situations are rated for avoidance both when patients are accompanied and when they are alone. These two conditions were found to be only moderately correlated and are thus analyzed separately, as is the item o n frequency of panic attacks. The WHOQOL -BREF questionnaire (Whoqol Group, 1995) consists of 26 questions of the quality of life profile in four domains: physical (pain, discomfort, energy, fatigue, sleep, rest, activities of daily life, dependence on med ication or treatments, mobility, ability to work); psychological (positive feelings, thought, learning, memory, concentration, self -esteem, body image, appearance, negative feelings, spirituality, religion, personal beliefs); social relations (personal relations, social support, sexual activity); and functioning in the environmental (physical security, protection, home environment, financial resources, care with health and quality, opportunities for acquiring new information and skills, participation in rec reation and leisure opportunities). The score can reach up to 20 points in each domain and the higher the score, the better the quality of life. The ASI (Taylor and Cox; 1998) has four lower -order factors: fear of respiratory and cardiovascular symptoms; fear of cognitive dyscontrol; fear of publicly observable anxiety reactions, and fear of gastrointestinal symptoms factor. The scale has 36 items ranging from \"very little\" to \"Extremely\", where 0 is very Little; 1, A little; 2, Moderately; 3 lot and 4 ext remely. The sum of the scores ranges from 0 to 144 and the higher the score, the greater the sensitivity to anxiety. The BDI (Beck et al., 1961) is a 21 -item, self -report rating inventory measuring the presence and severity of major depression symptoms in two weeks ago. The scale consists in twenty -one items ranked 0 –3 for severity. The questionnaire is self-administered. The minimum score is 0 and maximum score is 63 and results are minimal depression (0 –9), mild depression (10 –18), moderate depression (19–29) and severe depression (30 –63).", "The BAI (Beck, Epstein, Brown, & Steer, 1988) consists of 21 items with a Likert scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 3 (severely) developed to access severity of anxiety symptoms. Ratings are from the past week and th e scores ranging from 0 to 63. The BAI scores are minimal anxiety (0 to 7), mild anxiety (8 to 15), moderate anxiety (16 to 25), and severe anxiety (30 to 63).", "The PDSS (Shear et al.; 1997) is a clinician -administered measure of PD severity. It consists i n 7-item scale assesses the frequency of panic attacks, distress during panic attacks, anticipatory anxiety, agoraphobic fear and avoidance, body - sensation fear and avoidance, and impairment in work and social functioning on 5-point scales (0 –4).", "The CGI ( Guy, 1976) evaluates the severity of psychopathology from 1 to 7 and the improvement from the beginning of treatment on the same seven -point scale. After a clinical evaluation, a mental health professional can complete CGI in less than one minute. In the c urrent study only the severity part of the CGI was employed.", "Descriptive statistics were used to access demographic characteristics and the data are presented as a number and percentage or a mean and standard deviation. Internal consistency was measured wi th Cronbach's alpha coefficient. This coefficient ranges from 0 to 1; alpha values between 0.70 and 0.90 are considered acceptable . To verify convergent validity and compare PAS with other scales this study used Spearman’s rho correlation coefficient analy sis and the result showed significant correlations. (Table 4)", "3. Results", "All of 84 participants completed the surveys and were included in the analyses. The demographic and clinical characteristics of the sample are shown in Table 1.", "Internal consistency was measured using Cronbach's alpha coefficient. The total value of internal consistency is considerable good (.789) but the internal consistency of factors was below expected. (Table 2) As expected, the PAS -SR scores for PD patients were higher than the ones for healthy controls. Mean total score was significantly higher for PD patients (12.34 SD 3.92) than in controls (4.60 SD 4.00). Except for \"loss sensitivity\" factor, the score differences between groups were significant. These results are described in Table 3, as well as, the mean score of PAS domains in each group.", "Additionally, as expected, our study observed a significative correlation (p<0.001) of moderated intensity (0.445) between PAS -SR agoraphobia and PDSS agoraphobia; PAS -SR total and DSQ to tal showed a significant correlation (p<0.001) with moderated intensity (0.352), as well as PAS -SR total and PDSS total showed strong and statistically significant correlation (0.583).", "4. Discussion", "Our results provide evidence of reliability and validity o f Brazilian version of PAS - SR. Each spectrum domain correlates with total score and the administration of the instrument on PD patients showed significant higher scores than the healthy controls scores. These evidences provide support for the validity of p anic spectrum and PAS on Brazilian population.", "The PAS -SR demonstrated a strong and statistically significant correlation among others PD scales as PDSS total (.583**), PDSS Panic (.542**), PDSS AGO (.507**), DSQ total (.352*) and DSQ Resp (.401**) see tab le 4, providing evidence of reliability and validity of PAS -SR.", "The Brazilian version of the PAS -SR showed good internal consistency (.789) but weak internal consistency in the factors. Our research confirms the coherence of spectrum symptoms of PD and th at this view gives support and important clinical information both for patients and for the psychiatry or psychologist, enhancing the adherence and treatment outcomes. Shear el al, 2001 extend these psychoeducational effect of a constellation of spectrum s ymptoms for PD, highlighting as a predictor of outcome in major depression and bipolar disorder. The same authors support that the panic -agoraphobic spectrum assessment provides a comprehensive estimation of panic symptoms, agoraphobia symptoms, other rela ted symptoms and behavioral traits. A limitation of our study was the fact that the clinical sample included PD patients with residual symptoms only; perhaps it could explain the weak internal consistency in PAS -SR factors. The enlargement of the sample , with the inclusion of PD patients with untreated and symptomatic characteristics will probably correct this result.", "5. Conclusion", "According to Cassano et al. (1999), the spectrum approach has advantages as improve treatment selection and strategies, monit oring the course of illness, improve subtyping of patients for clinical, biological, genetic research and enhance clinician -patient relationship.", "This study aimed to assess the translation and back -translation of the PAS -SR; determine the valid of constru ct and convergence; and report its reliability by internal consistency and retest methods. The total value of internal consistency is considerable good (.789) and PAS -SR demonstrated validity comparing with other scales, Spearman’s rho correlation coeffici ent analysis and the result showed a significant correlation.", "The PAS -SR shows good internal consistency in Brazilian population.

Conclusão", "No estudo 1 demonstramos que a TERV é um tratamento seguro e promissor para o TP . Apesar da amostra clínica muito pequena, o s resultados mostraram uma melhora significat iva dos s intomas de depressão no BDI (P = 0.033). Houve uma tendência para a melhora da ansiedade medida pela ESA -R e dos sintomas de pân ico medido pelo DSQ (P = 0,081). Houve também uma melhor a significativa do senso de presença (IPQ – presença ger al) através das exposições em realidade virtual (P = 0,044) . Apesar da ausência de diferenças estatisticamente significativas nas médias , a dispersão dos escores da PDSS, BAI e IM -desacompanhado eram menores após o tratamento, em comparação com antes do tratamento, sugeri ndo que os pacientes com sintomas mais graves de ansiedade, pânico e agorafobia se beneficiaram mais da TERV. Ao final do tratamento, foram encontradas diferenças nas medidas importantes de pânico. Quantitativamente os resultados não foram muito expressivo s, mas o relato subjetivo da maioria dos pacientes, que relatou melhora dos sintomas, foi muito marcante. Uma limitação do estudo é o pequeno tamanho da amostra que não é adequado para avaliar a e ficácia d a TERV . A realidade virtual é uma ferramenta promis sora que tem muito a ser explorado, mas já apresenta utilidade no tratamento de transtornos mentais. A exposição utilizando a realidade virtual é uma opção para ser usada no tratamento de transtornos específicos , mas ambientes virtuais específicos precisam ser desenvolvidos para esta finalidade e mais pesquisa clínica ainda precisa ser realizada a fim de consolidá -la como ferramenta para o tratamento dos transtornos mentais .", "Alguns estudos ressaltam a associação entre o consumo de cafeína e transtornos de ansiedade . (Kendler et al., 2006; Richards, 2015) Nosso estudo mostrou consumo maior de cafeína em pacientes com transtorno de pânico comparado aos controles saudáveis , no entanto, não houve diferença no consumo de cafeína entre pacientes com ou sem ataque s de pânico recentes . O número de horas de sono foi significativamente menor nos pacientes com TP, o que pode ser resultante do transtorno de ansiedade ou do uso abusivo da cafeína. Uma explicação para o elevado consumo de cafeína nessa população é o fato de terem construído o hábito de consumir cafeína desenvolvendo tolerância a essa substância antes mesmo de receberem o diagnóstico de transtorno de ansiedade. E mesmo depois do diagnóstico e dos efeitos prejudiciais , os pacientes continuam consumindo quant idade elevada de cafeína. O cortisol desempenha importante papel na fisiopatologia da ansiedade e da depressão. O consumo elevado de cafeína pode aumentar os níveis de cortisol contribuindo dessa forma, para a fisiopatologia do transtorno do pânico. (Lovallo et al., 2006) A psicoeducação sobre os prejuízos do elevado consumo de cafeína em pacientes ansiosos é importante para o tratamento e para melhora de qualidade de vida dessa população. Um programa de redução de consumo de cafeína deve ser implementado n o tratamento desses pacientes. A relação entre consumo de cafeína e ansiedade deve ser considerada em um tratamento, assim como os efeitos produzidos pelo consumo elevado de cafeína em pacientes com transtorno de ansiedade. A privação do sono deve ser inve stigada em relação ao consumo de cafeína pelo paciente , e este deve ser psicoeducado em relação a um consumo seguro e sem prejuízos.", "Em nosso estudo de revisão de neuroimagem com o objetivo de encontrar preditores de resposta do tratamento psicoterápico e m pacientes com transtorno de ansiedade reunimos 24 artigos sendo 17 de estudos com transtorno de ansiedade social, cinco com artigos com TP, um estudo com TAG e um artigo com TP e TAG. A região mais estudada e associada a transtornos de ansiedade tem sido a am ígdala por ser responsável pela aquisição, experiência e expressão do medo. (Ball et al., 2014) Nossa revisão ressaltou regiões como a amigdala, ínsula, hipocampo e córtex anterior cingulado como relevantes preditores de eficácia da TCC em pacientes c om transtornos de ansiedade. Além disso, alterações nas áreas ligadas à regulação emocional (dlPFC e dACC), hipocampo, amígdala, giro temporal médio, giro frontal inferior, giro fusiforme, giro occipital inferior esquerd o, uncus e giro temporal transversal também são preditores de eficácia do tratamento com TCC em transtornos de ansiedade. A regulação emocional é um desafio para os pacientes com transtorno de ansiedade , por esse motivo, deve ser um alvo para os tratamentos psicoter ápicos. O estudo de n euroi magem contribui para uma melhor compreensão da função cerebral e pode auxiliar os psico terapeutas a buscar tratamentos cada vez mais personalizados levando em consideração as áreas cerebrais relacionadas aos transtornos de ansiedade.", "Nosso estudo de valida ção da EPA -AR para a população brasileira visa fornece r evidências da confiabilidade e validade da nossa versão do instrumento.

As perspectivas futuras do presente trabalho envolvem ampliar a amostra de pacientes com TP sintomáticos para a validação da EPA -AR; ampliar a amostra dos pac ientes submetidos a TERV e desenvolver novos ambientes virtuais para exposições em contextos diferenciados como filas de espera, elevadores e outros ambientes altamente ansiogênicos para pacientes com TP."]}

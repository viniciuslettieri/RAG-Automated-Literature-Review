It aims to rightly and timely pair and deliver the treatments to each patient (Hopp et al., 2018) . The field of precision medicine was propelled by the completion of the Human Genome Project (HGP) in 2003, a collective effort to map our genome (National Human Genome Research Institute, n.d.) . Despite being completed 20 years ago, scientists are still working with HGP data on how to improve our health, predict and prevent diseases, and prevent aging, among other applications. Precision medicine takes into consideration the unique attributes of individuals, like biomarkers, genetics, demographic characteristics, and other covariates (Alemayehu & Cappelleri, 2012) . It contrasts with the one-size-fits-all medicine approach, which takes into consideration the responses of the averag e individual to develop prevention and treatment strategies (MedlinePlus, n.d.) . However, precision medicine is not the product of the work of a solo actor, and it requires the coordinated work of multiple actors. Therefore, there are many uncertainties permeatin g the development of precision medicine. Some of those uncertainties will be explored throughout this work. Hence, it opens an avenue to use two frameworks that usually are not presented together: Ecosystem Analysis and Scenario Planning.", "Precision medicin e and personalized medicine are terms that started appearing in academic publications and news articles at the end of the 90s (Jørgensen, 2019) . The first references to precision medicine in the management business literature started in the second half of the 2000s (see e.g. Aspinall & Hame rmesh (2007) , Ioannidis (2009) , or Amir -Aslani & Mangematin (2010) ). It coincides with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and U.K. Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) approval of Herceptin® as an early -stage treatment for patients HER2 positives in nonmetastatic breast cancer (Aspinall & Hamermesh, 2007; Kukk et al., 2016) . Precision medicine also gained momentum after the United States launched the Precision Medicine Initiative, deploying resources to boost research and technology advancements (The White House, 2015) . The American initiative and others developed worldwide have propelled the precision medicine market, which in 2021 was valued at USD 66.1 billion, and it is forecasted to reach USD 175,64 billion in 2030 (Precedence Research, 2022) . This work explores the future of precision medicine from a business perspective. We show that the development of precision medicine is the product of the work of an entire ecosystem dedicated to expanding the field. We also developed four scenarios aiming to understand the possible business outcomes of the precision medicine ecosystem in the next five years.", "We use systematic literature review and interviews to identify and map the precision medicine ecosystem's actors and driving forces. Then, we plot four scenarios based on the two main uncertainties of the precision medicine ecosystem: Business Model and Ethics & Bioethics. We describe the outcomes and implications of each scenario as well as the early warnings that indicate the shift of the business environment towards one of the scenarios. It is important to highlight that scenario planning does not aim to forecast the future. Instead, it is a tool that helps managers to foresee an array of plausible situations in different contexts (Amer et al., 2013; Durance & Godet, 2010) .", "This paper has the following objectives: (a) advance knowledge about precision medicine from a business strategy perspective; (b) deepen the knowledge of how the business ecosystem theory can work in conjunction with scenario planning techniques, and (c) lay out a unified definition of precision medicine. This work also aims to help healthcare researchers, practition ers, and enterprises to think about their strategies toward precision medicine in the next five years.", "2 LITERATURE REVIEW", "Precision medicine interconnects different industries that contribute to its advancement. In this work, we combine two theoretical frameworks, ecosystem analysis and scenario planning, to investigate the future business outcomes of precision medicine. There are two reasons to choose this combination. First, since precision medicine comprises a multi -actor network, ecosystem analysis is a tool to map the different actors participating in it (Tsujimoto et al., 2018) . Second, scenario planning is a tool to develop strategies considering not only trends but also uncertainties, which can aid the quick adaptation to major changes in the business landscape and open space to innovation (Amer et al., 2013) . In the following sections, we present a brief overview of precision medicine, business ecosystem, and scenario planning.", "2.1 PRECISION MEDICINE", "There are many different approaches to precision medicine. It ranges from the development of a personalized drug dosage or vaccine for an individual to the stratification of a population according to genetic characteristics. Precision medicine also receives different names, such as personalized medicine, stratified medicine, and predictive medicine (Antoñanzas et al., 2015; Kukk et al., 2015) . All lead to the same interpretation: precision medicine is the tailoring of the course of care", "based on the patient’s clinical, genetic, and environmental information (Antoñanzas et al., 2015) . The use of the patient’s genetic information to tailor the course of care results in more effective and efficient treatments, with fewer adverse drug reactions is a game changer, especially for cancer treatments (Kukk et al., 2016) . The reduction of treatment side effects and the increase in effectiveness result in more cost-efficient treatments that spill over to a reduction of government and private payer spending while increasing the overall populational health and patient care (Alcenat et al., 2021; Aquino et al., 2018) . Precision Medicine is much more than just treating each person according to their uniqu e characteristics. It can also be a tool to develop public policies benefiting entire populations, bringing savings or better -informed expenditures to public and private health systems. Therefore, we propose a new definition: Precision Medicine is the use of a combination of clinical, genetic, environmental, and other relevant patient/populational information to develop tailored treatments, drugs, vaccines, and preventive actions and protocols. It brings increased efficacy, reduced side effects and can be applied from an individual to entire populations.", "Precision medicine does not only focus on treatment but also on early detection and disease prevention, which also holds promises to reduce governmental healthcare expenditure (Betcheva et al., 2021) . Precision Medicine also unfolds over other areas like the development of new molecular and genetic diagnostics, bioprinting of organs, and in situ gene sequencing. Wearables and other monitoring sensors also greatly aid the development of precision medicine. Those devices are designed to collect data on the go and produce an enormous database of real-life evidence for scientists to understand better how our body and mind work. This convenient model of data collection opens space to other forms of personalized care, like digital therapies and wellness apps. These applications are one of the many examples of the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare and precision medicine. These examples show us that precision medicin e is not limited to the healthcare and pharmaceutical sectors but spills over to other industries, which means that precision medicine opens space for others to participate in it, such as big techs, internet platforms, wearables, and sensor developers and most important of all we as providers of data and information to feed this integrated structure that aims to deliver us the best care to match our needs.", "2.2 BUSINESS ECOSYSTE M", "In his seminal work on business ecosystems, Moore (1993) suggests that a company should not be seen as part of a single industry but as part of a business ecosystem since they depend on partnerships with suppliers, investors, and customers to thrive. As the different actors interact, they", "compete and cooperate to innovate and offer new products satisfying their customers (Moore, 1993) . Later on, Adner (2017) introduces the concept of ecosystem -as-structure: the ecosystem should start with a value proposition, and the analysis consists in identifying the actors that interact to bring the value proposition to life, as well as the relations among these actors. He proposes that the relations in the ecosystem are established based on the activities that the actors undertake to build upon the value proposition. These activities have a specifi c flow, and the links among the actors are based on transferences, which limits the actors participating in the ecosystem. Finally, Tsujimoto et al. (2018) introduce the multi -actor network perspective (MNP), which allows for the inclusion of a broad array of actors who are not necessarily confined to the limits of an organization or even an industry. They also say that relations between actors can be established through different channels like knowledge, power, money, regulation, contracts, and historical relationships. The relations among actors do not follow a set of rules; they are dynamic. Our understanding is that to develop a scenario planning for precision medicine, we need to have a broad perspective regarding the actors participating in it. Therefore, the MNP is the best approach to analyzing the precision medicine ecosystem. MNP considers that relations among actors are dynamic. It allows for the inclusion of actors that are not bound by a single industry but play a role in the development of the ecosystem, such as entrepreneurs, private investors, government, policymakers, and users (Tsujimoto et al., 2018) .", "2.3 SCENARIO PLANNING", "Scenario planning is a valuable tool for decision -makers in creating strategies to achieve long-term objectives (Borjeson et al., 2006) . The development of scenario plann ing allows for the systematic analysis of the interactions among trends and uncertainties surrounding businesses, helping them to identify strategic issues that can arise in a specific time frame (Schoemaker, 1991) . The classic example of scenario planning is its use by Shell in the 1970s, which helped them to avert major losses during the oil crisis (Amer et al., 2013; Durance & Godet, 2010) . It is important to highlight that, although scenario planning provides foresight, it does not predict the future (Durance & Godet, 2010; Schoemaker, 1991) . What scenario planning does in fact is to help decision -makers to broaden their perspective on the future by considering an array of plausible situations in different contexts (Amer et al., 2013; Durance & Godet, 2010) . Therefore, it is important to highlight that we are not trying to make previsions about the future of precision medicine, rather we are shedding light on possibilities of interest to those who are working in the field.", "We understand that the type of question posed by our work can be answered by developing explorative scenario s (Borjeson et al., 2006) . Explorative scenarios are built to explore what can happen with the development of a given context considering a wide variety of perspectives by working with a set of scenarios, even though the structure is unknown (Borjeson et al., 2006) . External scenarios also render the possibility to create general scenarios that can be used by any actor regardless of its capacity to influence the whole and can capture small signs of radical environmental changes (Borjeson et al., 2006) .", "3 RESEARCH METHOD", "Precision medicine is a very innovative field where new discoveries are published daily, which makes it a complex environment to develop strategies. The research question that guides this work is: “What is the five-year outlook for the precision medicine ecosystem?”. Our interest is to understand the factors that may hinder or help the development of precision medicine from a business perspective. We answer this question using a combination of literature review and qualitative research with in-depth interviews.", "We bring two theoretical lenses together to demonstrate the results of our research: business ecosystem analysis and scenario planning. The reason for this choice is twofold. First, the analysis of the precision medicine ecosystem helps us to identify the different actors, business and non-business alike, participating in it (Tsujimoto et al., 2018) . Second, scenario planning allows us to create multiple futures while overcoming the complexity and uncertainty offered by this ever-changing environment (Amer et al., 2013; Schoemaker, 1991) .", "Most scenario planning is done within a specific company. However, our approach here is to develop scenarios for a whole business ecosystem based on information collected from practitioners that are inside of what we name the Precision Medicine (PM) ecosystem. To convey this work systematically, the research process is divided into five steps, as shown in Figure 1.", "Figure 1 - Research Process", "Systematic Literature Review Ecosystem Interviews Scenario Planning Scenario Planning Validation Results", "3.1 SYSTEMATIC LITERATURE REVIEW", "The first step was to conduct a systematic literature review (SLR) to identify actors and trends (Schoemaker, 1991) in the PM ecosystem. We searched for articles in the SCOPUS database using the keywords “precision medicine\", \"personalized medicine\", and \"personalised medicine\". This first search resulted in 66,130 results. Then we filtered the results to show only pape rs from the subject areas “Business, Management and Accounting” and “Economics, Econometrics and Finance” since those are our areas of interest. The new query resulted in 1,078 documents. We further narrowed the search to bring only articles in English, which yielded 627 articles. We decided to narrow the search to papers published in the peer-reviewed journals of Business and Economics from Q1 journals1 because they sample the best works produced in the academy (Tsujimoto et al., 2018) . We ran this query on January 18, 2022, yielding 67 publication s. After that, we decided to include one more keyword, “predictive medicine”, which did not alter the results. Since SCOPUS does not have a filter for peer-reviewed articles, we conducted an additional screening to ensure that all articles were within this criterion. During the screening, we identified seven non-peer-reviewed articles, which we excluded. Then, we read and scanned the 60 selected articles for actors and driving forces of the PM ecosystem. Figure 2 provides visual summarization of the SLR filtering process.", "Figure 2 - Literature Review Filtering Process", "1 According to the Scimago Journal Rank", "3.2 BUSINESS ECOSYSTEM ANALYSIS", "The development of the scenarios presented in this work relies on the actors’ perspective of the developments of precision medicine in the next five years. These actors provide inputs to the development of the scenarios through interviews. Hence, we use business ecosystem analysis to identify the actors contributing to the development of precision medicine worldwide. We read the 60 articles in our SLR to map all the actors listed in academic works. We use the identified actors as a benchmark to which profe ssionals were invited to participate in interviews to collect information to develop the scenario planning. After we finished the interviews, we reviewed the first set of actors to include any new actors the interviewees may bring. As practitioners, the interviewees have further insights into actors participating in the PM ecosystem, adding to those portrayed in the literature we reviewed.", "We input the relations on Gephi (Bastian et al., 2009) , creating a graphic depiction of the actor’s network. We used eigenvector centrality to evaluate and understand the actors’ current relation to centrality in the PM ecosystem since it measures the influence that each node (actor) exerts in a network (ecosystem) (Grassi et al., 2007) . Description of each actor and their respective eigencentrality are in Appendix A.", "3.3 INTERVIEWS", "After identifying the actors, we moved to select and interview relevant actors of the PM ecosystem to collect their impressions on the future of precision medicine and which are the driving forces they see for the next five years.", "We conducted 17 in-depth interviews over the course of 3 months with actors within the PM ecosystem (Appendix B). The selected interviewees are practitioners and researchers from various backgrounds and experiences, and their work expertise is spread across South America, North America, and Europe. We prospected the interviewees through searches on LinkedIn, websites, news articles, and snowball sampling. The interview script (Appendix B) included five open questions where the participants were free to express their views and hopes. We recorded and transcribed all the interviews . We stopped interviewing after we reached saturation and worked with all the information collected to create four scenarios.", "3.3.1 Interview Analysis", "We analyzed the content of each interview to collect and understand driving forces of the PM ecosystem perceived by the interviewees. We used NViv o (QSR International Pty Ltd., 2020) to create and store the codes for driving forces and actors mentioned by the interviewees.", "3.4 SCENARIO PLANNING", "The information collected during the interviews allowed us to see the PM ecosystem through the lens of each actor. Our interviewees were linked with different actors in the PM ecosystem, which provided us with a multitude of views concerning the future of precision medicine, allowing us to capture a great variety of driving forces related to the possible future developments of precision medicine. We used information collected during the SLR and the interviews to guide our scenario planning.", "We use scenario planning because it allows the opportunity to combine reason and intuition to manage complex problems while paying attention to the sources of uncertainty (Schoemaker, 1991) . Traditionally, scenario planning is an activity developed inside a company and uses the view and opinions of the company’ s managers (Schoemaker, 1991) , key stakeholders, and experts in the process (Amer et al., 2013; Borjeson et al., 2006; Durance & Godet, 2010; Garvin & Levesque, 2006) . Here, we are doing it not for a single company but for the PM ecosystem. We conduct the scenario planning development using the minimal approach, using the two critical uncertainties identified by the actors interviewed to plot four scenarios (Amer et al., 2013) . We use the method described by Garvin and Levesque (2006) to guide the creation of the scenarios, which consists of (1) identifying the key focal issue, (2) identifying driving forces, (3) identifying critical uncertainties, (4) creating the scenario framework and its narratives, and (5) developing early warnings. Figure 3 summarizes the scenario planning steps.", "Figure 3 - Scenario Planning Steps", "Key Focal Issue Driving Forces Uncertainties Scenario Early Warnings", "3.4.1 Key Focal Issue", "The key focal issue states the scope around where the scenario planning will be developed and its timeframe (Garvin & Levesque, 2006) . Our key focal issue is identified by our research question: “What is the five-year outlook for the precision medicine ecosystem?” This question is relevant because each actor sees the landscape from their unique point of view. Here we bridge the view of multiple actors, bringing these views together. Our objective is to understand what are the drivers that can inhibit or propel the development of precision medicine from a business perspective.", "3.5 SCENARIO PLANNING VALIDATIO N", "To validate the generated scenarios, we followed Creswell and Miller (2000) procedure for validation of qualitative studies. We used the peer debriefing technique to validate the scenarios. We invited members of our research group to read and comment on the drivin g forces, critical uncertainties, scenarios, and early warnings in two different opportunities. We asked our validators to evaluate the critical uncertainties, scenarios, and early warnings under four criteria: consistency, plausibility, creativity, and relevance (Amer et al., 2013) .", "4 RESULTS", "In this section, we show the results of our analysis of the PM ecosystem and the scenario planning developed.", "4.1 THE PRECISION MEDICINE ECOSYSTEM", "Due to the need to understand who the players in precision medicine are, we choose the analysis of the PM ecosystem as the starting point of this work. We used the systematic literature review to map the actors in the existing literature. We identified 23 actors and used it as a guide to select the individuals invited to be our interviewees. We kept identifying actors during the interview process, from which we identified two other actors: Judiciary System and Big Techs & Internet Platforms. They were added to the existing ones.", "After identifying the actors, we assembled a visual representation of the PM Ecosystem, as shown in Figure 4. We listed the actors of each paper and created direct relations among them. We did it for all the papers in our SLR, creat ing an actor -relation data basis from the literature. Then we proceeded to the information collected from the interviews. We listed the actors mentioned by each interviewee and created direct relations amongst them, creating an actor -relation data basis from the interviews. After that, we merged the two actor -relation data basis and removed the repeated links, yielding 218 unique relations2.", "Figure 4 - Precision Medicine Ecosystem", "2 For detailed information regarding the links among the actors, please refer to Appendix C", "Between the literature review and interviews, we identified 25 actors. Our analysis of the graphic representation also shows that the PM ecosystem is very interconnected. The actors are no more than two connections away from each other.", "The actor with the highest eigenvector centrality is Patients. Thus, they are the actor with the strongest influence in the PM ecosystem. Following Patients, we have Traditional Pharmaceutical Industry, Citizens, Academic & Research Institutions, Government & Policy Makers, and New Pharmaceutical Industry, all with eigencentrality above 0.900. Next, in the 0.899 to 0.800 range, we have Diagnostic Industry and Services, Healthcare Professionals, Regulatory Agencies, Medical Technology Industry, Private Healthcare Institutions, Private Healthcare Payers, Gene Sequencing Services, and Public Funding Agencies. They are still close to the center and well -connected, exerting significant influence. Then, from 0.799 to 0.700, there are Private Investors, Genomic Database, Big Techs & Internet Platforms, Public & Accou ntable Care Organizations (ACOs) Healthcare Payers, Public & Nonprofit Healthcare Institutions, and Wearables, Sensors, & Smartphone Industry. They are still close to the center but have less influence than the two first groups. Moving towards the fringes of the PM ecosystem, we have Wellness Industry, Food & Nutrition Industry, Media, and Judiciary, with eigencentrality ranging from 0.612 to 0.510. Finally, at the fringe of the PM ecosystem, we have Religious Organizations with 0.210 eigencentrality, which makes them, currently, the least influential actor in the PM ecosystem.", "It is worth remembering that ecosystems are dynamic, and the influence of each actor can change according to the circumstances presented. In the next section, we analyze how the influ ence of each actor can increase or decrease in different scenarios.", "4.2 SCENARIO PLANNING", "We worked through the literature review, interviews, and validation processes to identify and select the driving forces3 of the PM ecosystem. The main goal of our interviews was to collect the driving forces perceived by each of our interviewees. Having interviewed different actors gave us the opportunity to contrast and compare the similarities and differences in their views on the future of precision medicine. Throughout this work, we sorted 22 driving forces. From those, during our discussions and the validation process, we classified 16 as trends and six as", "3 Driving forces are trends and uncertainties that are likely to promote dramatic changes on the key focal issue (Garvin & Levesque, 2006).", "uncertainties.

The development of gene therapy led to discussions if we could use it not only to cure diseases but also to intentionally improve our bodies and minds (Mukherjee, 2016) . In the 1970s, the use of the recombinant DNA technique led the scientific community to discuss the bioethical consequences of its use. Some ground rules regarding the use of recombinant DNA were established at the Asilomar Conference in February 1975 (Isaacson, 2021; Mukherjee, 2016) .

It can restore a normal adult brain to be like a kid’s brain, which is much more responsible, with strong connections. Based on our studies, there is a possibility that our drug can create a person with superior intelligence.

And this increased intelligence can make them even more rich and intelligent differing from the rest of the population.” Interviewee5", "The exam ples collected during the interview process are one of the many open questions that precision medicine lies ahead of us.

Result -based payments imply risk sharing among pharmaceutical companies, healthcare professionals, and institutions regarding the outcome of the treatment delivered to the patient (Denicolai & Previtali, 2020; Levaggi & Pertile, 2020) . This outcome is defined at the level of the treatment/procedure or the patient’s condition (Denicolai & Previtali, 2020) .", "“Payers are like: How am I going to make the payment? How can I be sure that these patients are going to improve over time? Brazil seems to have started doing something like this with Novartis SMA5 therapy. They were making installment payments depending on the clinical outcome of the patients.” Interviewee4 “An initiative that is already happening in the private health sector in many places around the world is risk-shari ng contracts. That is what I think will make it possible. There is no budgetary space today in the Brazilian private health sector to bring a new technology without proving it efficient. The way I worked along with those who had genetic panels to sell, who had targeted therapy with immunological therapy, whatever…was to bring the logic that we will pay based on the results that the therapy brings. If it does not bring any results, we don't pay. […] I think that the risk-sharing contracts are an important drive for these things to gain scale.” Interviewee1 1 “Another thing that I would like to highlight, it is an improvement opportunity, and an uncertainty in that sense, is the risk sharing. When we decide to pay 2.5 million dollars for a drug to treat one patient, we need to be super sure that it will work. This sureness cannot be", "5 Spinal Muscular Atrophy", "• People demand laws that restrict the use of data and types of treatments that can be developed and approved for use to prevent issues with health and genomic data leaking, discrimination based on health data, and animal welfare .", "Result Based • Organizations and individuals opt out of health insurances and start to manage health costs themselves .", "• The use of tools to contin uously monitor patient s outside of healthcare facilities increases to ensure that patients are following the correct course of treatment and obtaining desired outcomes.", "• Data collection and information is at the center of everything, which increases the relevance of big techs and internet platforms in the ecosystem .", "Cost Based • Cost transparency increases to the point of being certified and audit able. • The use of internet of things (IoT), electronic health records (EHR ), and increased informatization leads health insurances to increase the efficiency of care, while reducing costs .", "• People prefer to pay based on the use they are making of the service, understanding that this could bring them saving s while receiving better services .", "5 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS", "In closing this work, it is essential to highlight similarities and differences we found between the literature and the interviews, our conclusions, and recommendations, as well as to expose the limitations of this research.", "First, of the 25 actors mapped in our ecosystem, 22 are shared between the SLR and the interviews. Only the literature depicts Religious Organizations as actors. Although Religious Organizations do not play a part, either helping or hindering, in our interviewee’s activities, the strength of those groups cannot be ignored. At any point in the future, if religious groups feel that scientific advancements may threaten their beliefs, they will pressure lawmakers and government s to pass laws prohibiting or restricting practices that they judge are against their religious values or dogmas.", "Second, our interviews brought two actors that we did not find in our SLR: Judiciary and Big Techs & Internet Platforms. Healthcare judicializ ation is a topic that has been debated mainly in Latin America (see, e.g., Andia & Lamprea (2019) and Vargas -Pelaez et al. (2019) ). In this work, healthcare judicialization refers to the situation when people that end up being denied treatment because the public or private health payers do not cover it turn to the judiciary to obligate the payer to cover the treatment. Circumstances like this are challenging not only for patients/citizens but also for health payers creating a gray area of who should pay for what. It is also true that health payers, public or private, will need to rethink their business models and review their payment and reimbursement practices in order to account for personalized treatments, including preventive ones such as genetic testing, to identify illnesses before people develop symptoms. Although necessary, this change is not easy. It will demand comprehensive studies showing that this change brings cost advantages to health payers and improve benefits to citizens/patients still needs to be developed.", "Third, the literature does not account appropriately for the impact of Big Techs & Internet Platforms as an actor in healthcare. We see that companies such as Apple, Amazon, Oracle, Alphabet, and Samsung, among others, are entering the healthcare market. Either by providing services such as ERH (Landi, 2022) , data storage, marketplace (Amazon Web Services, n.d.) , acquiring healthcare providers (Sorkin et al., 2022) , helping to collect research data and health care monitoring of patients’ daily lives, investing in healthcare ventures, AI for healthcare or extending human longevity (The Economist, 2022) . Big Techs & Internet Platforms are actors that tend to become more central in the PM ecosystem as more data is used to improve drugs, treatments, therapy, continuous monitoring, and decision -making. Fourth, it is important to highlight that actors such as the Traditional and New Pharmaceutical industries still play a massive role in all scenarios. However, they will likely pursue avenues that help them to lower their drugs and treatments’ R&D costs. This is highly connected to the use of technologies such as the ones provided by Big Techs and Internet Platforms. Diagnostic Industry and Services, Gene Sequencing Services, and Genomic Data Basis are actors that will also rise in importance with the development of precision medicine. With the rise of targeted drugs, we will also need to identify the individuals that can be treated by each given drug. Looking at the preventive side of precision medicine, it takes into account that based on the information given by genetic tests and medical counseling, people will change their habits, increasing exercise, eating healthy and increasing knowledge of", "their body’s reaction to these activities. This puts Wellness, Food & Nutrition and Wearables, Sensors, & Smartphone Industries in the spotlight. Evidence of this rise is that the global share of people using smartphones was 78.05% (Statista, 2022b) , and it is estimated that in 2022 we will reach 202.6 million users of smartwatches worldwide (Statista, 2022a) . Regarding the drivers of the PM ecosystem, most of them, 13 of 22, were shared among literature and interviews. However, there were some differences. None of our interviewees mentioned the use of nanotechnology. In contrast, in our SLR, we saw a few mentions of its use such as a driver to increase the precision of diagnostics and drug delivery (Canovas -Carrasco et al., 2018; Franiak -Pietryga et al., 2016; Serio et al., 2021; Stelzer et al., 2015) . In contrast, the articles in our SLR are silent regarding the movements towards acquis itions of startups by big pharmaceutical companies, the expansion of big techs to healthcare, healthcare activism, and populational precision medicine. Our interviewees also brought very innovative drivers such as autonomous robotic surgery, bioprinting of organs, xenotransplants, real -time individual molecular diagnostics, and in situ gene sequencing. The discussion presented above shows that from a methodological point of view, the combination of ecosystem analysis and scenario planning technics creates a rich protocol to look deep into a complex phenomenon, such as precision medicine, from a business strategy perspective. We showed that precision medicine is an intricate work of many actors and that none fully controls all variables surrounding the phenom enon. All actors interested in the development of precision medicine need to pay close attention to the drivers that may hinder or help its development, such as the ones we listed in this paper. Another contribution of this work is a unified definition of precision medicine from a strategic point of view. It is essential to point out that our work presents at least two limitations. First, this research considers the entire PM ecosystem, and the drivers may change if we focus on given areas of precision medi cine, such as rare genetic disorders, oncology, or chronic diseases. Second, our methodological design was to work only with SCOPUS data basis and to narrow the papers included in our SLR to the ones published in the peer -reviewed journals of Business and Economics from Q1 journals according to the Scimago Journal Rank. Future research should aim to understand if the actors and driving forces change depending on the area of precision medicine considered. Also, it would be interesting to see how the scenario planning changes when considering different specialty areas of precision medicine, as previously mentioned.", "Finally, precision medicine is still in its infancy. The dissemination of precision medicine relies not only on developing new drugs and treatments but also on the notion that preventing diseases is better than treating them. This means that the collective mindset needs to shift from riveting on curing diseases to focusing on preventing them before their development. Understanding early on that this is the pathway leading to better and more equitable healthcare allows businesses to prepare for what may lie ahead in terms of scientific discoveries and business model development. It is also important to highlight that many nations are only consumers of precision medicine technology developed in other countries. Therefore, the democratization of access to precision medicine cannot be a work only of private institutions. It is paramount for Governments to invest in research funding and its healthcare syste m infrastructure. In this way, it will allow precision medicine research to be translated into practice and have proven use in improving the quality of life of entire populations. The development of precision medicine from niche care to mainstream also pass through the dissemination of knowledge about its implications and benefits among all health professionals, patients, and citizens. It means nothing to develop great treatments and drugs if awareness is not spread among people delivering the care and, mos t importantly, among patients and the general population, who are the ones directly impacted by the shift that precision medicine can bring to healthcare.", "REFERENCES", "Adner, R.

Each block that entails different aspects that we consider to be important to be carefull y thought through the further development of precision medicine that will be presented below.", "Activism and Regulation expresses the concerns that, although precision medicine is bringing major advancements to the diagnosis and cure of diseases, it may not be accessible to all. Being only destined for the ones that can afford it. It is a call to action to think how the current healthcare inequality can be addressed, and not deepened, by the advancements of the new discoveries. It also brings the efforts of legislative and regulatory powers towards improving access and expedite approval of new drugs and treatments.", "Precision medicine “is only precise if it is available to all. You can assemble the best diagnostic structure, with the best biomarkers, highest sensibility, and specificity, but it means nothing if people cannot access it. […] the biggest challenge is to turn these technologies accessible to all.” Interviewee 4 To “make a really big impact on human health, it has to be at the public health level. These are treatments that can be given to any patient, regardless of where they live and how they live and their resources. You really must drive towards, you know, the nirvana for effective, cheap drugs for everybody.” Interviewee12 Another challenge faced by many people searching for healthcare is to deal with misdiagnose and the delay to receive proper care:", "“The patient goes to the doctor, but the doctor cannot understan d the symptoms. This doctor then sends the patient to the wrong specialist, perhaps an endocrinologist. It takes a whole year to get the appointment with the specialist to discover that it was the wrong one. Then the patient goes back to the queue and waits another year to get to another specialist. […] It happens with thousands of patients, not only rare diseases patients, but also patients with common diseases.” Interviewee9 “We witness an invisible crime in which people with ultrarare diseases, degenerat ive diseases, access healthcare through the same queue as people with mild hypertension. This is outrageous! It takes two years to get a consultation with a genetic counselor, and another", "number of years to get to cardiologist, speech therapist, physiother apist, in this wait people die without receiving proper care.” Interviewee9 Interviewees highlighted that the work of the patient advocacy groups, healthcare and professionals’ associations play a major role to raise awareness regarding more broad and equitable access to healthcare:", "“Also, I need to highlight our advocacy towards public policies. This is a very important work that will bring the necessary changes. It will put pressure in governments and policy makers towards a solution.” Interviewee9 “As it happens abroad, it will probably start here as well, communities of patients will start to exert pressure. Moms of children with rare diseases and such. I think that they can press hard on policy makers and the media. This sort of pressure works abroa d. Everything influences policy makers. I think that they will need to listen to healthcare professional associations, the academia, and representatives of patient’s rights.” Interviewee11 While the discussion regarding affordability and access is ongoing, patients in need of life saving care turn to justice courts to get the costs of their treatment covered: “Brazil is the classic example where some treatments are reimbursable and others not. So, when people cannot get their treatment reimbursed, they go to court and ask for it, and they get it.” Interviewee4 “The judicialization of products like Zolgensma, which reached more than 1 billion reais now in the first half of the year. I am against it, just so you know, I am against judicialization, but also I would judicialize for my son if I had no other option to access it. So that is clear, to save my son's life, I will go to court if the government does not accept it. Because that is our right, the right to life. However, I am against having the option of access only via judicial. This must be the last case. So, I think judicialization will put pressure on the government in a positive or negative way. The negative way I see today is that they want to limit access to new therapies. The positive way is to try to understand and transform this by technology transfer contracts, by public -private contracts to create sustainability, allowing more studies, which will grant more patents.” Interviewee9 “Judicialization is a big problem worldwide. […] people go to court to get access to therapies that do not have proven cost-benefit or do not have clear benefits.” Interviewee10 “You will see in the private sector a strong judicialization. To get access, here in Brazil, people with health insurance go to court.” Interviewe e11", "Interviewees pointed out that, government, policy makers and regulatory agencies are working on alternatives to improve financial accessibility and speedup the approval process of new drugs and treatments.", "“There's a big thing you can look it up in the US Health Care Affordability Act in the United States, where they're now trying to regulate drug pricing. So, you only get premium, you get a premium price for a shorter period of time. And then the Medicare and Medicaid contract negotiating drug prices like we do, for example, in the UK, right, when the buying medicine for the NHS.” Interviewee12 “I think the legislation is prepared for innovation. […] since 2019, when we were accepted in the Managing Committee of the ICH6, which is a forum of regulatory agencies that aim to harmonize norms for the development of new drugs. […] So, we already have much of what is expected, from a regulatory standpoint, […] the tendency is to make small adjusts, but I think that the regulatory framework is ready.” Inteview ee15 “Anvisa 's function is regulation for the production and use of pharmaceutical and biological inputs and of drugs in Brazil. The agency operates only when upon request . Companies that have an interest seek the Agency to ask for approval of the drug or input . The agency has the framework to treat all demands related to any type of medicine or technology, including precision medicine. Since the COVID -19 pandemic the agency has been working with continued submission where the company does not have to wait until the end of all stages of clinical trials to submit the application for approval. It can open the application for approval and submit documents as each step of the tests is carried out. And the use of the reliance system is under study, which is the dispen sation of some parts of the regulatory process when the drug has already been approved in another regulatory agency with standards equivalent to those of Anvisa . Reliance does not remove the need for the company to develop clinical trial in the Brazilian population, but in special circumstances it may be waived . […] The regulatory agency seeks to speed up regulatory processes. Anvisa is one of the agencies with the highest digitization and accessibility in the world. Anvisa was one of the first agencies in the world to approve emergency use of vaccines for COVID -19.” Interviewee16", "Business Model frameworks for healthcare are not evolving at the same pace as the new developments in the field. Although, we have new drugs, therapies and treatments offering", "6 International Council for Harmonization of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use", "more precision and greater personalization, the way of conducting the healthcare business has not changed. The managerial side of the health seems to be putting too much focus on costs but does not seem to perceive that new payment & reimbursement and new business models need to be developed to allow companies to keep thriving in the new environment that has been developing.", "There are three perspectives regarding costs of new drugs and treatments in precision medicine: (1) costs will increase, (2) costs will decrease, and (3) cost effectiveness will increase. Some believe that precision medicine has the tendency to increase the costs. Because many of these new biological compounds target very small groups of people and the risks taken by the companies to develop these drugs are too high.", "“Often these biological drugs, which are very costly, because they rely on advanced technology, they will be offered to a small group of people. […] Since you are proposing to treat specific groups, the number of people decre ase, the technology will increase, and the drug becomes more expensive.” Interviewee3 “Today there are several statistics, you can predict something among seven thousand rare diseases, that is, rare genetic diseases and of which less than 10% have treatmen t or therapy. So, this leaves a very small population to dilute your clinical development costs. […] So, you must dilute the cost of this treatment among a very small population. […] Those are biologic products. They have a much greater manufacturing compl exity which only makes this equation worse.” Interviewee4 “The clinical studies and the development of these products are still a major risk for companies. That is why they want to charge a lot of money for the product. Because in my view it is riskier. There is a greater chance do not work, than a product than a broad -spectrum synthetic drug. […] There is also uncertainty regarding the product being incorporated [to the list of approved treatments by public and private payers.]” Interviewee15 While other see an opportunity to cost reduction in healthcare:", "“Precision medicine will naturally lower the costs. It will avoid many medical errors, will avoid many imperfect diagnoses, will avoid unnecessary costs.” Interviewee2 “It a biomarker identification exam costs around tens of euros compared to hundreds of euros to make a single gene exam. So, that is a good example. To have biomarkers that can, with reasonable degree of certainty, say that that patient has or does not have a disease. So, you can perform screening in, let's assume, 30 patients at the price of one you do a single gene exam.” Interviewee4", "“If we get the genome sequencing at an affordable cost of $50, $100 dollars (USD) in the future , we will completely change the dynamics of the game. Because imagine the entire Brazilian population , upon birth , getting a complete genome sequencing potentially paid by the federal government or by the health insurance . With this we can identify well in advance potential risks of diseases , including polygenic diseases . When this happens , imagine the size of the budget reduction that you can have for a payer or even for the government if you can do treatments well in advance , with early diagnosis upon the birth of a person. So, this can have huge impacts and on the cost of health as a whole for payers.” Interviewee17 Lastly we have cost effectiveness that reconciles the two views above. There is no doubt that the costs of developing biological drugs and treatments is progressively higher. However, these drugs and treatments are more effective and lead to better outcomes to patients either because they are cured, and do not need further treatment, or because they have a great improvement and the need for care is reduced.", "“Being more precise means to have a good diagnosis. […] diagnostic accuracy will lead to more precision and, ideally as it happens in oncology, […] the diagnose will help to define the correct therapy. So, this selection ends up reducing the costs for the health system. Therefore, although the therapy is expensive, there is the benefit of having a high effectivity because the diagnostic was correct and gave you the right information.” Interviweee4 “We always aim to achieve higher cost effectiveness, but it is almost impossible to find something that is better and cheaper. We will be ending with something that it is better and more expensive. The challenge is to find interventions that are better and less costly compared with an alternative. For example, it is cheaper to prevent terminal diseases, like chronic kidney disease. However, if I start to screening for kidney diseases I will increase the number of patients in need of care, but I reduce the number of patients that will need kidney transplants, which is the most expensive intervention considering the realm of chronic kidney diseases.” Interviewee8 The interviewees offered two solutions for this dispute. One is to create a payment model in which payments are made to the laboratories offering the treatment based on the clinical outcomes of patients. In this model, healthcare providers, pharmaceutical companies and healthcare institutions share the risks of the treatments.", "“Payers are like: How am I going to make the payment? How can I be sure that these patients are going to improve over time? Brazil seems to have started doing something like this with Novartis SMA therapy. They were making installment payments depending on the clinical outcome of the patients.” Interviewee4", "“Another thing that I would like to highlight, it is an improvement opportunity, and an uncertainty in that sense, is the risk sharing. When we decide to pay 2.5 million dollars for a drug to treat one patient, we need to be super sure that it will work. This sureness cannot be based on the company’s allegations. The company has a bias, which is natural since it developed the product, and it is trying to sell it. […] This risk needs to be shared with the industry, meaning that you only pay if the results are inside the expected range.” Interviewee15 Two, is to develop a business model based on payment per use such as a subscription. “I think there is a lot going on to reduce your costs to deliver different modalities of service. Subscription system. […] You subscribe to our network, we have our few doctors, we do everything virtual and when you need the services we charge them separately or we offer them to you. And every patient that signs in, passes through this list here of tests. No hospital will give you this service. It is a model that monitors your health which is different from the other, is more structured.” Interviewee13 Others see that the solution lies in the decentralization of healthcare relying on specialized centers.", "“All these huge hospital complexes, which treats everything, regardless of the disease or problem […] will become white elephants. Because other models of hospitals will take their place. Smaller hospitals focused on disease groups. Offering a better characterization of the diseases , with precise diagnosis , and target therapies . You will see a lot of these models of innovation, utterly advanced to treat diseases.” Interviewee9", "Ethics and Resistance to Precision Medicine . Precision medicine, although promising, leaves room for many ethical questions and fierce opposition. The development of gene therapy led to discussions if we could use it not only to cure diseases, but also to intentionally improve our bodies and minds (Mukherjee, 2016) . In the 1970s, the use of DNA technique led the scientific community to discuss the bioethical consequences of its use. Some ground rules regardin g the use of recombinant DNA utilization were established at the Asilomar Conference on February 1975 (Isaacson, 2021; Mukherjee, 2016) . The advancements on genetic and genomics now and their possible uses are much greater than 50 years ago, so the ethical conundrum keeps moving further puzzling scientist, philosophers, and the society with the questions about the limits of precision medicine and genomics:", "“We did not invest in this kind of company because there is a huge ethical debate. You are raising a pig in captivity only to harvest its organs. From there, where are we going? There", "is always the question: Where is the limit? Now they raise pigs to harvest organs, soon they will be making genetically modified babies. This can get crazy.” Interviewee5 “We were able to increase the connections between neurons, increasing axons thickness, which can restore the brain of a person with Alzheimer back as it was a norm al brain. It can restore a normal adult brain to be like a kid’s brain, which is much more responsible, with strong connections. Based on our studies, there is a possibility that our drug can create a person with superior intelligence. So, this brings ethical debates like: If I sell it, I will allow rich people to get more intelligent just because they can pay for it. And this increased intelligence can make them even more rich and intelligent differing from the rest of the population.” Interviewee5 The limits of genomics are not the only topics at the center of the ethical debate. Technology walks hand -on-hand with precision medicine, and there are many questions concerning the privacy, sharing or hacking of patient/customer data.", "\"I think it's very important to have a patient database. However, this has a certain dang er, a very complex ethical discussion, which is whether this data would be used for example by an insurer. Because you put the patient in an unequal situation\" Interviewee10 “For us, any diagnostic exam that you do with us, either image, blood, or oral swab, we follow the same laws of data protection, LGPD7. According to the Brazilian legislation, you can only access and use anonymous health data. We only contact patients if they give us their consent.” Interviewee17 There are people that have objections to precision medicine not because its ethical implications, but because its progress may hinder their way of practicing medicine: “The traditional education of the physician is to make money for sick people. Anything that can eradicate a disease or reduce it, even unconsciously, the health professional will be against it. Even more professionals, like me, graduated from medical school in the previous century. There are many colleagues that are still practicing medicine and they keep what they learned 50 years ago, they did not move forward. So, that is this sort of professional that holds progress.” Interviewee2", "Precision Medicine Outcomes. The great promise of precision medicine is to deliver better diagnosis and treatment tailored for each patient’s needs . There are at least four different levels in which precision medicine is being developed. The first one is precision medicine as", "7 Lei Geral de Proteção de Dados Pessoais – General Personal Data Protection Law", "an instrument to diagnose and cure a disease with increased accuracy. The second one is the use of precision medicine tools to prevent or delay the onset of a malady. The other two levels consider that the tailoring of care can happen at two instances individual and population. These four levels permeate all the instances of precision medicine from the development of personalized treatments for each individual to the genetic sequencing of a whole population to understand underling health risk factors.", "The key to improving prognosis, diagnostics and treatments lies in the understanding of the mechanism of the diseases, identifying the biomarkers that best characterize it and developing less invasive diagnostic procedures.", "“You want to find out, but in a very fundamental level, what's wrong with people so we can design treatments that are mechanism based. This is an incredibly importa nt principle in precision medicine: when you understand what's wrong with someone, you can work out what the treatment is.” Interviewee12 \"We will begin to see more molecular diagnosis than a histopathological diagnosis. Molecular diagnosis can be based on gene expression, specific mutations, fusions, etc. \" Interviewee1 \"What is trending now is the use of gene expression to have insights about prognosis, better treatments, diagnosis and everything else. It is also a trend to use samples obtained from noninvasive forms of blood, saliva, urine, and other body fluids for you to do a biopsy. Known as liquid biopsy.\" Interviewee1 Another landmark of precision medicine is the development of personalized treatments and targeted therapies which hold promises of reducing adverse side effects with its increased precision.", "\"Are we moving towards individualized treatm ent? Yes. The is to have the genetic mapping of each individual, in addition to the epigenetics, you should. They are capable of generating different circumstances for the response of that particular individual to a common therapy. This is the first phase and the second phase, is to develop match the best treatment with the genetic information such as: for genetic A, you have an A' treatment. For genetics B, a B' and so on\" Interviewee11 \"I think we will start to see a lot of therapies linked to mutations. That is a trend. [...] I think this is going to increase a lot. More and more we will see cancers being treated molecularly. Not histological, as we see now. [...] There will be more mutation -related drugs.\" Interviewee1", "“The reason why I went from academics to a pharmaceutical company, for the last part of my career, is that I wanted to invent some new treatments that really made it into patients or use diagnostics to more effectively use to target drugs, when we get into clinical investigation s so we can really take those new drugs and put them into sensitive populations and get to see success very, very early on in that drug's life. So, one thing that precision medicine does for drug development is you see responses in patients the first time these drugs go into a patient, that's transformational.” Interviewee12 \"In 10 years, you go to the doctor, he will not ask you for blood work. Well, he can ask, but he is going to ask for a genetic sequencing that will cost the same as blood work today. It is not going to cost much. Why? Because he will work with you using target therapies.\" Interviewee9 \"Nowadays it is very clear the success rate pipelines drug studies when it has a genetic basis connecting to a target: molecule, protein, gene. If this molecule has a genetic connection demonstrated to the disease, the success rate is much higher. So much, that many companies nowadays no longer develop drugs if they do not have a proven genetic basis.\" Interviewee13 \"I think a big change that will happen is the reduction of side effects of therapies, of new therapies. We will be able to not only improve the people’s life quality, but also increase their life expectancy.\" Interviewee5 There is also an ongoing discussion about the size of the trial cohorts. Since the drugs are becoming more and more specific, the number of individuals that can be subject to clinical trials is also reduced. Some argue the this shows an improvement in the drug development, reducing its time-to-market, while others think that that the lack of data harms the analysis of treatment effectiveness:", "“Targeted drugs, that's how you get to more effective and less toxicity because it goes to the target, it doesn't you don't get by standard biological inhibition. So that's what toxicity is due to, isn't it? It's the off-target effects of a drug. If you're on target, you could have less toxicity. So that's related to less toxicity. And the dose response stuff that accelerates drug development. You know, the best example is that Gleevec. They knew they had a drug that they should approve within the first 50 patients. Usually, it's maybe hundreds or thousands of patients before you know whether something's going to work or not.” Interviewee12 \"It is not enough just to make sense. It needs to give results. So, while it is not proved that the drug works, it is not ethical to put it on the market. We are seeing more and more FDA fast track approvals, releasing therapies like that. Why is that? Because they have a great appeal. Because they're indiv iduals who will die within a year. Do you understand? Or these", "are individuals who have rare diseases that you will not be able to assemble a well-organized number necessary to treat, a nice sized sample for evaluation.\" Interviewee11 \"Often times the development of these new product s is insufficient, but promising. Insufficient in the sense of population sample. When we are talking about the drugs for ultra - rare disease, we will have small samples. There are cases where we have 11 patients in the whole country. So, to generate tracking data or data that is bulky enough for a robust decision, you need time, you need to follow up on those few people.\" Interviewee15 Another topic brought by our study participants was populational precision medicine and preventive medicine. They suggest that populational precision medicine and preventive medicine can be solutions to improve people’s health while reducing costs for public and private payers:", "\"It is good to make it clear that precision medicine is not just medication. [...] We are creating and sharing knowledge about the genomic structure of the population which can influence various phenotypes. This can influence diseases, can influence the response to treatment. And this is the one thing that I think is essen tial for middle -income countries. [...] In which ways do I think that precision medicine can help a country like Brazil, for example? Brazil, Mexico, Turkey, these countries that are there in the middle -income range. It uses genetic information for risk stratification and from there to act on preventing diseases that are preventable. This is what is called precision public health [...] And that up front would lead to a reduction of these diseases associated with obesity, diabetes and even cancer. […] And we would be doing something that would have a real impact in terms of improving the health of the population and probably reducing public spending. Why prevent ? Because preventive programs are much cheaper.\" Interviewee3 \"Imagine genetic counseling performin g early diagnosis in a baby before being born. Identifying early risks of developing kidney diseases. That goes for any disease, but I'm going to use kidney disease. And that the child eventually is born with that gene, that mutation, which will increase the risk of the disease. This child, in an individualized intervention, should receive adequate guidance regarding life habits, what to eat and what sort of medications should be avoided. Medications can have very harmful effects on the progression of kidne y disease. […] So, associating with a cutting -edge genetic technology with low-cost interventions such as nutritional guidance, which is not always done by physicians, in fact it should be done by professionals like dieticians. This is an example of a comb ined action that would lead to effective personalized medicine.\" Interviewee8", "“Create a database of a Brazilian population with Brazilian gene variants is mandatory . Why is that? The large st global exam databases that are created and validated are with information of European /Caucasian populations. So often when we perform an exam in a population like ours and we compare to see the positivity rate versus the database of a European population that exam ends up not being so reliable. [...] When it comes to Brazil , we are a very diverse, a little bit of everything, a mixture . So, to have this Brazilian database, with Brazilian variants, with the Brazilian population is essent ial for us to have an increasing accuracy of our genetic tests.” Interviewee 17 Research and Education are central topics to the future of precision medicine. Essentially, precision medicine is sustained by a stream of edge innovation research. This steam is feed by data collected either on clinical trials or during patient’s visits to clinics and hospitals. However, the new advancements presented by precision medicine will be of little to no use if the healthcare professionals are not educated and trained in the newest developments of the field.", "Data is a foundational piece of precision medicine. Its models are data hungry (Miller et al., 2014) and healthcare researcher strive to get more information from patients/consumers. That is why electronic health records (EHR) are so important for precision medicine. They allow for not only the collection of real-world data that contribute to eviden ce-based medicine, but also the sharing of clinical and genomic information for the development of research: \"One crucial step to the development of precision medicine is our capacity to collect data on a large scale. [...] . Access to large cohorts of well-characterized individuals [...] We need integration, data sharing is a must. So, we need to create infrastructure with electronic health records. Stop with this paper chart thing.\" Interviewee3 \"We bring treatment customization to also help the health professional to choose what is the ideal drug and the course of treatment. We have drug management apps and algorithms to help integrate with biometric sensor. We are developing our wearable electroencephalogram. We integrate with Samsung Health. Our goal is to bring biometric data, heartbeats, steps, to understand more and more and bring more and more evidence to science. \" Interviewee7 \"In the United States, I think that the fraction of electronic health records is very high. Without this transformation we would not have precision medicine. That had to happen. Clearly, we have one or two leaders who have established the systems and have virtually a monopoly over it, but they have set standards. So, nowadays, there are APIs with very clear standards of how to interact with the systems and increasingly facilitate the integration of", "different components. These components may not be solely health system or the diagnostic center, but the therapeutic company itself that is participating in it or other institutions. \" Interviewee13 EHR can also give power to patients/ consumers to take their data to new service providers or even to new countries allowing them to get better treatment and reducing the need of extensive handwritten health surveys.", "\"The patient must be able to take his data anywhere. The patient is the owner of the data, it is not the doctor, it is not the nurse, nor the pharmacist. It's the person , the person's choice. So, you are living in New York, and you moved to Brazil. You must bring your health database. And I think in the future we will have an API that integrates all the health databases, not only national databases. That's what I think, what I believe.\" Interviewee10 This massive health data collection and advanced research helps to further the care personalization because it allows researchers to stratify patients to match them with the best therapy, drug, or preventive protocol according to their health profile. “In which ways do I think that precision medicine can help a country like Brazil, for example? Brazil, Mexico, Turkey, these countries that are there in the middle -income range. It is using genetic information for risk stratification and from there to act on preventing diseases that are preventable.” Interviewee3 \"They know that these people are from this cluster here, these people are from this other. Within this, already with a number of patients, they can basically apply analyses to sub stratify and learn: Okay, within this group here what are the different types? And what works best for each of them? Then again it becomes a cluster. As the customer portfolio increases it can sub stratify even more. So, it is really a very strong optimization model. That really can be the kind of thing that has a network effect, winner takes most.\" Interviewee13 Education and training of healthcare professionals are keys to make the research and developments on precision medicine arrive to the patients. This education and training must consider that precision medicine is not delivered by a single provi der, but by a team of professionals from different areas.", "\"We work hard to modify this scenario especially in the research area. It has changed a lot. We also work on ongoing education. Two months from now we will inaugurate the first Center for Integral Care and Training in Rare Diseases in Latin America[...]. The first center where you will have quick and qualified diagnosis. It is an interdisciplinary team that will work with these patients. We will work with the public and private health payers. We will take care of everyone, so we can change the natural history of these diseases.\" Interviewee9", "Technology is a huge driver of precision medicine. In many ways it is the enabler of the rapid advancement in precision medicine research. According with our interviewees, big data, machine learning, artificial intelligence (AI) is the triad that moves precision medicine research and development further not only in the laboratories, but also the growing number of platforms of health management and digital therapy tailoring the care delivered to us. The motor behind these technology driven side of healthcare is bioinformatics, field that started to develop in the early 1960s as a computational method to analyze protein sequencing and kept evolving together with DNA sequencing and now with biological big data (Gauthier et al., 2019) . Being precision medicine hugely based on data, it is natural to see information technology companies, big techs and telecoms moving towards the precision medicine ecosystem with great interest. Also newly formed companies are using AI, machine learning and big data to develop and proof new drugs, therapies, and diagnostics:", "\"We use artificial intelligence, machine learning. I think this is also growing in healthcare. Even in genomics and precision medicine. So, machine learning is fundamental in this area today, and here we use it. We take the gene expression index, and we use machine learning to try to find patterns. We use biopsy results, histopathological results , as standards to train the algorithm.\" Interviewee1 \"Everything will move forward with bioinformatics. For example, to know what you can edit with CRISPR, you must have bioinformatics . To know how to make a CAR -T cell for solid tumor, you must have bioinf ormatics. Everything, in my vision, everything or almost everything will come from bioinformatics .\" Interviewee5 \"We see remote monitoring, IOT, wearable technologies, remote data collection. Home care, customization to the extreme. Decentralization of the health system. That is what call consumerization of the health system. So, it is becoming more and more consumer and less medical. We see it becoming more and more hybrid. So, we see Samsung, Apple, Google getting FDA, Anvisa approv al to monitor this and that.\" Interviewee7 \"If you have a database with APIs you will be able to do data mining and add artificial intelligence into the system. The AI will learn what is going on happening in these small databases or, if possible, in a larger database. We will learn much more from it. Much more epidemiological basis, much more understanding of everything that is happening. Today, we already have pathological, dermatological, radiological, ophthalmological and many others artificial intellig ence systems showing equal or superior results compared to physicians.\" Interviewee10", "Although we may not perceive it, technology is what is bringing precision medicine to people’s daily lives. From smartwatches to health and wellness platforms, we are continuously feeding data into models to make these applications understand us better and help us to make informed decisions regarding our health.", "\"Our technology is based on medical software. So, we are classified as digital therapeutics. [...] We bring treatment customization to also help the health professional to choose what is the ideal drug and the course of treatment. We have drug management apps and algorithms to help integrate with biometric sensor. We are developing our wearable electroencephalogram . We integrate with Samsung Health. Our goal is to bring biometric data, heartbeats, steps, to understand more and more and bring more and more evidence to science.” Interviewee7 \"I really like the Omada’s8 model. I have seen them, it is phenomenal. When you sign up for their platform, you become a participant, you are a member and they connect you with a group of people who are in a similar situation like yours, similar health characteristics, similar issue that you are dealing with. This group of people work with dedicated health professionals , with activities, creating some peer pressure. They have a platform where you enter your information every day, your weight, if you had your medications and everything. As you improve, you will achieve some goal that you had, like, reduce weight or improve your consistency in taking your medication, and they move you to another group.\" Interviewee13 The use of artificial intelligence in healthcare also open space to innovations like robotic surgery:", "\"The other thing that I think is in our future is that surgeries, all of them, are becoming increasingly less invasive. You can operate a robot from a distance. For you to have security in this you will obviously need to have lower latency time, greater security, so maybe this transmission must be done by satellite. Some things like that. I see in a not-so-distant future, people performing surgeries remotely and artificial intelligence learning how perform surgery. I believe that further ahead, we will have a trained surgeon operating remotely, and a beginner in the room. And later on, a robot operated with a surgeon just watching. That is what I imagine in relation to these procedures\" Interviweee10", "8 Omada https://www.omadahealth.com/"]}

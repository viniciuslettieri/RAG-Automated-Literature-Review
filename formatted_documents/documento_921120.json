CALCULATION OF MASS TRANSPORT COEFFICIENTS OF HYDROCARBONS/CO 2MIXTURES VIA MOLECULAR DYNAMICS Thiago Jos\u0013 e Pinheiro dos Santos September/2019 Advisors: Frederico Wanderley Tavares Charlles Rubber de Almeida Abreu Graduate Program: Engineering of Chemical and Biochemical Processes During the last decade, the Brazilian oil industry has faced major engineering challenges in the Pre-salt reserves, including the high carbon dioxide content in the gas and oil fractions. This scenario sets the need for the determination relevant prop- erties of hydrocarbon/CO 2mixtures under reservoir conditions. While experimental measurements at high pressures are costly and di\u000ecult to perform, molecular simu- lations have increasingly established itself as a tool that enables the study of these systems of interest. Thus, in the present work we employed equilibrium Molecular Dynamics simulations to study the self-di\u000busion and mutual di\u000busion phenomena in hydrocarbons and hydrocarbons/CO 2mixtures at high pressures. More than just determining properties, this work aims to evaluate and propose solutions to problems commonly found in molecular simulation approaches, such as the force \feld limitations and the so-called \fnite-size e\u000bect of the simulation boxes. We will show that the \fnite-size e\u000bect is pronounced for the case of the self-di\u000busivity under high pressures, which can be considerably mitigated by the well-established Yeh- Hummer correction factor. However, di\u000berent force \felds may introduce new e\u000bects that may turn the corrected self-di\u000busivities worsen if compared to experimental data. Concerning the Fick di\u000busion coe\u000ecients, we will show a new approach to the computation of these coe\u000ecients by a single calculation in the Fourier domain through equilibrium simulations. This new technique proved to be very promising and allows the determination of the mutual di\u000busivities in the thermodynamic limit condition, considerably mitigating the \fnite-size e\u000bects. vii Contents List of Figures x List of Tables xiv List of Symbols xvi List of Abbreviations xviii 2 Self-di\u000busion coe\u000ecients of methane/n-hexane mixtures at high pressures: an evaluation of the \fnite-size e\u000bect and a comparison of force \felds 8 3 Fick di\u000busion coe\u000ecients for n-alkanes/CO 2mixtures via Molecular Dynamics: an alternative approach in the Fourier Domain 36 viii A Supplementary Material from Chapter 2 71 B Supplementary Material from Chapter 3 86 C Supplementary Material 100 ix List of Figures 2.1 Self-di\u000busion coe\u000ecients of methane(1) in methane(1)/n-hexane(2) mixtures at 333.1 K, obtained with OPLS-UA Force Field.

Despite pre-salt oil having good quality, pre-salt reservoirs have a high carbon dioxide content, and it is not uncom- mon to \fnd gas reservoirs where the CO 2content is higher than the hydrocarbons portion [3]. Among the main engineering challenges found in pre-salt, it is possi- ble to highlight: (i) the 2000 meters layer of salt that precedes the reservoirs and the di\u000eculties that it brings to wall-drilling; (ii) the heterogeneity of the microbial carbonaceous reservoirs of the oil basins; (iii) the need for new subsea engineering technologies; (iv) the problems with hydrate formation, para\u000en and asphaltenic depositions and other ow assurance issues; (v) the high CO 2content in the wells and the problem of compositional grading in the reservoirs [4]. As discussed by Beltr~ ao et al. (2009) [5], the pre-salt engineering challenges also cover the stages after oil and gas production. Due to the high content of contaminants in gas and oil, including water, CO 2and H 2S, the use of anti-corrosive materials and of processing units that are not typical of most o\u000bshore platforms is required. Several options are available for the removal of carbon dioxide, including membrane separation and extraction units employing primary amines [5, 6]. It is clear that the di\u000busivities of the hydrocarbon and carbon dioxide mixtures at high pressures are crucial for the success of the engineering challenges encountered in these cases.", "1.1 Motivations and Reasoning", "Mass transport phenomena are quite recurrent in the oil-and-gas industry, from the study of compositional gradation in reservoirs to the processes of separation and puri\fcation of oil and natural gas. According to Esp\u0013 osito et al. (2016) [7], the understanding and proper description of self-di\u000busion, mutual di\u000busion and thermodi\u000busion phenomena is fundamental for the complete modeling of the mass transfer processes of interest to the oil industry, especially for reservoir engineering. Necessarily, the proper description of these mass transport phenomena requires the accurate determination of the di\u000busion coe\u000ecients in the mixtures of interest under reservoir or at post-exploratory operations conditions [8]. A natural way of determining mass transport coe\u000ecients is through experimental measurements. Some of the main techniques for the experimental determination of mass transport properties are the pressure decay methods and their variants [9, 10], the dynamic light scattering methods [11, 12] and other techniques such as the Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) [13]. Nevertheless, experimental measurements of mass transport coe\u000ecients under reservoir conditions are often costly and di\u000ecult to perform; thus, more viable and less expensive alternatives are required. In this context, Molecular Dynamics represents a tool with great potential, in order to corroborate the experiments and enable the study of systems of interest in cases where the experiments are di\u000ecult to be executed.", "Although there are several well-established methods in Molecular Dynamics, there exist intrinsic limitations of these approaches that may compromise the proper calculation of mass transport coe\u000ecients. Some of these issues are well known, such as the limitation of some force \felds on the calculation of transport properties. Other problems have been better discussed in recent years, such as the so-called \fnite-size e\u000bect of the simulation box, that occurs due to long range hydrodynamic interactions that are not properly accounted in the system because the simulation box is small and periodic [14, 15].", "Self-di\u000busion and mutual di\u000busion phenomena arise from the momentum trans- fer through collisions of one molecule with the others in its surrounding, creating hydrodynamic ows between the solutes. These hydrodynamic ows play an impor- tant role in the di\u000busion process, and represent a practical limitation on molecular simulations because the hydrodynamic interactions between periodic images do not properly reproduce the bulk media [16]. In addition to the mass transport proper- ties, several other properties computed via Molecular Dynamics that can provide a rigorous framework of the thermodynamic properties of the systems appear to su\u000ber, to a greater or lesser extent, with the \fnite-size e\u000bect, such as the radial distribution function (RDF) and the Kirkwood-Bu\u000b integrals [17{19].", "1.2 Research Objectives", "The main goal is to calculate self-di\u000busion and Fick di\u000busion coe\u000ecients of hy- drocarbon and CO 2/hydrocarbon mixtures at reservoir conditions using Molecular Dynamics simulations.

As experimental measurements of these prop- erties can be costly and hazardous, Molecular Dynamics simulations emerge as an alternative approach. In this work, we used Molecular Dynamics to calculate the self-di\u000busion coe\u000ecients of methane/n-hexane mixtures at di\u000berent conditions, in both liquid and supercritical phases. We evaluated how the \fnite box size and the choice of the force \feld a\u000bect the calculated properties at high pressures. Results show a strong dependency between self-di\u000busion and the simulation box size. The Yeh-Hummer analytical correction [J. Phys. Chem. B, 108, 15873 (2004)] can at- tenuate this e\u000bect, but sometimes makes the results depart from experimental data due to issues concerning the force \felds. We have also found that di\u000berent all-atom and united-atom models can produce biased results due to caging e\u000bects and to di\u000berent dihedral con\fgurations of the n-alkane.", "2.2 Introduction", "The determination of mass transport properties has always been indispensable to the design of industrial processes and to chemical engineering as a whole [1]. Among its many applications, mass transport coe\u000ecients are important for separation and extraction processes, multiphase reactions, ow in porous media, and for several operations in the oil and gas industry [2{4]. Mass transport coe\u000ecients are also quite important for reservoir engineering because the compositional grading of oil reservoirs involves a good interpretation on the self-di\u000busion, mutual di\u000busion, and thermodi\u000busion processes at high pressures [5, 6]. In particular, the self-di\u000busion coe\u000ecient is useful for describing the structure and the thermophysical behavior of uids [7]. Unlike ordinary or mutual di\u000busion, the self-di\u000busion phenomenon occurs in the absence of a chemical potential gradient, when molecules collide with each other and di\u000buse simply due to Brownian motion [8{10].", "Experimentally, self-di\u000busion coe\u000ecients for both pure substances and mixtures are commonly determined through the well established pulsed \feld gradient NMR technique [11{13]. However, despite the need for transport coe\u000ecient data under reservoir conditions [13], experimental measurements for hydrocarbon systems at high pressures always present an inherent safety risk and high cost. In this context, Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation can be used to study the self-di\u000busive process of high-pressure systems [14, 15] without the mentioned problems of experimental measurements.", "There are two common approaches to calculate self-di\u000busion coe\u000ecients using MD simulations. The \frst one is based on the evaluation of the mean square dis- placement (MSD) of the molecules over time, whose slope is a constant directly proportional to the self-di\u000busion coe\u000ecient [8, 16]. This is commonly known as the Einstein relation [17], from which the self-di\u000busion coe\u000ecient of a component ican be computed as Di= lim NiNiX wheretis the time, Niis the number of molecules of component i, and rjis the center-of-mass coordinate of a molecule jof this component. The term inside curly brackets is the mean square displacement (MSD).", "The second approach to obtain self-di\u000busion coe\u000ecients via Molecular Dynamics relies on the so-called Green-Kubo relations [18, 19]. The self-di\u000busion coe\u000ecient depends intrinsically on the velocity autocorrelation function of individual particles [20], and this relation can be expressed by Di=1", "3NiNiX", "where vjis the velocity vector of each molecule jof typei. Both approaches consider the self-di\u000busion coe\u000ecient as an average along the three independent directions x,y, andz, with the hypothesis of an isotropic system. In theory, both Equations (2.1) and (2.2) are equivalent and should lead to the same self-di\u000busion coe\u000ecient value [21]. In practice, it has been shown that the two approaches lead to very similar results for simple systems such as Lennard-Jones uids [1, 22]. However, most authors prefer to use the Einstein relation due to its robustness [23{25] and to some other advantages. Namely, (i) it is not necessary to consider integration limits, (ii) the MSD presents less noise than self-correlation functions, (iii) the coe\u000ecient can be calculated by a simple linear adjustment, and (iv) deviations from linearity can be physically interpreted (e.g. ballistic e\u000bects). In both approaches, the results can be statistically enhanced by using averages calculated over multiple time origins [26].", "It is important to note, however, that MD simulations are not immune to prob- lems and may also present certain limitations that hinder the proper calculation of transport properties. It has been pointed out that the \fnite-size of the simulation box can lead to an underestimation of the calculated self-di\u000busion coe\u000ecient, since long-range hydrodynamic interactions are not properly accounted [7, 27, 28]. In 1993, D unweg and Kremer [29] introduced a correction term for \fnite-size e\u000bects on the calculation of self-di\u000busivity based on the Kirkwood-Riseman theory. The main idea was to determine the hydrodynamic self-interactions by comparing modi\fed Oseen tensors for the case of a \fnite and periodic system and for the case of an in\fnite and nonperiodic system. More than one decade later, Yeh and Hummer [30] showed that disregarded long-range hydrodynamic interactions can lead to underes- timation of the self-di\u000busion coe\u000ecient even for small molecules like water, resulting in a systematic error of about 10% for systems with 2000 water molecules in a peri- odic cubic cell. Then, they derived an analytical correction factor by modeling the hydrodynamics of a particle in a viscous and periodic cubic system, which led to the same correction provided by D unweg and Kremer [29], given by Di;1=Di+\u0010kBT whereDi;1is the self-di\u000busion coe\u000ecient in the thermodynamic limit, Diis the value obtained via MD simulations and either Equation (2.1) or (2.2) (therefore liable to \fnite-size e\u000bects), kbis the Boltzmann constant, Tis the absolute temperature, Lis the cell length, \u0011is the kinematic viscosity, and \u0010\u00192:837297 [31, 32]. Many authors have already discussed about the importance of the \fnite-size e\u000bects on the calculation of self-di\u000busivity and the improvement provided by the Yeh-Hummer correction factor for some varied set of cases, such as Lennard-Jones uids, hard- sphere uids, and systems containing poly(ethylene glycol) dimethyl ethers, pure n-alkanes, water, CO 2, HCO 3{and CO 32{[7, 23, 33{35]. In 2007, an empirical correction factor was proposed for systems with complex density dependence, which converges to the Yeh-Hummer correction factor for most cases [36]. In 2018, Jamali et al. (2018) explored the \fnite-size e\u000bect and calculated self-di\u000busivity of Lennard-Jones uids at di\u000berent system sizes to, in a reverse path, obtain viscosity through the Yeh-Hummer factor with good accuracy and precision [37]. In another recent work, the same author has also proposed a \fnite-size e\u000bect correction for Maxwell-Stefan coe\u000ecients based on the Yeh-Hummer approach [38]. Despite all this, correction factors have been frequently neglected and compensated by the use of large simulation boxes or large cut-o\u000b distances [39], in an unsystematic and unpredictable way. Recently, Gon\u0018 calves et al. (2019) [40] evaluated the e\u000bect of the Lennard-Jones cut-o\u000b radius ( rc) on the calculation of thermodynamic and transport properties, showing that there is great sensitivity in the case of non-polar substances. Therefore, it is essential that the original cut-o\u000b recommendation of each molecular model be respected, since this is also a force-\feld parameter. Another problem is that some force \felds are already parameterized to target transport properties and implicitly bypass the \fnite-size e\u000bects by less appropriate means [41, 42]. In such cases, if due regard is not given to the force \feld, the use of the Yeh-Hummer correction factor may worsen the accuracy of the results compared to experimental data. Some other force \felds may simply overestimate the self-di\u000busion coe\u000ecient under certain conditions [43] (not underestimate, as commonly expected due to \fnite-size e\u000bect), and once again the use of this positive correction factor should make the results apparently less accurate. Most of the commonly used hydrocarbon force \felds, such as the OPLS [44, 45] and GROMOS [46{48] families, as well as NERD [49] and TraPPE [50], are parameterized so as to reproduce thermodynamic and phase equilibrium properties. Generally, a well- calibrated force \feld that reproduces a reasonable set of thermodynamic properties also tends to reproduce transport properties satisfactorily [51], even without the \fnite-size correction factor. Of course, there are several aspects of these force \felds that may, by chance, mask the underestimation caused by the \fnite-size e\u000bect and provide self-di\u000busivity values close to experimental data. The main problem is that, although the \fnite-size e\u000bect does not seem to have much relevance in these cases, the dimensions of the simulation box can still greatly in uence the results. Thus, it seems to be inappropriate to solve an inherent limitation caused by the size of the simulation box by compensating it in other aspects of the force \feld without the proper phenomenological treatment of the problem.", "In this work, we have calculated through MD simulation the self-di\u000busion co- e\u000ecients of several methane/n-hexane mixtures at reservoir conditions, which are relevant systems for the oil-and-gas industry and for gas treatment. We systemati- cally evaluated three di\u000berent united-atom and one all-atom force \felds in terms of self-di\u000busion coe\u000ecients calculated at high pressure conditions. We also investigated the \fnite-size e\u000bects of the simulation box in the calculation of the self-di\u000busivity. We veri\fed the e\u000ecacy of the Yeh-Hummer correction factor at high pressures and the occurrence of issues such as caging e\u000bects and the relation between the dihedral- angle distribution and self-di\u000busivity of molecules, for all tested force \felds in both liquid and supercritical phases. We chose to focus on methane/n-hexane mixtures under several conditions to analyze the \fnite-size e\u000bect and the e\u000eciency of the Yeh- Hummer correction factor under di\u000berent temperatures and pressures. Moreover, by contemplating one light and one intermediate chain hydrocarbon in the range of natural gas, it was also possible to evaluate the composition e\u000bect.", "2.3 Simulation Details", "We have studied several methane(1)/n-hexane(2) mixtures under reservoir con- ditions, with di\u000berent compositions ( x1= 0.27; 0.48; 0.52; 0.72) under pressures of 30, 40 and 50 MPa, and at temperatures of 303.2 and 333.1 K. The simulation boxes were built with the software Playmol [52], and simulations were performed using the LAMMPS package [53]. We evaluated di\u000berent force \felds for the hydro- carbons, namely NERD (united atoms) [49], OPLS (united atoms) [44], OPLS (all atoms) [45], and GROMOS (united atoms) [46, 47] with the quartic bond poten- tial rather than the rigid bonds. All force \felds were used exactly in accordance with their original parameters and recommendations. The parameters of all studied force \felds can be found in Appendix C (C). The size of all systems was \fxed by setting N=1000 molecules placed in a cubic simulation box with periodic boundary conditions. Simulations were performed using a 1 fs timestep and, in the case of the all-atom force \feld, the long-range interactions were calculated by the PPPM method [54], considering an accuracy of 0.0001 for the relative error in forces. Tem- perature and pressure were controlled by the use of Nos\u0013 e-Hoover chain thermostats [55] and the Martyna-Tobias-Klein barostat [56], with their characteristic time scales set to 100 fs and 1000 fs, respectively. The equations of motion were integrated by using the LAMMPS implementation of the method described by Tuckerman et al. Initially, the simulation boxes were built with arbitrary densities. The densities were then equilibrated by performing 7 ns of NpT simulations. New simulation boxes were built with the computed average densities and were subjected to 1 ns equilibration in the canonical ensemble (NVT), followed by a 5 ns production in the same ensemble. All simulations were performed in triplicate to ensure statistical reliability, with the reported mean properties and errors calculated from the results of the three independent simulations. During the data production step, the center- of-mass positions of all molecules in the system were stored at every 200 fs. The stress tensor components \u001cxy,\u001cxzand\u001cyzwere stored at every 10 fs. We calculated the self-di\u000busion coe\u000ecient of each component using the Einstein relation (Equation (2.1)). We also determined the self-di\u000busion coe\u000ecients corrected by the Yeh-Hummer correction factor using Equation (2.3). The kinematic viscos- ity\u0011, which is necessary for determining the Yeh-Hummer correction factor, was calculated by the corresponding Green-Kubo relation kBTZ1 As recently discussed by Kondratyuk (2019), the accuracy and the precision of the viscosity provided by the Green-Kubo method are commonly comparable to the results obtained by non-equilibrum approaches for the case of n-alkanes [58]. We do not take into account the \fnite-size e\u000bects on the viscosity, since this e\u000bect is small and has no clear dependency on the size of the simulation box [7]. To increase the statistical quality of the results, we employed an algorithm of multiple origins in time to determine both the self-di\u000busion coe\u000ecient and the viscosity [26]. For all simulated systems, we compared our results to experimental data by calculating the Absolute Average Deviation (AAD), given by the expression AAD =1 NsNsX s=1jDi\u0000Di;Expj; (2.5) whereNsis the number of samples, Diis the self-di\u000busion coe\u000ecient obtained by Molecular Dynamics simulations, and Di;Exp is its experimental value. We also performed the calculation of the Average Deviation (AD) for groups of samples with the same deviation signal, in order to evaluate the mean deviation signal behavior without taking biased averages by error compensations. The AD is similar to the AAD, but involves the actual value of the di\u000berence between DiandDi;Exp, that is, AD=1 NsNsX", "2.4 Results and Discussions", "2.4.1 Density and viscosity results", "The results of density and viscosity for all mixtures and force \felds are listed in Tables A1-A4 of the Appendix A (A). The obtained density results showed ex- cellent agreement with the values predicted by the GERG-2008 equation of state [59]. Viscosity results also presented good agreement with the predictions of the REFPROP software [60], which calculates viscosity using uid-speci\fc correlations, the ECS method, or the friction theory method.", "According to the estimates of critical coordinates also provided by REFPROP, under the studied conditions all mixtures with methane(1) fractions x1= 0:27, 0:52, and 0:72 are found in the compressible-liquid phase region, while all mixtures with x1= 0:88 are in the supercritical phase region. In general, all the studied systems were in homogeneous phase and in reservoir conditions near the critical transition.", "2.4.2 Self-di\u000busion and \fnite-size e\u000bect", "The self-di\u000busion coe\u000ecients for both components in all mixtures and for all evaluated force \felds are shown in Tables A5-A12 of the Appendix A (A). Figures A1 and A2 also in the Appendix A illustrate the MSD obtained with the OPLS- UA force \feld for methane and n-hexane, respectively, at di\u000berent temperatures, pressures, and compositions. In these \fgures, it is possible to notice the linearity of the mean square displacement at the limit of time tending to in\fnity, according to Einstein's relation (Equation (2.1)). In general, the self-di\u000busion results showed good agreement with experimental data from Helbaek et al. (1998), representing adequately the e\u000bects of temperature, pressure, and composition on self-di\u000busion. Despite the fact that the data production was done in the canonical ensemble (NVT), we observed by simulating some test cases in the microcanonical ensemble (NVE) that the use of Nos\u0013 e-Hoover chain thermostat had no signi\fcant in uence on the molecular di\u000busivities, which has already been reported in the literature [61]. Figures 2.1 and 2.2 illustrate the e\u000bect of the thermodynamic conditions on the self-di\u000busion coe\u000ecients of methane and n-hexane, respectively, by comparing the experimental data to the results obtained using the OPLS-UA force \feld with and without the Yeh-Hummer correction. As the simulated systems are around the critical region, the pressure, composition, and temperature greatly a\u000bect the molecular di\u000busivity. By analyzing the results, one can note that the increase in pressure makes the system denser and reduces the di\u000busivity of the molecules, since at higher densities the system becomes more viscous and the drag forces hinder the molecular di\u000busion. On the other hand, the e\u000bect of the composition is such that the increase in methane(1) concentration decreases the system density, thus enhancing molecular di\u000busion. Finally, as can be seen from the result tables and from Figures A1 and A2 in the Appendix A, as temperature rises the density decreases and molecular di\u000busion is enhanced.", "Figure 2.1: Self-di\u000busion coe\u000ecients of methane(1) in methane(1)/n-hexane(2) mix- tures at 333.1 K, obtained with OPLS-UA Force Field.

Figures 2.3 and 2.4 show how the Yeh-Hummer factor corrects the long- range hydrodynamic interactions and eliminates the dependence on system size for the self-di\u000busivity of both methane(1) and n-hexane(2), with x1= 0.72, at 40 MPa, and 333.1 K. Moreover, the Yeh-Hummer correction factor seems to have solved the problem of \fnite-size e\u000bect regardless of the thermodynamic condition or the force \feld employed. Similar results showing the \fnite-size e\u000bect on self-di\u000busion coe\u000ecients and the impact of the Yeh-Hummer correction factor for pure systems and for other mixtures have already been reported in the literature [7, 30].

Tables 2.1 and 2.2 contain the compiled AAD results for the self-di\u000busion coe\u000ecients of methane and n-hexane, respectively, in the two simulated isotherms. In general, all force \felds showed deviations from the experimental data within an acceptable range. In most cases, the use of the Yeh-Hummer correction brought the self-di\u000busion coe\u000ecients closer to experimental data, reducing the absolute average deviation of the results. However, although it works well on average, there are some cases in which the Yeh-Hummer correction factor moves the results away from the experimental data and increases the AAD when compared to the uncorrected results. Table 2.2 shows that, at T=333.1 K, the use of the Yeh-Hummer correction factor tends to make the self-di\u000busion coe\u000ecients depart from the experimental results. It is worth noting that the uncorrected values are already quite close to the experimental data and the addition of the correction, which is always positive, leads to overestimation.", "Table 2.1: Comparison of the AAD on the isotherms for the self-di\u000busivity of methane(1) without (MD) and with the Yeh-Hummer correction (MD+HY), for di\u000berent force \felds.

It is possible to notice in Figure 2.6(b) that, for high n-hexane di\u000busivities (high temperatures), all force \felds provide highly overestimated coe\u000e- cients after correction, since many values without correction are already above the experimental data. However, it is important to emphasize that the results without correction depend on the size of the simulation box, thus exhibiting an undesirable lack of consistency. The actual results provided by a force \feld should be as close as possible to the thermodynamic limit, which is only achieved by considering the Yeh-Hummer correction factor. Therefore, even when the Yeh-Hummer factor seems to make the results depart from the experimental data, its use is essential to correct the coe\u000ecients and make them consistent, since the force \felds themselves are not capable of completely eliminate the in uence of the \fnite-size e\u000bect on self-di\u000busion.", "In the event that the corrected coe\u000ecients are greatly overestimated when compared to experimental data, it is important to clarify that the poor quality of the results is not a fault of the Yeh-Hummer correction, but of the force \feld itself.

(a) \u0003Molecular Dynamics; (b) Molecular Dynamics with the Yeh-Hummer correction; Solid line (|): perfect agreement with experimental data.", "On average, the GROMOS force \feld along with the Yeh-Hummer factor seemed to be the most accurate choice for the calculation of the self-di\u000busion coe\u000ecients of methane/n-hexane mixtures under the evaluated conditions, since it better ap- proached the experimental data and presented AAD's among the lowest ones for both methane and n-hexane. It should be noted, however, that no force \feld pro- vided spurious or very wrong self-di\u000busion coe\u000ecients under the evaluated high pressure conditions.", "2.4.3 Self-di\u000busion and the e\u000bect of force \felds", "We carried out complementary analysis in order to better understand the dif- ferences in self-di\u000busion coe\u000ecient results provided by di\u000berent force \felds and the reasons why they occur. We noticed that, in most cases, the united-atom force \felds (namely GROMOS, NERD, and OPLS-UA) provided higher self-di\u000busion co- e\u000ecients than the values obtained with the only tested all-atom force \feld (OPLS- AA). Figures 2.7 and 2.8 show the Average Deviation (AD) of the self-di\u000busion coe\u000ecients over all evaluated temperatures and pressures as a function of composi- tion, for all tested force \felds. The AD values were calculated for results with the same deviation behavior, in order to avoid error canceling by adding positive and negative values. It is possible to notice that the all-atom force \feld, on average, un- derestimates the self-di\u000busion further than the united-atom force \felds. This result is expected because all-atom models tend to have less mobility due to the existence of more modes of movement besides translation (more degrees of freedom), whereas the coarse-grained models tend to have higher self-di\u000busive mobility. Figure 2.7 shows, however, that at high methane concentrations an opposite behavior is observed for methane self-di\u000busivity, that is, the all-atom force \feld provided larger self-di\u000busion coe\u000ecients than the united atoms models. This unex- pected result is likely related to the so-called caging e\u000bect, which can occur under certain conditions of high pressures [39]. In general, the caging e\u000bect occurs at high densities because molecules in coarse-grained force \felds tend to become more \\packed\" or \\caged\" by the molecules around them, whereas all-atom molecules gain a greater degree of mobility due to asymmetries and the existence of empty volumes, caused by their non-spherical forms [39, 62]. In our case, it is likely that this counter-intuitive e\u000bect occurs due to the large amount of methane in the system, which is treated as a single sphere in the united atoms force \felds and, therefore, enables a denser packing than it does in the all-atom model, especially at tem- peratures which are not too high. Figure 2.9, which contains radial distribution functions for methane(1)-methane(1) pairs obtained with all models, shows that OPLS-AA seems to generate the pack with the least local density, even for the low- est evaluated methane concentration ( x1= 0.27). By local density we mean the amount of molecules surrounding a certain central molecule, which creates a local uid structure that impairs the self-di\u000busion. Thus, when the system becomes richer in methane ( x1= 0.88), the sparser local packing provided by OPLS-AA is su\u000e- cient to make the methane molecules di\u000buse more rapidly than in the coarse-grained model systems.", "Figure 2.7: Comparison of the Average Deviation (AD) of self-di\u000busivity of methane(1) for di\u000berent force \felds. AD is calculated over three pressures and two temperatures. Dashed lines ( \u0000\u0000): raw molecular dynamics results; Solid lines (|): molecular dynamics results with the Yeh-Hummer correction. As seen thus far, two important aspects that in uence the self-di\u000busivity are the local structure of the uid and the conformation of the molecules. Figures 2.9 to 2.11 show radial distribution functions (RDF) based on the center-of-mass positions of the molecules, aiming at highlighting the di\u000berences in the local structure of these mixtures, with x1= 0.27 at 40 MPa and 303.2 K, resulting from various force \felds. Despite the few di\u000berences observed in Figure 2.9 on the local methane-methane Figure 2.8: Comparison of the Average Deviation (AD) of self-di\u000busivity of n- hexane(2) for di\u000berent force \felds.

We found out that the main reason for this disparity lies in the representation of the n-hexane dihedral potential in each force \feld, which has direct implications in the exibility of the n-alkane chain. In the literature, it has been reported that the exibility of a molecule a\u000bects its self-di\u000busivity, since molecule which are more exible usually tend to undergo smaller drag forces and exhibit faster di\u000busion [63, 64]. Also, according to Feng et al. (2012), under certain conditions the n-alkanes chains may exist in a coiled state, which can slow down the self-di\u000busion process and cause certain force \felds, such as OPLS-UA, to overestimate the self-di\u000busivity by facing di\u000eculty in reproducing the appropriate coiled-chain conformation. Figure 2.9: Radial Distribution Function g11(r) of methane-methane obtained with di\u000berent force \felds, for mixture with x1= 0.27, P = 40 MPa and T = 303.2 K. Figure 2.10: Radial Distribution Function g12(r) of methane-n-hexane obtained with di\u000berent force \felds, for mixture with x1= 0.27, P = 40 MPa and T = 303.2 K. Figure 2.11: Radial Distribution Function g22(r) of n-hexane-n-hexane obtained with di\u000berent force \felds, for mixture with x1= 0.27, P = 40 MPa and T = 303.2 K. Figure 2.12 shows the end-to-end distance distribution of n-hexane in the mixture withx1= 0.27, at 40 MPa and 303.2 K. We did not observe signi\fcant di\u000berences in these pro\fles with variation of the system composition. The GROMOS force \feld presented the most exible and also the most compact n-hexane structure, thus justifying the high local densities observed in Figures 2.10 and 2.11. That is, the smaller end-to-end distance of the GROMOS n-hexane molecules gives rise to a denser packing. Both NERD and OPLS-UA presented a trimodal distribution that reveals more rigid aliphatic chains than those obtained with GROMOS. At the opposite end, the OPLS-AA force \feld seems to present the most rigid n-hexane structure and the least proportional trimodal distribution, with a very large peak near the distance that corresponds to a fully stretched aliphatic chain. This result of OPLS-AA is quite di\u000berent from the others and does not seem to be the most appropriate distribution for n-hexane [65], especially under such temperature and pressure conditions.", "In the literature, GROMOS is reported as a force \feld that adequately repre- sents the dihedral distribution of alkanes, having already undergone corrections to improve the quality of the representations [46] and to correctly predict gauche/trans ratios. This probably contributes to the \fnding that the GROMOS force \feld, when associated with the Yeh-Hummer correction factor, presents good self-di\u000busivity re- Figure 2.12: N-hexane end-to-end distance distribution obtained with di\u000berent force \felds, for mixture with x1= 0.27, P = 40 MPa and T = 303.1 K. sults in comparison to the experimental data. Conversely, there are reports in the literature showing that the OPLS-AA force \feld does not adequately represent the alkane dihedral distributions, leading to the proposal of some corrected force \felds such as L-OPLS-AA [66] and an improved OPLS-AA for peptides and proteins [67]. However, even with a less consistent dihedral distribution, the OPLS-AA force \feld did not produce poor self-di\u000busion results. In this case, it is likely that the param- eterization of OPLS-AA compensates errors and provides results of self-di\u000busion coe\u000ecients with reasonable accuracy despite its poorer representation of molecular conformations.", "2.5 Conclusions", "We performed several simulations of methane/n-hexane mixtures at high pres- sures in order to calculate thermodynamic and transport properties by means of molecular dynamics, with emphasis on self-di\u000busion. In general, the results we ob- tained showed good agreement with experimental data. It has been found that under reservoir conditions the system composition, temperature, and pressure exert a great in uence on self-di\u000busion because most of the simulated systems are relatively close to their critical regions or are already in the supercritical state. The GROMOS force \feld with the Yeh-Hummer correction proved to be the most accurate force \feld for the computation of self-di\u000busion coe\u000ecients for the studied system at high pressures.", "The Yeh-Hummer correction factor, whose purpose is to mitigate the \fnite- size e\u000bects of the simulation boxes in the calculation of the self-di\u000busion coe\u000ecient, presents an excellent consistency in the determination of the self-di\u000busion coe\u000ecient independently of the system size, leading the results closer to the thermodynamic limit. However, eventually the employed force \feld may provide an already over- estimated value of self-di\u000busivity, and thus the addition of the Yeh-Hummer factor may worsen the results with respect to the experimental data. This can happen for several reasons, such as the fact that the force \feld has not been parameterized considering the \fnite-size e\u000bect or the fact that the model does not adequately rep- resent the conformations of the n-alkanes. However, even in these cases, the use of the correction factor is recommended. Unless the simulation is carried out in a very large box, only the corrected self-di\u000busion coe\u000ecient is su\u000eciently size-independent to be considered as the actual result of a force \feld. Our results suggest that an e\u000bort should be made to parameterize force \felds by taking this correction into account.", "We also found out that the choice of a united-atom force \feld can lead to a sort of caging e\u000bect under some circumstances, causing a tendency of producing a slow self-di\u000busion process in comparison to all-atom models. In addition, the choice of the force \feld may also a\u000bect self-di\u000busion due to its ability, or lack thereof, of reproducing the dihedral distribution of a molecule. In this sense, we noticed that the OPLS-AA force \feld presents an end-to-end pro\fle for n-hexane which is far from the expected one, and quite di\u000berent from the outcome of the other tested force \felds. Nevertheless, its self-di\u000busion coe\u000ecient results are not awfully compromised, perhaps due to some compensation of errors imprinted in its whole set of parameters.", "2.6 Chapter References", "[1] WEI-ZHONG, L., CONG, C., JIAN, Y. \\Molecular Dynamics Simulation of Self-Di\u000busion Coe\u000ecient and Its Relation with Temperature Using Simple Lennard-Jones Potential\", Heat Transfer|Asian Research , v. 37, n. 2, [2] HINES, A.

This scenario con\fgures the need for mutual di\u000busion coe\u000ecient data for several systems of scienti\fc and engineering interest, including the oil-and-gas in- dustry, in order to properly describe the phenomenon over a wide range of pressures, temperatures and compositions. In this work, we calculated the Fick di\u000busion coef- \fcients for several CO 2/n-alkane mixtures at high pressures through a new approach derived from modi\fcations on the Fourier Correlation Method (FCM) originally in- troduced by Nichols and Wheeler [I&EC Research, 54, 12156{12164 (2015)]. The FCM results were validated through comparisons with experimental data and with Fick coe\u000ecients calculated through well-established Molecular Dynamics method- ologies. This new approach has some interesting advantages, such as that it provides the Fick coe\u000ecient directly through a single equilibrium calculation, as the thermo- dynamic factor is implicitly considered in the formalism and does not need to be calculated separately. The di\u000busion coe\u000ecients are obtained in the thermodynamic limit condition, since it is shown that the new approach considerably reduces the \fnite-size e\u000bect of the simulation box on their calculation.", "3.2 Introduction", "Mass transfer phenomena are crucial for the development and improvement of technologies in several areas of knowledge, from the biomedical and biotechnology industries to the oil and gas \feld [1]. In the chemical industry, mass transfer pro- cesses are quite recurrent and commonly the mass di\u000busion phenomenon is not only the heart of the operation, but also the limiting step. Therefore, the precise and ap- propriate description of the mutual di\u000busion process is indispensable for industrial equipment and process design [2].", "It is important that mutual di\u000busion be not confused with self-di\u000busion, as they are di\u000berent processes. Self-di\u000busion is an equilibrium phenomenon consisting of molecular di\u000busion due to molecular collisions and Brownian motion, where the net mass ow of each component is zero [3, 4]. On the other hand, ordinary di\u000busion is a non-equilibrium process that manifests itself due to the presence of a chemical potential gradient in the medium, causing a non-zero mass ow of each component and increasing the entropy of the system as it is conducted to the equilibrium [5]. The \frst successful attempt to quantitatively describe the ordinary di\u000busion process was made by Adolf Fick in 1855[6]. As in an analogy to Fourier's thermal conduction law, Fick proposed an equation to the molar ow Jiof a given species i in a binary mixture by stating that this quantity must be directly proportional to the concentration di\u000berence of this species and inversely proportional to the distance corresponding to this di\u000berence [6, 7], that is Ji=\u0000ctDijrxi (3.1) where Ji+Jj= 0,ctis the total molar concentration, rxiis the mole fraction gra- dient of species iin the solvent j, andDijis the proportionality constant known as the binary Fick coe\u000ecient, which is symmetric ( Dij=Dji) and does not depend on the magnitude of the concentration gradient [7]. For the case of a n-component mix- ture, the generalized Fick's law can be applied to determine the ( n\u00001) independent di\u000busion ows [8], according to the equation Ji=\u0000ctn\u00001X j=1Dijrxj (3.2) in whichPn i=1Ji= 0, and the coe\u000ecients Dijare a generalized kind of Fick co- e\u000ecients, since they depend on the de\fnition of the reference velocity frame, do not directly re ect the i-jinteractions anymore, may assume positive and negative values, and are no longer necessarily symmetrical ( Dij6=Dji) [8]. A di\u000berent approach to Fick's for describing mutual di\u000busion in binary diluted gases was \frst proposed by James Maxwell in 1867 [9]. A few years later and independently, Joseph Stefan proposed a generalized form of the Maxwell approach that contemplated the case of uids, consolidating the well-known Maxwell-Stefan (MS) equations [10]. The MS approach considers that di\u000busional ow is the result of the balance between molecular friction forces and thermodynamic interactions [11, 12], correlating the ows directly with the motive force of chemical potential gradient through the equation xi RTrT;P\u0016i=nX j=1j6=i(xiJj\u0000xjJi) ctDij(3.3) whereRis the universal gas constant, Tis the absolute temperature, \u0016iis the chemical potential of component i, andDijis the so-called MS coe\u000ecients. Unlike Fick di\u000busion coe\u000ecients for the multicomponent case, MS coe\u000ecients are indepen- dent of the reference velocity frame, have a more clear physical interpretation, and are always positive and symmetrical ( Dij=Dji). Nevertheless, the MS coe\u000ecients cannot be directly measured by experimental means, since they disconsider the non- ideal e\u000bects of the mixtures and, therefore, are not sensible to deviations of the system from the ideal solution model. This justi\fes the lower dependence of the MS coe\u000ecients on the composition of the mixture [8].", "Although they have di\u000berent constructions, both Fick and MS formalisms de- scribe the same physical phenomenon and must therefore have some equivalence. In a molar reference frame and for a two-component system [13], it is valid that where \u0000 is the so-called thermodynamic factor for a binary mixture, given by i @xi\u0013 in which iis the activity coe\u000ecient of component iin the mixture, and the sub- scriptsT;P;Njindicate that partial di\u000berentiation is carried out at constant tem- perature, pressure, and j-type molecules amount ( j6=i) [14]. It is noteworthy that the thermodynamic factor introduces the non-ideal e\u000bects of the mixture to the MS coe\u000ecient, and for this reason, the Fick coe\u000ecient is commonly more sensitive to the system composition. The generalized form of the correlation between Fick and MS coe\u000ecients for the multicomponent case is given in matrix form and can be found in several mass transfer classical references [8, 15]. It is also worth noting that both Fick and MS coe\u000ecients are implicitly de- pendent on medium composition, temperature and pressure, in a greater or lesser extent. This represents a serious challenge for engineering, as industrial processes take place in very large ranges of temperatures, pressures, and concentrations, and the experimental measurement of the ordinary di\u000busion coe\u000ecients in each scenario of interest would be an extremely arduous and costly task. As some alternatives to the experiments, there are several approaches to estimate mutual di\u000busion coe\u000e- cients, including semi-empirical correlations and the so-called Darken relations [16]. Most of these relations make mutual di\u000busivity a function of composition, tempera- ture, self-di\u000busivity or MS coe\u000ecients at in\fnity dilution, which are easier to obtain experimentally [14]. Another possibility for obtaining ordinary di\u000busion coe\u000ecients for systems of industrial interest is through molecular simulations. Although it is not a practical engineering tool yet, molecular simulations are already widely used for the calculation of mass transport properties, including MS and Fick di\u000busivities In this work, we calculated the Fick di\u000busion coe\u000ecients of several n-alkane/CO 2 mixtures at high pressures using a variation of the methodology proposed by Nichols and Wheeler (2015) [22] called Fourier Correlation Method (FCM). Because this method was initially validated for LJ- uid mixtures, some modi\fcations needed to be made to extend the FCM to the case of molecular systems at high pressures. For purposes of comparison and validation of the FCM, we also compared the obtained results with experimental data and with the di\u000busivities calculated through the tra- ditional approach of Onsager coe\u000ecients for the determination of the MS coe\u000ecients. The MS coe\u000ecients were converted to Fick di\u000busivities through thermodynamic fac- tors also calculated in the Fourier domain, based on the Kirkwood-Bu\u000b formalism. Finally, we were able to evaluate how the simulation box size in uences the Fick coe\u000ecients determined through the FCM, which proved to be practically not subject to the \fnite-size e\u000bects.", "3.3 Theorical Background", "In the context of Molecular Dynamics, there are several systematic ways of cal- culating the ordinary di\u000busion coe\u000ecient. A natural way is to establish a steady and well-de\fned composition gradient in the simulation box and, by determining the mass ow in the box section, calculate the mutual di\u000busion coe\u000ecient. This approach can be achieved by using Reverse Non-Equilibrium Molecular Dynamics methods (R-NEMD), by changing the position and the velocity vectors of molecules in di\u000berent regions of the simulation box to force the occurrence of a constant com- position gradient [19]. Although intuitive, this methodology presents some problems such as the spurious energy drift caused by the R-NEMD algorithms, the high gra- dients uctuations and the fact that the results are still only qualitative [19, 20]. In general, molecular simulations approaches for calculating di\u000busion coe\u000ecients are done through Equilibrium Molecular Dynamics (EMD) methods by analyzing the equilibrium uctuations, which further enables other properties to be calculated in the same simulation. Commonly, approaches via EMD calculate the Maxwell- Stefan coe\u000ecients, which can be converted to the Fick di\u000busion coe\u000ecients by the thermodynamic factor according to Equation (3.4) [21]. One possible way to deter- mine MS di\u000busivities in equilibrium simulations is through the extended Einstein relation for mutual di\u000busion [18], expressed in the form Dij= lim", "6tNiNj", "N wheretis time,Nis the total number of molecules in the system, Niis the number of molecules of component i, andri(t) is the center-of-mass position of component i in unwrapped coordinates, that is, not taking the periodic boundary conditions into account. Another possible approach is to determine the Maxwell-Stefan coe\u000ecients through the well-known Green-Kubo formalism [18, 23, 24], by the relation Dij=NiNj in which viis the center-of-mass velocity of component i. In theory, both Einstein and Green-Kubo formalisms for mutual di\u000busion should lead to the exact same result, although neither approach is usually applied for the computation of the ordinary di\u000busion coe\u000ecient.", "One of the most widely used methodologies for the computation of the MS co- e\u000ecients is based on the Onsager formalism of irreversible thermodynamics [25]. This approach starts from calculation of the n-dimensional matrix of the so-called Onsager coe\u000ecients [17], whose entries \u0003 ijare given by \u0003ij=\u0000lim N* NiX @NjX where the indexes landkrepresent a sum over the center-of-mass position of each molecule of types iandj, respectively. The Onsager reciprocal relations imply that these coe\u000ecients are symmetric (\u0003 ij= \u0003ji). For a binary mixture, the Onsager coe\u000ecients are correlated to the MS difussivities through the relation [14] Dij=xj xi\u0003ii+xi The generalization of the Equation (3.9) for a n-component mixture in matrix no- tation can be found in many references [7, 14, 17]. It is important to point out that the results of all discussed approaches can be statistically re\fned through the use of multiple-origin algorithms for the calculation of correlation functions [26]. Recently, Nichols and Wheeler (2015)[22] proposed a new methodology for the di- rect calculation of Fick di\u000busion coe\u000ecients of binary mixtures through simulations at equilibrium. Based on the Fourier Correlation Method (FCM) applied to Fick's Second Law of di\u000busion, they derived a governing di\u000busion equation that proved to be very useful in Molecular Dynamics simulations and that allows the calculation of Fick coe\u000ecients in the thermodynamic limit condition (therefore, immune to the \fnite-size e\u000bect of the simulation box). They initially de\fned a complex dynamic factor, which can be calculated from the molecules positions over time through the relation NNiX where ^iis the imaginary number and the vector qis the so-called lattice vector in the reciprocal Fourier space, given by L2 my mz3 in whichLis the cubic box size, and the components mx;my;mzare three inde- pendent integers ( m2Z3). Thus, employing Equation (3.10) as an strategy to introduce a \fnite spatial Fourier transform into the Fick's Second Law and turn the problem into a simple ordinary di\u000berential equation (ODE), they showed that [22] whereq=jqj. On the simulation average, Equation (3.12) provides the trivial result of 0 = 0, and for this reason the authors originally chose to turn each side of the equation into an self-correlation function by multiplying them by the complex conjugate of i(q;0), resulting in whereSii(q;t) is the so-called dynamic structure factor, which implicitly contains in- formation about the time evolution of the particle self-correlations, and is expressed by It is noteworthy that, on the average of the simulation, the imaginary term of the dynamic structure factor tends to zero and the property becomes a real quantity. Thus, based on Equation (3.13), the mutual di\u000busion coe\u000ecient for each lattice vector can be determined by a linear regression through the relation \u001eii=1 q2ln\u0014Sii(q;t) and the di\u000busion coe\u000ecient in the thermodynamic limit can be determined by ex- trapolating the results to q!0 (L!1 ).", "In their original work, Nichols and Wheeler (2015) [22] adopted the strategy of averaging the results obtained by choosing each component iandjin Equa- tion (3.15), that is, an average between the results obtained by considering the two self-correlation possibilities Sii(q;t) andSjj(q;t). Besides, they validated this FCM approach for Lennard-Jones binary uids at ordinary temperatures e pressures, as- sociated to an empirical correlation to extrapolate the results to the thermodynamic limit condition. However, as far as we know, there is no extension of this method- ology to compute mutual di\u000busion coe\u000ecients of more complex systems.", "3.4 Methodology Details", "3.4.1 Simulation details", "We have studied several CO 2/n-hexane and CO 2/n-octane mixtures at in\fnity dilution of CO 2under pressures ranging from 1.0 to 68.0 MPa and temperatures of 298 K, 323 K and 373 K.

It is clear that the value of the dynamic structure factor tends on average to zero, as this factor describes the microscopic thermal uctuations of the system that should, according to the hypothesis of Onsager regression, decay to zero over time as well as the macroscopic perturbations in an non-equilibrium condition. Figure 3.6(a) shows the behaviour of the dynamic structure factor at low q-values, where a nonlinear behavior is noted for low periods of time, which rapidly decays and converges to a linear trend for longer times. We believe that this nonlinearity at low time values is a result of the ballistic e\u000bects on di\u000busion, when molecular collisions still play a role and make the proper mutual di\u000busion more di\u000ecult. This e\u000bect is also commonly observed in measurements outside the Fourier domain, as in the case of exponential behavior observed at the beginning of the Mean Square Displacement curve (MSD). For the purpose of linear regression, the initial part of the curve with inertial e\u000bects was disregarded. Nichols and Wheeler (2015)[22] predicted that this behavior should be observed for low q-values in the dynamic structure factor, although they have not e\u000bectively observed the phenomenon in the case of LJ- uid systems. Figure 3.6(b) show the behaviour of the dynamic structure factor for intermediate q-values, where the ballistic e\u000bects at the beginning of the curve is little pronounced and the trend of the data is practically linear as expected. Finally, Figure 3.6(c) illustrates the dynamic structure factor for high q-values, where a nonlinear decay is observed for long periods of time. In this case, the slower decay is observed after a certain characteristic length in which the hydrodynamic interactions promote a relaxation in the system, that causes a logarithmic decay of the dynamic structure factor [51]. Again, as in the case of the structure factor for low q-values, only the linear region was taken into account in the linear adjustment for the computation of the mutual di\u000busion coe\u000ecient corresponding to this lattice vector module. In this work, we used an automatic routine for the linearization of the dynamic structure factor at di\u000berentq-values. This routine considers the peculiarities observed for di\u000berent values of the lattice vector module and ensures that the linear regressions always show a quadratic Pearson correlation coe\u000ecient greater than 0.95 ( R2= 0:95).

The hypothesis that the analytical model based on the Ornstein-Zernike formalism would also be appropriate for the extrapolation of the mutual di\u000busivity seems to be valid, since the adjust to the simulations data was quite satisfactory. It is important to point out that the dispersion of the di\u000busivity values as a function of the q-module can be attenuated by longer simulations, which promotes a data statistical improve- ment. The errors of the Fick coe\u000ecients determined by the FCM were estimated based on the con\fdence interval of the adjusted parameters in the regression model, which ultimately makes this error an indirect measure of the degree of dispersion of theD12(q) data. Although the dispersion on data was clear, the errors propagated to the Fick coe\u000ecient at the thermodynamic limit were low. A pertinent discussion, as highlighted by Nichols and Wheeler (2015)[22], is that one may criticize the FCM due to the need to extrapolate the simulation data, which demands an appropriate model that must be able to describe the Fick di\u000busivities as a function of the q-values. On the other hand, it should be keep in mind that other equilibrium approaches also need to assume an extrapolation to the thermodynamic limit, as in the case of Einstein (Equation (3.6)), Green-Kubo (Equation (3.7)), and Onsager (Equation (3.8)) methodologies. Besides, these approaches do not directly provide the value of the Fick coe\u000ecients, requiring the calculation of the thermodynamic factor. In this sense, the FCM approach not only directly provides the value of the Fick coe\u000ecient but also assumes a extrapolation to q!0, which in some cases may be a clearer task. Moreover, the extrapolation to q!0 would be able to provide Fick di\u000busivities immune to the \fnite-size e\u000bect of the simulation boxes. This e\u000bect is discussed in the following section.", "3.5.3 Finite-size e\u000bect on Fick di\u000busion coe\u000ecients", "In this section, we evaluated the \fnite-size e\u000bect on both approaches employed here to determine the Fick di\u000busion coe\u000ecients.

On the other hand, the Fick di\u000busivity determined through the FCM theoretically present no \fnite-size e\u000bect because the extrapolation to q= 0 is supposed to provide mutual di\u000busion coe\u000ecients at the thermodynamic limit.

Note that the tendency of the Fick di\u000busivity value at the thermodynamic limit is the same for di\u000berent system sizes. However, the dispersion of the data at di\u000berent simulation box sizes cannot be neglected, as these oscillations may cause slightly di\u000berent Fick coe\u000ecient values after the extrapolation process.", "Figure 3.10 directly compares the Fick coe\u000ecients obtained through the two approaches studied in this work, and also includes the Fick coe\u000ecients determined by the traditional methodology and corrected for the \fnite-size e\u000bect according to a recent proposal made by Jamali et al. (2018) [52], which have already been validated in the original work and also in another recent study [53]. The Jamali et al. (2018) [52] strategy basically consists on the use of the Yeh-Hummer factor to correct the \fnite-size e\u000bects on the Fick di\u000busion coe\u000ecients, according to the equation Dij;1=Dij+\u0010kBT whereDij;1is the Fick coe\u000ecient in the thermodynamic limit, Dijis the value ob- tained via EMD simulations by methods liable to \fnite-size e\u000bects, \u0011is the kinematic viscosity, and \u0010\u00192:837297 [54, 55]. We calculated the kinematic viscosity through the well-known Green-Kubo formalism in simulations in triplicate, and the results were statistically improved by using the algorithm of multiple origins. On average, for this CO 2/n-octane mixture with xCO2= 0:2427, at 290.0 K and 1.265 MPa, the viscosity determined by the simulations was \u0011= (3:48\u00060:12)10\u00004Pa\u0001s. The di\u000busivities obtained by the traditional methodology through the Onsager coe\u000ecients seem to be in uenced by the size of the simulation box, which may indi- cate that long-range hydrodynamic interactions not properly accounted in periodic and \fnite systems tends to underestimate the calculated mutual di\u000busivity. How- ever, it should be considered that in some cases the underestimation observed in the Fick coe\u000ecient by the traditional approach appears to be in the same order of magnitude as the uncertainties of the measurements itself. On the other hand, the new FCM seems to considerably reduce the \fnite-size e\u000bect on the calculation of the Fick coe\u000ecients. As expected, the uctuations in D12(q) observed in Figure 3.9 for di\u000berent system sizes were su\u000ecient to provide slightly di\u000berent Fick coe\u000ecients for each case. Because of these uctuations at di\u000berent simulation box sizes, the FCM approach as used in the present work does not seem to provide results completely free of the \fnite-size e\u000bects, although longer simulations and greater accuracy in determining the linear region of the dynamic structure factor should reduce these uctuations and make the Fick coe\u000ecients even less dependent on the simulation box size.", "In general, it is noted that the Jamali et al. (2018) [52] correction greatly atten- uates the e\u000bect of \fnite-size, although the problem does not seem to be completely solved since the slope of its adjusted line is not exactly zero. Thus, it is possible to state that the e\u000eciency of the FCM in mitigating the \fnite-size e\u000bect on the calculation of the Fick coe\u000ecients is comparable to the e\u000eciency provided by the correction factor as proposed by Jamali et al.

The proposed modi\fcation on the dynamic structure factor regression equation for the Fick di\u000busion calculation was not only physically more consistent, but also provided consistent results. In addition, the hypothesis of the validity of the analytical model based on the Ornstein- Zernike formalism and on the LJ long-range correction in the Fourier domain for the regression of D12(q) data proved to be valid.", "We evaluated the \fnite-size e\u000bect on the Fick coe\u000ecient obtained via molecu- lar simulations. The well-established methodology that employs the Maxwell-Stefan (MS) coe\u000ecients converted to Fick di\u000busivities by the thermodynamic factor seemed to be subject to the \fnite-size e\u000bect. In contrast, the new approach by FCM pre- sented practically no \fnite-size issues, which may only be manifested due to the dispersion of the D12(q) values that ultimately in uences the data regression pro- cess. In general, the small \fnite-size e\u000bect observed in the results obtained by the FCM is comparable to that observed in the Fick coe\u000ecients after the employment of the correction factor as proposed by Jamali et al. (2018) [52]. In summary, the extended FCM has proved to be a very promising approach for calculating Fick di\u000busion coe\u000ecients in binary systems. Among the main ad- vantages, we highlight the fact that the thermodynamic factor is already implicitly embedded in the calculation and the already mentioned minimization of the \fnite- size e\u000bect on the coe\u000ecient determination. On the other hand, issues concerning the extrapolation process represent an inherent di\u000eculty of the method. Finally, although it is not the main purpose of the this work, we were able to successfully calculate the thermodynamic factor through the static structure factor in the Fourier Domain. Again, the proposed analytical model proved to be quite e\u000bective for extrapolating the results for the thermodynamic limit. In addition, this approach has been shown to be virtually immune to the \fnite-size e\u000bect of the simulation box, which is a problem commonly observed in Kirkwood-Bu\u000b integrals resolution.", "3.7 Chapter References", "[1] VELLA, J.

In the \frst part of the thesis, we showed that self-di\u000busivity is greatly in uenced by the \fnite-size e\u000bect of the simulation box, and that special attention should be paid not only to the use of the Yeh-Hummer correction factor, but also to the employed force \feld. Among the main contributions of this \frst work, we can highlight: •A systematic analysis of di\u000berent force \felds for the calculation of self-di\u000busion coe\u000ecients of n-alkanes through Molecular Dynamics simulations at high pres- sures, in both liquid and supercritical phases; •An evaluation and discussion on the accuracy of the Yeh-Hummer correction factor to mitigate \fnite-size e\u000bects using di\u000berent force \felds, clarifying that its use makes the results more consistent but not necessarily closer to the experimental data; •A reporting that, at high pressures, the conformation of the n-alkane chain and the caging e\u000bect can have great in uence on self-di\u000busion.", "In the second part of the thesis, we introduced a new approach for the calculation of the Fick di\u000busion coe\u000ecients through modi\fcations in the so-called Fourier Corre- lation Method. This new strategy has provided consistent results and was validated by experimental data and by Fick di\u000busivities determined through other traditional molecular dynamics methodologies. Besides, the new proposed methodology pre- sented some advantages, such as the di\u000busivity calculation by a single equilibrium calculation in the Fourier domain and the fact that this approach is considerably less susceptible to the \fnite-size e\u000bect. Among the main contributions to the literature of this part of the thesis, we can list:", "•A new and promising approach for calculating Fick di\u000busion coe\u000ecients in the thermodynamic limit condition by a single calculation in equilibrium Molecular Dynamics simulations; •The use of an analytical equation for the extrapolation of the structure factor values for the calculation of the thermodynamic factor of molecular systems under high pressures, based on the Ornstein-Zernike theory. •An evaluation of the \fnite-size e\u000bect on the Fick coe\u000ecients determined by the new FCM approach and by the traditional methods in Molecular Dynam- ics through the Maxwell-Stefan coe\u000ecients associated to the thermodynamic factor.", "4.2 Future Works", "In future works, we intend to evaluate the performance of several force \felds and of the Yeh-Hummer correction for the computation of self-di\u000busivity in hydrocarbon/CO 2mixtures at reservoir conditions, combining di\u000berent models avail- able in the literature for carbon dioxide with force \felds commonly used for hydro- carbons. In the case of mutual di\u000busion coe\u000ecients, we plan to extend the FCM to multicomponent mixtures through the Maxwell-Stefan formalism in the Fourier domain. Thus, it would be possible to determine mutual di\u000busivities considerably reducing the \fnite-size e\u000bects for more complex mixtures. In time, we still intend to further explore the possibilities of determining the static structure factor under the thermodynamic limit condition, since from this we can determine the Kirkwood-Bu\u000b coe\u000ecients and, therefore, a series of relevant thermodynamic properties can be cal- culated. Finally, we also plan to study the \fnite-size e\u000bect on the determination of the thermodi\u000busion coe\u000ecients via non-equilibrium molecular simulations, a point not yet systematically explored and that is still unknown in the literature.

These equations ares based on the work of Nichols and Wheeler (2015)[ ?]. Here we present more details of solving the equations and introduce a modi\fcation in their original formalism to take into account the cross correlation function between the components iandjof the mixture in the governing di\u000busion equation.", "The demonstration of the Fourier Correlation Method begins from the so-called Fick's Second Law of di\u000busion, given by @ci(r;t) @t=Dijr2ci(r;t) (S1) where the Fick coe\u000ecient Dijis assumed to be position independent, which is fun- damental to allow the use of the Fourier method. Applying the Fourier transform on both sides of Equation (S1), we obtain F\u001a@ci(r;t) =DijF\b r2ci(r;t) At this point, it is more convenient to introduce a discrete Fourier transform of the concentration term, replacing the continuous integration of the continuous Fourier transformation by the sum over the molecules in the system. Therefore Ffci(r;t)g= ^ci(q;t) =1 NiNiX l=1ci(r;t)e\u0000^iq\u0001rl;i(t) NiNi VNiX VNiX Multiplying the Equation (S3) by the inverse of the total concentration, c\u00001 t=V N, we can de\fne a new quantity i(q;t) that is related to the discrete Fourier transform of the species iconcentration through the equation i(q;t) =V NNiX Ffci(r;t)g=N Besides, an important property of the Fourier transforms allows us perform the transformation of the concentration laplacian term in Equation (S2). Thus, consid- ering the Equation (S4), we obtain that F\b r2ci(r;t) c2 i(r;t) F\b r2ci(r;t) Lastly, the discrete Fourier transform of the partial derivative of the species icon- centration over time can be written as follows F\u001a@ci(r;t) @tFfci(r;t)g=N V@ Substituting Equations (S5) and (S6) into Equation (S2), we transform the origi- nal partial di\u000berential equation (PDE) into a simple ordinary di\u000berential equation (ODE), according to N V@ @t[ i(q;t)] =\u0000q2DijN V i(q;t) The solution of Equation (S7) is ln i(q;t) =\u0000q2Dijt+constant , in which the constant may assume di\u000berent values for di\u000berent lattice vectors q. Therefore, the general solution of Equation (S7) is given by As previously discussed, Nichols and Wheeler (2015)[ ?] reported that, over the simulation average, the Equation (S8) results the trivial solution 0 = 0. For this reason, they decided to multiply both sides of Equation (S8) by the complex conju- gate of i(q;0), turning them into two self-correlation functions. Here, however, we decided to multiply both sides of Equation (S8) by the complex conjugate j(\u0000q;0) and introduce two cross-correlation function between components iandj, which is physically more consistent with the problem of determining the mutual di\u000busion coe\u000ecient. Therefore, we have that from which we can take averages over the simulation and simplify the notation by Sij(q;t) =Sij(q;0)e\u0000Dij(q)q2t(S9) where Finally, by rewriting Equation (S9), we obtain the governing di\u000busion equation of the modi\fed Fourier Correlation Method, as given by \u001eij=1 q2ln\u0014Sij(q;t) Supplementary Graphics and Tables Figure S1: Results of the Onsager coe\u000ecients (a) \u0003 11, (b) \u0003 12, and (c) \u0003 22for CO 2/n-hexane mixtures at in\fnity dilution of CO 2, at 290.0 K and under di\u000berent pressures.

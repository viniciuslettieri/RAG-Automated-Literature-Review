Microorganisms able to grow using petroleum hydrocarbons as a sole source of carbon and energy are considered as important biotechnologica l tools for the remediation of environments contaminated with petroleum hydrocarbons . These microorganisms generally present oxygenases that are essential for the degradation of aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons. However , the presence and also the distri bution of petroleum hydrocarbon -degrading microorganisms in extreme environments, such as Antarctic soils, were still poorly understood .", "In this study , the presence, the distribution and the structure of aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbon -degrading bacterial communities in contaminated and uncontaminated soils from King George Island, Antarctic a, were described . To access these specific communities, g enes coding for oxygenases associated with the degradation of aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons were used as biomarker s for molecular analyses , such as PCR (polymerase chain reaction) , DGGE (denaturing gel gradient electrophoresis), RFLP (restriction fragment length polymorphism) and clone libraries.", "Using the alkane -monooxygenase gene as a target, PCR -DGGE results , showed that even in uncontaminated soils from King George Island high diverse bacterial communities able to degrad e aliphatic hydrocarbons were found . On the other hand, the presence of genes related to bacterial polycyclic hydrocarbon (PAH) degradation was predominantly detected in soils previously contaminated with these hydrocarbons. Clone library analyses of genes coding for dioxygenases related to PAH degradation showed the presence of dioxygenases previously described in Pseudomonas , Burkholderia , Acidovorax , Polaromonas , Sphingomonas , Mycobacterium , Rhodococcus and Brevibacillus . To our knowledge, this was the first time that the catabolic potentia l to degrade PAH in Gram -positive bacteria was described in Antarctic soils.", "Finally , the results obtained also showed that hydrocarbon -degrading bacterial communities are influenced by the chemical and physico -chemical proprieties of King George Island soils, such as the concentration of hydrocarbons in contaminated soils and the pH.

INTRODUÇÃO", "1.1 O petróleo", "O petróleo é considerado a mistura mais complexa de compostos orgânicos já encontrada na Terra ( HEAD, JONES & RÖLING , 2006). Essa complexidade é resultado de uma mistura de hidrocarbonetos e de compostos orgânicos como asfaltenos (fenóis, ácidos graxos, cetonas, ésteres e porfirinas) e resinas (piridinas, quinolinas, carbazoles, sulfóxidos e amidos) que são encontrados no petróleo ( ROJO, 2009 ). Entretanto, nos fluídos petrolíferos, os hidrocarbonetos são os constituintes mais impo rtantes e presentes em maior quantidade. As principais famílias químicas dos hidrocarbonetos são os alcanos (hidrocarbonetos de cadeia aberta), os cicloalcanos (os quais incluem todos os hidrocarbonetos cujos átomos estão arranjados em forma de anel) e os hidrocarbonetos aromáticos (caracterizados pela presença de ao menos um anel de benzeno) (PLANCKAERT , 2005 ).", "O petróleo , também conhecido como ouro negro, representa a maior fonte de energia consumida pelas indústrias ( LEUNG et al., 2007), abastecendo 39 % da energia mundial. Como qualquer processo em escala industrial, a produção de petróleo pode causar a contaminação de ambientes marinhos e terrestres ( WHITE et al ., 2006). Impactos ambientais relacionados às atividades da indústria petrolífera podem ocor rer durante praticamente todas as etapas existentes entre a produção e o uso dos derivados petrolíferos, e são considerados um dos principais problemas para o meio ambiente (WEI, MATHER & FOTHERINGHAM, 2005).", "1.2 Contaminação de solos antárticos por hidrocarbonetos do petróleo Ambientes extremos, como as regiões polares do Ártico e da Antártica, possuem um papel importante na manutenção da vida no planeta. As baixas temperaturas características dessas regiões conferem a esses ambientes um papel na reg ulação do clima no planeta, influenciando o nível dos oceanos, equilibrando os ciclos sazonais e tornando as condições de temperatura viáveis para a manutenção da vida no planeta Terra. Entretanto, o Ártico e a Antártica, embora apresentem características climáticas muito semelhantes, possuem aspectos geográficos distintos ( AISLABIE & FOGHT, 2010 ). Enquanto o Ártico é uma calota de mar congelado cercado de continentes, a Antárt ica é um continente cercado por oceano s. A evolução do continente antártico foi influenciada pelo isolamento geográfico, que ocorreu há cerca de 33,7 milhões de anos, e também pelas baixas temperaturas ( CLARKE, BARNES & HODGSON, 2005 ). Na Antártica, a exploração territorial através de centros de monitoramento e pesquisa científica, bem como a exploração através do turismo, pode acarretar em graves acidentes ambientais. A principal fonte de energia utilizada em estações de pesquisa na Antártica, também utilizada para o transporte terrestre , é proveniente de derivados petrolíferos, como o diesel ártico - DFA ( Diesel Fuel Arctic ). Esse combustível é constituído principalmente por hidrocarbonetos alifáticos saturados (64%) e por hidrocarbonetos aromáticos (35%), incluindo os hidrocarbonetos poliaromáticos (HPA) (YERGEAU et al., 2009).", "Exemplos de vazamentos de D FA em solos antárticos são comu mente relatados. Áreas próximas a estações de pesquisa científica, onde é comum o estoque de combustível em tanques de armazenamento, representam um grande risco para acidentes ambientais (AISLABIE et al. , 2004) . Por exemplo, diferentes estudos mostraram que áreas próximas à antiga estação brasileira de pesquisa na Antártica, Estação Comandante Ferraz, apresentavam concentrações elevadas de hidrocarbonetos provenientes de derivados do petróleo (WHYTE et al., 2002 ; LUZ et al., 2006 ). Esse quadro é também obse rvado em solos próximos de diferentes estações de pesquisa s na Antártica ( AISLABIE & FOGHT, 2010; PANICKER et al., 2010; POWELL et", "1.3 Biorremediação de hidrocarbonetos do petróleo", "Altas concentrações de hidrocarbonetos do petróleo no ambiente, proveniente s de contaminações ambientais por derivados petrolíferos ou mesmo pelo óleo cru, são tóxicas para a maioria das formas de vida (PHILP et al ., 2005a). Entretanto, muitos microrganism os possuem a capacidade de oxidar, imobilizar, volatilizar e, também, de transformar hidrocarbonetos em compostos não tóxicos (STROUD , PATON & SEMPLE, 2007) . Desde a década de 80, essa capacidade microbiana em degradar poluentes orgânicos atrai muito interesse como tecnologia de remediação de ambientes contaminados com petróleo e seus derivados (YAKIMOV, TIMMIS & GO LYSHIN, 2007) . Chamada de biorremediação, essa tecnologia possui aplicação mais simples, barata e com menores impactos ambientais do que os gerados pelas tecnologias baseadas em processos físico -químicos (opções não biológicas) (LOVLEY , 2003 ). Os processos físico -químicos , além de laboriosos , muitas vezes possuem custos proibitivos para aplicação e não levam à remoção completa dos contaminant es (LOVLEY & LLOYD, 2000). Na biorremediação, a degradação microbiana completa de hidrocarbonetos do petróleo (mineralização) resulta em compostos nãotóxicos , como o dióxido de carbono e a água , e também em biomassa celular (principalmente proteínas) que p ode ser assimilada na cadeia alimentar ( ATLAS & HAZEN , 2011 ).", "Ao longo dos anos de pesquisa na área de biorremediação , diferentes estratégias foram elaboradas para aumentar ou aperfeiçoar a eficiência dess a técnica . Em geral , a escolha do método mais eficiente de biorremediação leva em consideração as características dos contaminantes (ex: susceptibilidade ao ataque microbiano), a característica do local contaminado (ex: tipo de solo e clima, geologia e hidrologia) e o processo microbiano a ser utiliza do (ex: presença da comunidade microbiana de interesse alóctone ou uso de bactérias previamente cultivadas em laboratório ) (BENTO et al., 2005 ; ALVAREZ et al., 2011 ).", "Na biorremediação , a ausência do potencial catabólico microbiano em um determinado ambiente contaminado pode ser suprid a pela adição, nesse mesmo ambiente, de uma ou mais estirpe s bacterianas ou fúngicas previamente isolada (s) e cultivada (s) em laboratório que possua (m) as características de degradação desejada . Esse processo é conhecido como bioaumento (SCOW & HICKS, 2005; ALVAREZ et al., 2011; MARQUES et al ., 2011). Outro fator muito utilizado para acelerar a taxa de degradação de contaminantes através da biorremediação é o bioestímulo, onde doadores de elétrons, água e nutrientes como o nitrogênio, fósforo, potássio, entre outros, são adicionados no ambiente para fomentar o crescimento e acelerar o metabolismo microbiano ( SALINA -MARTÍNEZ et al., 2008 , ALVAREZ et al., 2011). Considerando o bioestímulo, alguns fatores relacionados à estrutura da comunidade microbiana de interesse são importantes para atingir o efeito desejado de se aumentar o metabolismo microbiano . Por exemplo, se duas populações bacterianas degradadoras de um determinado poluente ambiental forem semelhantes filogenetic amente , essas bactérias poderão responder a um dado estímulo também de modo semelhante , independentemente do ambiente onde são encontradas . Ao contrário, bactérias degradadoras com características diferentes poderão responder de maneiras distintas ao mesmo estímulo. Nesse caso, para a aplicação efetiva do bioestímulo , a padronização da concentração dos nutrientes é necessária em cada situação de estudo (SALINA -MARTÍNEZ et al., 2008 , ALVAREZ et al., 2011).", "1.4 Microrganismos degradadores de hidroc arbonetos", "Microrganismos degradadores de hidrocarbonetos do petróleo já foram encontrados em todos os locais pesquisados, incluindo ambientes extremos como a Antártica e o Ártico ( VAN HAMME, SINGH & W ARD , 2003; KUHN, BELLICANTA & PELLIZARI, 2009). A capacidade de utilizar hidrocarbonetos do petróleo como fonte de carbono e de energia não está restrita a um grupo particular de microrganismos. Bactérias, fungos e até algumas algas aclorofiladas podem crescer utilizando esses compostos como fonte de carb ono ( VAN BEILEN & WITHOLT , 2005). Somente entre as bactérias, mais de 75 gêneros já foram descritos possuindo espécies capazes de utilizar hidrocarbonetos como fonte de carbono e energia . Alguns exemplos importantes são espécies dos gêneros Pseudomonas, Rh odococcus , Dietzia , Gordonia e Sphingomonas (WANG et al., 2010 ). A lista de hidrocarbonetos que podem ser utilizados por esses microrganismos é grande e inclui alcanos saturados e ramificados, alcenos, compostos alicíclicos e heterocíclicos, e hidrocarbone tos aromáticos. Entretanto, alguns hidrocarbonetos mais recalcitrantes não são degradados ou são degradados somente parcialmente pelos microrganismos (RATLEDGE, 1984).", "1.5 Degradação de hidrocarbonetos do petróleo: a importância das oxigenases microbianas As oxigenases são enzimas que incorporam um ou dois átomos de oxigênio molecular (O 2) em seus substratos ( HARAYAMA, KOK & NEID LE, 1992; HAYAISHI, 2004). As oxigenases pertencem a uma ampla classe de enzimas que possuem um papel importante e fun ções críticas e específicas no metabolismo de compostos endógenos e de compostos exógenos em todas as formas aeróbias de vida (HAYAISHI, 2008). São, por exemplo, importantes para a biossíntese e degradação de hormônios, vitaminas, aminoácidos, açúcares e l ipídios, e também no descarte metabólico de compostos adventícios, como drogas, toxinas, xenobiontes, compostos carcinogênicos, entre outros (HAYAISHI, 2005).", "Na degradação de hidrocarbonetos do petróleo pelos microrganismos , essas enzimas são as responsá veis por iniciar a degradação de hidrocarbonetos aromáticos através da hidroxilação do anel aromático, diminuindo a estabilidade da molécula e levando a quebra subsequente do anel ( HARAYAMA, KOK & NEID LE, 1992). Também são as responsáveis por catalisar as reações iniciais da degradação de hidrocarbonetos alifáticos, ativando esses compostos que são considerados quimicamente inertes As oxigenases que catalisam a incorporação de apenas um átomo de oxigênio molecular (O 2) em seus substratos (S) s ão chamadas de monoxigenases (HAYAISHI, 2004). Nas reações catalisadas por este tipo de enzima, o segundo átomo do dioxigênio é reduzido a H 2O tanto pelo próprio substrato ou por um co -substrato reduzível (H 2X): SH2 + O 2 = SO + H 2O S + O 2 + H 2X = SO + H 2O + X As oxigenases que catalisam a incorporação dos dois átomos de oxigênio molecular (O 2) em seus substratos são chamadas de dioxigenases (HAYAISHI, 2004). Na degradação de hidrocarbonetos do petróleo, dois tipos de dioxigenases são conhecidos: (i) diox igenase específica para anel aromático e (ii) dioxigenase com subsequente quebra do anel aromático. A dioxigenase específica para anel aromático incorpora dois grupos hidroxil no anel aromático com o consumo de O 2 e de NAD(P)H, conforme a reação abaixo:", "A dioxigenase com subsequente quebra do anel aromático abre o anel incorporando dois átomos do O 2 em seus substratos:", "1.5.1 Oxigenases relacionadas à ativação de alcanos", "Os a lcanos são hidrocarbonetos alifáticos saturados que representam os principais constituintes do petróleo e dos derivados petrolíferos após o refino. Esses compostos, que podem ser lineares (n -alcanos), cíclicos (ciclo -alcanos) ou ramificados (iso-alcanos), foram formados pela redução de materiais orgânicos durante a formação geoquímica do petróleo ( KLOOS, MUNCH & SCHLO TER, 2006).", "O mecanismo mais estudado da oxidação microbiana de n -alcanos envolve o “ataque” de uma oxigenase em um dos grupos metil terminal da molécula, o que gera um alcanol, em seguida um alcanal e depois um ácido graxo (ROJO , 2005). Entretanto, a oxidação de grupos subterminais também pode ocorrer. Nesse caso, podem ser produzidos cetonas e o álcool secundário correspondente. A degradação subsequente + NAD+ + O2+ NADH + H+ + O2(quebra intradiol ) (quebra extradiol ) dessas cetonas ocorre via introdução de oxigênio na cadeia, gerando um éter correspondente que é hidrolisado para gerar um álcool com 2 átomos de carbono a menos que o alcano original (RATLEDGE, 1984).", "Os ácidos graxos produzidos nas duas vias descritas podem ser oxidados por: (a) β-oxidação para gerar várias molécula s de acil -CoA; (b) α -oxidação, onde o acil - CoAester é convertido a um homólogo menor com a perda de CO 2; e (c) pela oxidação da outra extremidade da molécula. No último caso (c), podem ser gerados ω -ácido graxo e ω -hidroxiácido graxo (RATLEDGE, 1984).", "Na maioria dos organismos, a oxidação inicial de alcanos é catalisada por um sistema de hidroxilase complexo, onde as alcano oxigenases estão sempre ligadas a sistemas de carreadores de elétrons. Em procariotos, o complexo da alcano hidroxilase de Pseudomonas putida GPo1 (sistema AlkB) é o mais conhecido e melhor estudado. Esse complexo consiste principalmente de uma hidroxilase transmembrana (a monoxigenase chamada de AlkB) e de duas proteínas solúveis (chamadas de rubredoxina - AlkG e rubredoxina redutase - AlkT). A rubredoxina redutase transfere elétrons do cofator NADH para a rubredoxina e esse elétron é transferido para a enzima AlkB; esta última catalisa a oxidação do alcano com u m átomo de oxigênio derivado de uma molécula de oxigênio molecular (O 2), transformando o alcano em um álcool, sendo a segunda molécula de oxigênio reduzida a H 2O através dos elétrons transferidos do NADH pelas enzimas AlkG e AlkT ( Figura 1) (ROJO , 2009 ). Este álcool é oxidado até ácido tricarboxílico (TCA) ( VAN HAMME, SINGH & WARD, 2003).", "Resumo da reação: R -CH 3 + NADH + O 2 → R-CH 2OH + NAD+ + H 2O zR-CH3 R-CH2 OH Rubredoxina Fe2+ Rubredoxina Fe3+Redutase (FAD) Redutase (FADH2)NADH NAD+O2 H2O", "Em P. putida GPo1, onde o “sistema AlkB” foi mais estudado, os genes que codificam essa via estão agrupados em dois operons: alkBFGHJKL e alkST . Esses estão localizados no plasmídio OCT a 9 Kb de distância um do outro ( KOK et al. , 1989; VAN BEILEN, WUBBOLTS & WITHOLT , 1994). Genes homólogos ao sistema alcano hidroxilase de P. putida GPo1 foram encontrados em diversas bactérias pertencentes às classes Alpha , Beta e Gamaproteobacteria , e em bactérias da ordem Actinomicetales (COLE et al. ,1998; RATAJCZAK, GEIΒDÖRFE R & HILLE N, 1998; SMITS et al. , 1999; VAN BEILEN & FUNHOFF, 2007 ; FENG et al., 2007; WANG et al., 2010 ). Entretanto, as comparações realizadas entre as sequências nucleotídicas de alcano hidroxilases alkB de diversas bactérias Gram -negativas e Gram -positivas mostram baixas identidades entre as mesmas . Isso foi observado principalmente em estirpes dos gêneros Pseudomonas , Rhodococcus e Acinetobacter (SMITS et al ., 2002; WANG, WANG & SHAO, 2010 ), onde sequências de aminoácidos correspondentes a AlkB diferentes apresenta vam algumas vezes apenas 40% de identidade ( VAN BEILEN et al., 2003 ).", "1.5.2 Oxigenases relacionadas à utilização de hidrocarbonetos poliaromáticos (HPA) Hidrocarbonetos poliaromáticos (HPA), como naftaleno, fenantreno, antraceno, entre outros, são compostos orgânicos naturais gerados continuamente pela combustão incompleta da matéria orgânica ( JACQUES, BENTO & CAM ARGO , 2007). Entretanto, estes compostos também são componentes das frações pesadas do petróleo, e são liberados em grande quantidade no ambiente através de acidentes ambientais e através da combustão de combustíveis fósseis em baixa concentração de oxigênio ( AKHMETOV Muitos microrganismos desenvolveram vias bioquímicas complexas para transformar HPA em intermediários co muns do seu catabolismo ( JACQUES, BENTO & CAMARGO , 2007). Uma comparação geral das principais vias de degradação de HPAs em bactérias revelou que as etapas iniciais de conversão são realiza das por enzimas diferentes, mas que os compostos são transformados em um número limitado de intermediários (CHAUDRY & CHAPALAMADUGU, 1991). Em geral, na utilização destes compostos pelos microrganismos, o anel aromático do hidrocarboneto é hidroxilado por dioxigenases gerando levando a formação de diols. Os anéis são, en tão, clivados até a formação de catecol ou gentisato, o qual é subsequentemente degradado em intermediários do ciclo do ácido tricarboxílico (TCA) ( ATLAS , 1995; HABE & OMORI, O sistema de degradação do naftaleno é, comumente, utilizado como modelo de degradação de HPAs. No metabolismo aeróbio bacteriano do naftaleno ( Figura 2), o “ataque” inicial é realizado por um complexo enzimático dioxigenase que adiciona dois átomos de oxigênio no anel aromático, quebrando a estabilidade do composto. O produto desta reação é um cis -diidrodiol, que por ação de uma desidrogenase é transform ado em um composto diidroxilado. Oxidações subsequentes permitem a abertura de um dos anéis aromáticos, gerando salicilaldeído e a formação de ácido pirúvico, que será utilizado como fonte de carbono e energia pela célula. Uma desidrogenase, então, catalis a a conversão do salicilaldeído a ácido salicílico. Esse último é subsequentemente metabolizado a compostos intermediários do ciclo do ácido tricarboxílico através das vias metabólicas do catecol ou do gentisato ( GOYAL & ZYLSTRA, 1996; HABE & OMORI, 2003; JACQUES, BENTO & CAM ARGO, 2007 ). As dioxigenases de HPAs pertencem a uma grande família de enzimas conhecida como dioxigenases de hidroxilação de anéis aromáticos (GIBSON & PARALES, 2000). Todos os membros dessa família possuem uma ou duas proteínas trans portadoras de elétrons precedendo a ação da dioxigenase, que em conjunto formam uma cadeia curta de transporte de elétrons ( CERNIGLIA , 1992), como exemplificado na Figura 3 . Genes que codificam dioxigenases de hidroxilação de anéis aromáticos foram descri tos em diferentes bactérias Gram -negativas e Gram -positivas. Em Pseudomonas putida PpG7, onde a via de degradação de HPAs foi melhor descrita, o plasmídeo NAH7 carreia dois operons relacionados com a degradação de naftaleno: o operon nah, que codifica as e nzimas responsáveis pelos estágios iniciais do metabolismo do naftaleno (de naftaleno até ácido salicílico) e o operon sal, que codifica as enzimas responsáveis pela transformação de ácido salicílico a catecol (PHILP et al ., 2005a). Ainda em espécies de Pseudomonas , outros genes de degradação de HPAs foram caracterizados, como os genes dox em Pseudomonas sp. C18, pah em P. putida OUS82 e os genes nod em P. putida NCIB 9816. Entretanto, esses genes são conhecidos também como “genes clássicos parecidos com nah” pois, em todos esses operons, os genes que codificam as enzimas que catalisam a parte inicial da degradação de HPAs possuem uma alta identidade e uma organização gênica parecida com a do operon nah (HABE &", "BENTO & CAMARGO , 2007).", "(CERNIGLIA , 1992).", "Genes do catabolismo de HPA com características evolutivas diferentes dos genes nah de Pseudomonas foram caracterizados em outras bactérias Gram -negativas, como os genes phd em Comamonas testosteroni GZ39, os genes nag em Ralstonia sp. U2 e os genes phn em Burkholderia sp. RP007 (GOYAL & ZYLSTRA, 1996; LAURIE & LLOYD -JONES, 1999; ZHOU, FUENMAYOR & WILLIAMS, 2001; HABE & OMORI, As v ias do catabolismo de HPA de bactérias Gram -positivas foram menos estudadas do que as de bactérias Gram -negativas. Entretanto, genes envolvidos na via de degradação de HPA foram descritos principa lmente em bactérias do grupo dos actinomicetos, onde os genes nar, phd e nid já foram caracterizados em Rhodococcus sp. NCIMB12038, Nocardioides sp. KP7 e Mycobacterium vanbaalenii PYR-1, respectivamente (LARKIN et al., 1999; SAITO, IWABUCHI & HARAYAMA, 19 99; KHAN et al., 2001). Em geral, as dioxigenases codificadas por esses genes possuem baixas identidades com outras dioxigenases de anel aromático. Por exemplo, quando descoberta, a dioxigenase codificada pelo gene narA de Rhodococcus sp. NCIMB12038 aprese ntou apenas 31 -39% de identidade com outras dioxigenases de hidroxilação de anel aromático (LARKIN et al ., 1999). Em 2006, Kim e colaboradores clonaram e caracterizaram mais um gene de dioxigenase envolvida na degradação de HPAs por Mycobacterium vanbaalen ii PYR-1, chamado de nidA3B3 . Esse gene possui uma maior identidade com o gene phd de Nocardioides sp.

Nesses casos , o biomonitoramento é realizado através da avaliação da presença, ausência ou abundância de um indicador biológico (biomarca dor) que pode ser espécies, populações ou comunidades de organismos vivos específicos que respondam d e maneira ordenada a uma alteração ambiental ( PEREIRA et al., 2006 ). Dentre os biomarcadores ambientais mais utilizados , os microrganimos se destacam por serem os primeiros a responder a alterações nos padrões físico -químicos de um determinado ambiente, além de serem de fácil cultivo e de rápida multiplicação, o que facilita o seu monitoramento (FURLEY & CARVALHO, 2000) .", "Embora a análise de biomonitoramento ambiental seja muitas vezes realizada através de métodos dependentes de cultivo de microrganismos, somente 1 a 10% da diversidade de microrganismos é conhecida e passível de ser cultivada. Apesar da importância das técnicas baseadas em cultivo de microrganismos ser indiscutível , a utilização apenas dessas técnicas não é suficiente para um estudo mais abrangente da comunidade microbiana e de suas funções ecológicas em ambientes naturais (PEIXOTO, ROSADO & TAKETANI, 2008). Nesse contexto, as técnicas de biologia molecular oferecem novas oportunidades para as análises de comunidades microbianas e para o biomonitoramento ambiental (MUYZER, DE WAAL & UITTERLINDEN, 1993), possibilitando o estudo da comunidade microbiana a nível genético. Na microbiologia atual, a maioria das metodologias moleculares para estudos da comunidade bacteriana de ambientes natur ais são baseadas na amplificação de genes de interesse por PCR (PHILP et al., 2005b). Essas m etodologias , que incluem o PCR e as metodologias que são baseadas em produtos da amplificação de genes por PCR, como o sequenciamento de DNA (construção de bibliot ecas de clones , pirosequ enciamento, entre outros), DGGE (eletroforese com gradiente desnaturante), RFLP (polimorfismo do tamanho do fragmento de restrição), além de métodos de PCR quantitativo, entre outros, permitem o biomonitoramento de grupos específico s de microrganismos direto no ambiente, de maneira rápida e eficiente (NYYSSÖNEN, PISKONEN & ITÄVAARA, 2006; FLOCCO et al., 2009; WANG, WANG & SHAO, 2010 ).

A coexistência por bilhões de anos das bactérias com diferentes hidrocarbonetos presentes no ambiente permitiu que algumas delas desenvolvessem a capacidade de crescer utilizando hidrocarbonetos do petróleo como fonte de carbono e energia . Diversas estirpes bacterianas pe rtencentes aos gêneros Acanivorax , Cycloclasticus, Thalassolituus , entre outros , são conhecidas como bactérias hidrocarbonoclásticas por possuírem a capacidade de utilizar diferentes hidrocarbonetos como fonte de carbono.

Oppositely, this strain has an extracellular monooxygenase named long -chain alkane monooxygenase (LadA), which is coded by genes located in a plasmid (Feng et al ., 2007). This enzyme acts as a binary complex with coenzyme FMN (mononucleotide flavine), which transforms the alkane in a corresponding alcohol (Li et al ., 2008). Table 2 summarizes the enzymes involved in the hydrolysis o f alkane compounds found in aerobic bacteria.", "THE BACTERIAL SPECIES AND THE GENES CODING FOR AROMATIC HYDROCARBONS DEGRADATION", "Aromatic hydrocarbons are a family of hydrocarbons characterized by the presence of at least one benzene ring (Planckaert, 200 5). They can be monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons , (MAH) such as benzene, xylene, and toluene, or polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) containing two or more fused benzene rings in linear, angular, and cluster arrangements, such as naphthalene, anthracene , and benzo[ α]pyrene (Cerniglia, 2003). These compounds are usual contaminants of soils and groundwater, and the ir environmental presence is worrying because of their mutagenic, ecotoxic, and carcinogenic potential (Habe & Omori, 2003; Jacques et al., 2007 ; Chauhan et al., 2008) .", "The removal of aromatic hydrocarbons from polluted sites by microorganisms represents a prospective solution to environmental problems , and many bacteria species are able to oxidize aromatic hydrocarbons ranging in size from toluen e to benzo[a]pyrene (G ibson & Parales , 2000). However , this family of compounds shows different biodegradability rates . As observed in aliphatic hydrocarbons , while the solubility and volatility decrease , the hydrophobicity increases proportional to the increase of fused benzene rings (Juhasz & Naidu, 2000) . Low -molecular -mass monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (benzene, toluene , and xylene) , considered the most toxic compounds in petroleum , are readily biodegrade d by many bacteria (A tlas, 1995 b). The more co mplex the hydrocarbon structure , the more resistant is its degradation (L eahy & C olwell , 1990). Low -molecular -weight polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons such as naphthalene (two fused rings), phenanthrene (three fused rings, angular arrangements), and anthrac ene (three fused rings, linear arrangements) are also usually readily degraded while high -molar -mass PAHs as pyrene, benzo[ α]pyrene, and benz[ α]anthracene (four or more fused rings) resist to extensive microbial degradation (Goyal & Zylstra, 1997; C ernigli a, 2003). Only a low number of bacteria l isolate s can grow using high-molecular -weight PAH, probably because of the very low biodisponibility of th ese compounds (Johnsen et al., 2005). These compounds a re considered to be oxidized by a consortium of microb es or by isolated bacteria growing with an alternative carbon source (Juhasz & Naidu, 2000) .", "In aerobic biodegradation of aromatic hydrocarbons , bacteria oxidize the aromatic rings by the enzymatic incorporation of atmospheric oxygen into the substrate to form diols . Following reactions result in the formation of precursors of tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA cycle) intermediates (Juhasz & Naidu, 2000; Johnsen et al ., 2005) . General comparison Bacteria and t heir Genes Coding for Enzymes Involved in Bioremediation of Petroleum… among the main rout es of aromatic hydrocarbon degradation showed th at initial pathways are carried out by different enzymes , but that compounds are transformed into a limited number of intermediates (C haudry & Chapalamadugu, 1991). Naphthalene degradation systems are generally used as a model for aerobic aromatic degradat ion. In these pathways, the first step involves the incorporation of two oxygen atoms derived from molecular oxygen into one aromatic nucleus by dioxygenases , decreasing the compound ’s stability. The reaction product is a cis-1,2-naphthalene dihydrodiol. A dehydrogenase act s on this compound generating a 1,2-dihydrox ynaphthalene . Subsequent oxidations allow the opening of one aromatic ring, resulting in salicylaldehyde and pyruvic acid. Then, the salicylaldehyde is transformed in salicylate by salicylaldehy de dehydrogenase. The latter is metabolized generating precursors of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle through catechol or gentisate metabolic pathways (Goyal & Zylstra, 1996; Habe & Omori, 2003; Jacques et al., 2007; Chauhan et al., 2008). The first ste p of the aromatic degradation or the initial ring oxidation is usually the rate - limiting step in the biodegradation reaction (Cerniglia, 1992). In aromatic degradation , this step is mainly catalyzed by a multicomponent dioxygenase, belong ing to a family of aromatic -ring-hydroxylating dioxygenases (RHDs), which generally consist of a reductase, a ferredoxin , and an iron -sulfur protein ( Harayama, 1997 ; Habe & Omori, 2003) . This multicomponent enzyme system transfer s electrons from NADH to the terminal dioxyge nases, which are composed of a large (α) and a small (β) subunit (Zylstra & Gibson, RHDs systems have been extensively studied in many microorganisms , as the initial reaction mostly determines the range of aromatic substrates that can be degraded (Kim et al., 2006). This range is determined mainly by the α-subunit of terminal dioxygenase (Furukawa et al., 2004). I n addition, the origin of many dioxygenase s is determined through the analy sis of the nucleotide or amino acids sequences from the α-subunit (Pieper et al., 2004) . Comparison of the amino acid sequences of α-subunits (ISP α) to terminal oxygenase revealed that they form a family of diverse but evolutionarily related sequences (Witzig et al., 2006). However, d ioxygenases involved in aromatic degradation in Gram -negative bacteria are only distantly related to aromatic dioxygenases from Gram -positive bacteria (Pieper et al., 2004). Several operons coding for aromatic catabolic enzymes have been characterized. Many of them are present in large, self -transmis sible plasmids , such as TOL and NAH plasmids , coding for toluene and naphthalene degradation pathways in Pseudomonas species, respectively (Jussila et al., 2007). This fact might have contributed to the dissemination of this property among prokaryotes (Ma et al ., 2006 ; Akhmetov et al ., 2008 ). Homologo us genes coding for naphthalene degradation pathway are found either in the NAH plasmid or in the chromosome of Pseudomona s stutzeri strain AN10 (Bosch et al., 1999).", "A great amount of genetic information abou t aromatic degradation was first obtained studying Gram -negative bacteria, especially Pseudomonas species. For ex ample, almost all data concerning toluene and xylene oxidation (genes found in large catabolic plasmids named TOL) was described in bacteria be longing to this genus. This plasmid contains xylene monoox ygenase (XMO) genes ( xylM and xylA) that code for the two subunits responsible for monohydroxylat ing the methyl side chain of toluene and its derivatives. This is the first step for toluene degradat ion (Susuki et al ., 1991). The subunit XylM is a monooxygenase transmenbrane related to alkane hydroxilase AlkB (25% of homology) while XylA act s as an electron carrier (Susuki et al ., 1991; Bühler et al ., 2000 ). However, other pathway s for Diogo Jurelevicius and Lucy Seldin toluene degrada tion by Pseudomonas species are known , such as the metabolic pathway coded by tod operon . This operon is located in a catabolic island in the chromosome of Pseudomonas putida F1 (Eaton, 1997) . In this case, toluene is oxidized by a three component enzyme system, called toluene dioxygenase (TDO), where a two subunit terminal dioxygenase ( todC1C2 ) adds two atoms of molecular oxygen into the aromatic nucleus of toluene (Zylstra & Gibson, 1989). Other aromatic compounds, such as styrene, biphenyl, cumene , and n-alkyl benzene , are also metabolized by tod pathway of Pseudomonas putida Another type of dioxygenase that acts in aromatic hydrocarbons is the biphenyl dioxygenase (BPDO). BPDO is responsible for the beginning of the biphenyl degra dation by a dihydroxylation in carbon positions 2 and 3 of the aromatic compound (or at the 2,3 position of the molecule) (Erikson & Mondello, 1992). Different from other aromatic dioxygenases, BPDO (encoded by bphA1A2A3A4 ) is a three -component enzyme cons tituted by four subunits: a large subunit (BphA1) and a small subunit (BphA2) of the terminal dioxygenase, an electron transfer chain constituted by a ferredoxin (BphA3), and a ferredoxin reductase (BphA4) (Furukawa et al., 2004; Takeda et al., 2004). The bph genes are found in both Gram -negative and Gram -positive bacteria. Although they posses only low similarity between each other, it is suggested that they are all derived from the same ancestral origin (Kosono et al., 1997 ; Springael et al., 2001 ). They are related to tod genes (Astúrias et al., 1994) . The bph genes are found on bacterial chromosomes of many Gram -negative bacteria (Furukawa et al., 1989; H ayase et al. , 1990 ), but are also found in conjugative transposons (Furukawa et al ., 2004). While in Gram -negative bacteria the bph genes are clustered in a single locus and in a single set, in Gram -positive bacteria, such as Rhodococcus , diverse biphenyl degradation genes that encode multiple iso enzymes for each metabolic step are distributed among multi ple clusters, sometimes found in plasmids. For example, in Rhodococcus erythropolis TA421, part of the bph genes are located on a linear plasmid (Kosono et al., 1997) . In addition , in Rhodococcus sp. strain RHA1 , the bph genes are found in at least two dif ferent plasmids (pRHL1, pRHL2) and also in the chromosome ( Kitagawa et al., 2001 ; Sakai et al., 2002) . Amino acid sequences of bph genes from Rhodococcus strains share homology to aromatic ring -hydroxylating dioxygenases from Gram -negative bacteria. Howeve r, higher identity was observed with the toluene dioxygenase ( tod) of Pseudomonas putida F1 than with other bph genes from Gram -negative bacteria ( Astúrias et al ., 1994; Masai et al., 1995; Yang et al., 2007 ).", "Sphingobium yanoikuyae B1 is a biphenyl degra der that can also grow in expense of toluene, naphthalene, phenanthrene, anthracene, and other high -molecular -weight HPAs (Gibson, 1999). The genome of this strain possesses at least six sets of putative oxygenase genes (Ferraro et al ., 2007). However, it is possible that BPDO from S. yanoikuyae B1 catalyzes the dioxygenation not only of biphenyl, but also of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons containing up to five fused rings, such as benzo[ a]pyrene (Ferraro et al., 2007; Like the metabolic pathways for monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbon degradation, the routes of polycyclic aromatic degradation were previously described in Pseudomonas . Naphthalene dioxygenases (NDO) are enzymatic systems that oxidize bi - and tri -cyclic PAH substrates, such as naphthalene, phenanthrene , and anthracene ( Peng et al., 2008) . NDO was first described in NAH7 plasmid from Pseudomonas putida G7. NAH7 carries three operons Bacteria and t heir Genes Coding for Enzymes Involved in Bioremediation of Petroleum… related to strain G7 naphthalene degradation: nah operon coding for upper pathway (naphthalene to salicylate ), sal operon coding for lower pathway ( salicylate to cathecol) , and the third codes the regulatory systems of naphthalene pathways (Habe & Omori, 2003). The multicomponent dioxygenase is encoded by nahAaAbAcAd in nah operon. In a ddition , other genes coding for N DO were described in Pseudomonas species. Gene dox in Pseudomonas sp. C18 (Denome et al., 1993), pah in P. putida OUS82 (Takizawa et al., 199 4), and nod in P. putida NCIB 9816 (Kurkela et al., 1988) are usually called “clas sical nah-like genes” as they all possess about 90% of sequence similarity to nah genes from NAH7 plasmid of P. putida G7. These genes were named in accord ance to the substrate utilized by the strain ( phn= phenanthrene; pah= PAH), although all strains also grow with naphthalene as a substrate (Habe & Omori, 2003). In addition, the genes nag identified in Ralstonia sp. U2 and found in Comamonas testosteron i GZ42 are corre lated to those classical nah genes (Z hou et al., 2001). NDO different from those coded b y the classic “nah-like genes” were found in other Gram -negative bacteria. The genes phd of C. testosteroni GZ39 and phn of Burkholderia sp. RP007 are quite different from th ose of classical nah-like genes (G oyal & Zylstra , 1996; Laurie & L loyd-Jones, 1999 ). Another N DO coded by phn genes of the PAH -degrader Cycloclasticus sp. A5 was show n to be different from the nah-nod-dox-pah group (Kasai et al., 2003). Also, genes coding for PAH degradation in Sphingomonas are different from genes found in other genera (Pinyakong et al ., 2003) . These genes seem to be located in a large complex chromosomal gene cluster that encode s enzymes for various aromatic hydrocarbon pathways, such as naphthalene, biphenyl, and xylene degradation (Ferraro et al., 2007) . This gene co mplex is found in a romatic hydrocarbon degrading sphingomonads, such as Sphingobium yanoikuyae B1, Novosphingomo nas aromaticivorans F199 , and Sphingobium sp. strain P2 ( Romine et al., 1999; Pinyakong et al., 2003; Ferraro et al., 2007) . Metabolic pathways for PAH -degradation in Gram -positive bacteria are less studied, although it is postulated that Gram -positive bacteria may be potentially more important for environmental biodegradation than Gram -negative isolates mainly related to high -molecular - weight PA H (Brezna et al., 2003; Cerniglia, 2003; Quatrini et al., 2007). The ability to grow using PAH as carbon and energy sources ha ve been shown in many Gram -positive bacteria, including Rhodococcus , Mycobacterium , Nocardioides , Terrabacter , and Paenibacillus (Saito et al., 1999; Kasuga et al., 2001; Daane et al., 2002; Brezna et al., 2003; Larkin et al., 2005). In Paenibacillus naphthalenovorans, a naphthalene degrading strain isolated from petroleum hydrocarbon contaminated sediment and salt march, no homologo us genes such as nah, phd, and nid (NOD from Mycobacterium vanbaalenii PYR -1) were found (Daane et al ., 2001). The authors believe that novel genes not described so far might act on PAH degradation in this bacterium.", "Gram -positive phenanthrene -utilizing Nocardioides sp. KP7 which degrades phena nthrene via phthalate pathway possess es NDO coded by a set of genes called phd with only 60% of similarity among sequences of other dioxygenases (Saito et al., 1999; 2000). In Rhodococcus sp. NCIMB12038, the genes nar were described as coding for PAH metabolic pathways. It has been demonstrated that NarAa and NarAb (encoding for α and β subunit of NDO respectively ) possess only 30% of amino acid homology to the corresponding P. putida NDO (L arkin et al ., 2005 ). Gene nid has already been characterized in pyrene -utilizing Mycobacterium vanbaalenii PYR -1, where a dioxygenase named NidAB2 initiates the degradation pathway (Khan et al ., 2001). NidA and NidB proteins are only 40 and 56% Diogo Jurelevicius and Lucy Seldin similar to the corresponding isofuncti onal enzymes in Nocardioides sp. strain KP7 and Pseudomonas sp. strain NCIMB12038 , respectively (Kim et al ., 200 6). Unexpectedly , another PAH -hydroxylase found in Mycobacterium vanbaalenii PYR -1 called NidA3B3 showed a higher nucleotide identity to phd dioxygenase from Nocardioides sp. strain KP7 than to nidA previously described in strain PYR -1 (Kim et al., 200 7).", "Only a low number of high -molecular -weight PAH -utilizing bacteria h ave been isolated so far (Johnsen et al ., 2005). HMW PAHs -utilizing bacteri a such as Mycobacterium vanbaalenii PYR1 (Kim et al ., 2006), Sphingomonas sp. strain CHY -1 (Jakoncic et al ., 2007), and Sphingobium yanoikuyae B1(Yu et al ., 2007) are able to use low -molecular - weight HPA and also oxidize large aromatic hydrocarbons such a s benzo[ a]pyrene, benzo[ a]anthracene , and chrysene. The pathways of HMW PAH degradation ha ve already been described in the above mentioned bacteria and the same genes that code for LMW PAH degradation in M. vanbaalenii PYR1 and in S. yanoikuyae B1 (nid and bph genes, respectively) act also in HMW -PAH (Kim et al, 2006; Ferraro et al., 2007; Yu et al., 2007). The same is observed in Sphingomonas sp. strain CHY -1 where a dioxygenase coded by the phn genes act s on at least 8 PAH compounds including four-ring ch rysene and benz[a]anthracene, and on the five -ring benzo[a]pyrene (Jakoncic et al., 2007).", "Other HMW PAHs -utilizing bacteria, such as Stenotrophomonas maltophilia strain VUN 10003, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Burkholderia cepacia, Flavobacterium sp., Cycloclas ticus sp., and actinomycetes from the genera Mycobacterium , Gardonia , Rhodococcus , among others , have been isolated. Although the number of high -molecular -weight PAH -utilizing isolates has been increasing in the past 10 years, information concerning the me tabolism of HMW PAHs is still to be obtained (Chauhan et al., 2008).", "BACTERIAL MULTICOMPONENT MONO OXYGENASES (BMMS ), A SOLUBLE COMPLEX THAT ACTS IN MICROBIAL DEGRADATION OF AROMATIC AND ALIPHATIC HYDROCARBONS", "Short alkanes (C1 -C8), alkenes , and aromat ic hydrocarbons are converted to alcohols, phenol , and expoxides, respectively, by enzymes called bacterial multicomponent monooxygenases (BMMs) (Sazinsky & Lippard, 2006; Notomista et al., 2009). BMMs are soluble multicomponent enzymes from a family of no n-heme, diiron proteins. They use the carboxylate -bridged diiron centre of their hydroxylases to convert a variety of hydrocarbons to hydroxylate in a reaction that requires NAD(P)H as an electron donor (Leahy et al., 2003; Notomista et al., 2003; Lippard, 2005) . Each BMM contains several proteins, but at least a hydroxylase, a reductase , and a small regulatory component are required for the efficient coupling of electron consumption with hydrocarbon oxidation ( Lippard, 2005 , Murray & Lippard, 2007 ). Howeve r, usually BMMs contain three or four general components: a dimeric hydroxylase protein formed by two or three subunits (α2β2 or α2β2γ2), a FAD -containing redutase that shuttles electron from NADH to the diiron center of hydroxylase (N component) , a small effector or coupling protein (R subunit) , and in some cases a Rieske -type ferredoxin protein mediating the electron transfer to diiron center of the hydroxylase complex (Leahy et al., 2003 ; Sazinsky & Lippard, 2006 ). It is probable that BMMs use very simi lar Bacteria and t heir Genes Coding for Enzymes Involved in Bioremediation of Petroleum… catalytic mechanisms, although their substrates specificity can vary a lot (Notomista et al., All know n BMMs so far are transcribed in a single operon that codes for four to six polypeptides (Notomista et al ., 2003) . The evolutionary relationsh ip of BMMs was established comparing the operon subunits structure based on α, β, N, and R conserved components and operon organization. Five phylogenetic BMM groups have been defined , and they are presented hereafter. However , it is important to state tha t the BMMs classification has been correlated to the bacterial phenotype (ability to grow using specifics hydrocarbon) and not to their phylogeny, which suggests that these pathways might have been evolved through horizontal gene transfer ( Notomista et al., 2003 ). Group 1 (PH phenol hydroxylases) and group 2 (toluene -benzene monooxygenases) are involved in aromatic hydrocarbons hydroxylation (Haddock, 2010), while group 3 ( MMO methane monooxygenase ), group 4 (AMO alkene monooxygenase), and group 5 (THMO tet rahydrofluran/propane monooxygenase) are involved in converting mainly short aliphatic hydrocarbon s (Coleman et al., 2006; Sazinski & Lippard, 2006). It is likely that enzymes characterized from the strains isolated so far represent only a small fraction o f the total biochemical diversity and biotechnological potential of the BMMs family (Galv ão et al., 2005).", " BMMs from group 1: the three -component phenol hydroxylase (PHs) group", "The BMMs from group 1 are composed of enzymatic systems related to three -comp onent phenol hydroxylases (PHs). These include the phenol hydroxylases as Dmp phenol hydroxylase from Pseudomonas sp. strain CF600, and enzymes involved in toluene hydroxylation, as toluene -2-monooxygenase (T2MO) from Burkholderia vietnamiensis G4 (Notomis ta et al., 2003 ; Parales et al., 2008). These enzymes are able to oxidize phenol and methyl -substituted phenols. In addition, T2MO ( tomA1A2A3A4A5 ), which is encoded on self - transmissible plasmid TOM of B. vietnamiensis G4 ( Shields et al ., 1995), is able to incorporate one atom of oxygen from dioxygen in more than a single position of the aromatic ring in two consecutive monooxygenation reactions (Cafaro et al ., 2004), and is able to hydroxylate hydrocarbons, such as benzene, toluene, naphthalene, and other unactivated hydrocarbons including short -chain alkenes (Yeager et al ., 1999; McClay et al ., 2000). However, some PHs exhibit a substrate range similar to that of T2MO ( Johnson & Olsen , 1995; Teramoto et al ., 1999; Leahy et al ., 2003). This group of BMMs ha s already been described in Beta and Gammaproteobacteria, such as the PHs from Pseudomonas , Comamonas , and Ralstonia , and T2MO from Pseudomonas and Burkholderia (Johnson & Olsen , 1995 ; Teramoto et al., 1999; Leahy et al ., 2003; Cafaro et al., 2004, Parales et al.,", " BMMs from group 2: the four-component alkene monooxygenase and aromatic ring monooxygenases", "The BMMs from group 2 are characterized by four component alkene monooxy genase s (AMO) from Xanthobacter strain Pys (Zhou et al., 1999) and by clos ely related aromatic ring monooxygenases that exhibit overlapping substrate specificity. These latter enzymes catalyze the monohydroxylation of benzene, toluene, and phenol compounds (Leahy et al., 2003). Diogo Jurelevicius and Lucy Seldin The first studied aromatic monooxygenase in this gr oup was the toluene 4 - monooxygenase (T4MO), encoded by the genes tmoABCDE in Pseudomonas mendocina KR1 (Pikus et al ., 1996). Studies have shown that T4MO possesses a wide substrate specificity, which includes ethylbenzene and C 3 to C 8 alkenes (McClay et al., 2000). Other aromatic monooxygenases related to T4MO were found in Alpha, Beta , and Gammaproteobacteria. BMM toluene 3 -monooxygenase (T3MO) is coded by the genes tbuA1UBVA2C located in the chromosome of Ralstonia pickettii PkO1 ( Byrne et al., 1995). It is also found in Burkholderia cepacia AA1 and is another toluene monooxygenase belonging to group 2 that is able to hydroxylate toluene, benzene, ethylbenzene , and other hydrocarbons (Notomista et al ., 2003; Parales et al ., 2008). While T4MO from P. mendon cina KR1 catalyzes the hydroxylation of C4 position of toluene, T3MO from R. pickettii PkO1 catalyzes the hydroxylation of C3 (Parales et al., 2008; Haddock, 2010). Oppositely to that observed with T3MO and T4MO, a group 2 toluene/ o-xylene monooxygenase (T oMO) from Pseudomonas stutzeri OX1 (genes touABCDEF ) exhibits relaxed region specificity for the positions of substrate hydroxylation (Bertoni et al., 1996; Bertoni et al., 1998; Barbieri et al., 2001). However, this BMM can also hydroxylate benzene and ot her aromatic hydrocarbons (Haddock, 2010). It is known that all toluene monooxygenase producing strain s can catalyze the expoxidation of short -chain -alkenes (McClay et al., 2000).", "Alkene monooxygenase coded by chromosomal genes aamABCDEF from Xanthobacter strain Pys (XAMO) is closely related to the toluene/benzene monooxygenase family (Leahy et al ., 2003; Notomista et al ., 2003) . This enzyme can also catalyze the aromatic monohydroxylation of toluene, benzene , and phenol (Zhou et al., 1999 ). It has been al ready shown that XAMO presents more sequence similarity to monooxygenases like toluene (TMO), benzene (BMO), and methane (MMO) monooxygenases, than to alkene monooxygenase from Rhodococcus coralinus B-276 (Zhou et al., 1998).", " BMMs from group 3: methane m onooxygenase (MMO)", "BMMs from group 3 are composed by a soluble methane monooxygenase, which catalyze one of the most difficult reactions observed in nature : the hydroxylation of highly stable methane compounds to methanol (Kopp & Lippard, 2002; Leahy et al., 2003). MMOs are found in all bacteria that use methane as carbon and energy sources for growth, generally Alpha and Gammaproteobacteria (Murrell et al ., 2000; Kopp & Lippard, 2002). In methanotrophic bacteria, two types of MMO are observed. One of them , a copper -containing membrane bound enzyme is called particulate methane monooxygenase (pMMO), which is coded by the genes pmoCAB . Two copies of this operon are generally present in the genome of the majority of methanotrophs (Murrell et al., 2000). The o ther MMO is a soluble iron - containing enzyme named soluble methane monooxygenase (sMMO) that is coded by mmoXYBZC genes (McDonald et al ., 1997; van Beilen & Funhoff, 2007). Almost all methanotrophs possess pMMO while only a few of them also have sMMO. In s trains possessing both MMOs, the sMMO expression occurs in low copper availability conditions (Rojo, 2009). Although less widespread in methanotrophs, t he sMMOs are more studied and understood than pMMO. It is known that sMMOs generally exhibit broad speci ficities, catalyzing the insertion of oxygen into a number of different hydrocarbon compounds, Bacteria and t heir Genes Coding for Enzymes Involved in Bioremediation of Petroleum… including substituted methanes, alkanes, cycloalkanes, alkenes, haloalkenes, and aromatic and heterocyclic hydrocarbons (Sazinski & Lippard, 2006 ; Rojo, 2009).", "Pseudomonas butanovora , a bacterium that can grow with C 2-C8 alkanes , possesses a BMM related to soluble butane monooxygenase (sBMO) coded by the genes bmoXYBZDC that is highly related to sMMO from methanotrophs (Sluis et al., 2002; Rojo, 2009). Another strain, a propane -utilizing Gordonia sp. TY -5 possesses a propane monooxygenase also similar to sMMO (Kotani et al., 2007). However, the propane monooxygenase of Gordonia sp. TY -5 belongs to group 5 of BMMs, as described below .", " BMMs from group 4: Amo Alke ne Monoxygenases (AMOs)", "The forth group of BMMs is characterized by Amo alkene monooxygenase (AMO) described in Rhodococcus coralinus B-276. This soluble aliphatic alkene hydroxylase is coded by the genes amoABCD (Ensign, 2001; Perry & Smits, 2006). Anoth er BMM, propene monooxygenase (PMO) coded by the genes pmoABCD in Mycobacterium sp. strain M156, is closed related to Amo alkene monooxygenase from R. coralinus B-276. It is proposed that PMO is a second member of BMM from group 4 (Chion et al., 2005; Perr y & Smits, 2006). AMOs related to PMO ha ve been described in the propene -assimilating strain Gordonia B- 276 (Saeki & Furuhashi, 1994 ) and in ethene -assimilating strain Mycobacterium JS60 (EtnABCD) (Coleman & Spain , 2003 ) and in strain Nocardioides sp. JS61 4 (EtnABCD) (Mattes et al., 2005).", " BMMs from group 5: tetrahydrofuran/propane monooxygenases (THMOs)", "BMMs from group five are composed mainly by a tetrahydrofuran monooxygenase (Thm) described in Pseudonocardia sp. SK1 (Thiemer et al ., 200 3), and by prop ane monooxygenase (Pmr) related to sMMO that were found in Gordonia sp. TY -5 (Kotani et al., 2003). Propane monooxygenase related to Pmr has already been found in propane -utilizing Mycobacterium sp. TY -6 and Pseudonocardia sp. TY-7 (Kotani et al ., 2006). B esides the Thm and Pmr, monooxygenases found in the genome of Bradyrhizobium japonicum USDA 110, Rhodobacter sphaeroides 2.4.1 , and Rubrivivax gelatinosus PM1 are related to group 5 BMM s (Coleman et al., 2006).", "CONCLUSION", "Aerobic utilizing -hydrocarbon b acteria possess a group of enzymes, called oxygenases, which initiate hydrocarbon degradation through the introduction of one or both oxygen atoms from dioxygen into their substrates. Although different enzymes have already been described, it is possible that oxygenases characterized from bacterial strains so far represent only a small fraction of the ir biochemical diversity and biotechnological potential in the natural environment.", "Diogo Jurelevicius and Lucy Seldin REFERENCES", "Akhmetov, L.I., Filonov, A.E., Puntus, I.F., Kosheleva, I.A., Nechaeva, I.A., Yonge, D.R., Petersen, J.N. & Boronin, A.M.

Para atingir esse objetivo, o gene bio marcador da degradação bacteriana de alcanos, que codifica a enzima alcano -monoxigenase AlkB (gene alkB), foi utilizado como alvo para as análises moleculares (métodos independentes do cultivo de microrganismos ). Após a detecção por PCR do gene alkB presen te nos DNAs extraídos das comunidades microbianas presentes nos diferentes solos, o produto da amplificação por PCR foi submetido a análises do Polimorfismo de Tamanho do Fragmento de Restrição (PCR -RFLP) e de Eletroforese em Gradiente Desnaturante ( PCR -DGGE). Os primeiros resultados indicaram a presença de comunidades complexas de bactérias degradadoras de alcanos em solos contaminados e não contaminados da Antártica. A s análises dos dendrogramas obtidos dos perfis do PCR -RFLP e do PCR -DGGE, bem como as análises de Correspondência Canônica (CCA) desses perfis, mostraram que as características químicas e físico -químicas dos diferentes solos, como o tipo de solo e/ou o pH e a quantidade de hidrocarbonetos totais do petróleo (TPH), afetam a distribuição das bactérias degradadoras de alcanos nos solos estudados. A análise de partição da variância ( Partitioning of Variance ) dos perfis de PCR -DGGE mostrou que o pH é o fator ambiental que mais contribui u para a variação observada na distribuição de bactérias degradadoras de alcanos ( 15,4% ) seguido pelo TPH ( 14,1% ). No total, todos os fatores físico -químicos estudados nesse estudo contribuíram com 60% da variação observada na distribuição da comunidade de bactérias degradadoras de alcanos nos solos estudados. A identificação molecular, através do sequenciamento de DNA, de 20 bandas extraídas dos perfis do PCR -DGGE revelaram a presença de genes que codificam AlkB com baixas identidades (61-91%) com outros genes alkB já descritos em bactérias Gram -positivas dos gê neros Mycobacterium , Gordonia , Rhodococcus e Aeromicrobium .

Introduction", "Natural environments have increasingly been affected by petroleum-derived fuel spills around the world. These spills are a threat to unique, remote and sensitive environments, such as Antarctica, which comprises one of the last remaining pristine zones on Earth [1,2].", "The petroleum-derived fuel (DFA), which is widely used to generate energy at the Antarctic research stations, is rich in aliphatic hydrocarbons with a length of 8 e30 carbons, and the n- C11 alkane is the predominant hydrocarbon [3]. The presence of these compounds in Antarctic soils represents a hazard to envi- ronmental safety [4]. However, many bacteria have the ability to utilize aliphatic hydrocarbons as carbon and energy sources togrow [5]. Alkane-degrading bacteria are widespread among the Bacteria domain [6], and these bacteria are viewed as an important tool for the clean-up of polluted environments.One of the key enzymes involved in bacterial alkane degradation is the alkane monooxygenase, AlkB, which acts in a chain reactionwith electron carriers (rubredoxin and rubredoxin reductase) to reduce the alkane to an alcohol (1-alkanol) that enters bacterial b- oxidation pathways [7].A sw a s ﬁrst described in the Pseudomonas putida strain Gpo1, which has the ability to grow utilizing C6 eC12 alkanes [8], the alkane monooxygenase AlkB pathway has been found in most bacteria that are able to use alkanes as a carbon source [9]. Therefore, the alkB gene can be used as a biomarker to monitor the presence and diversity of alkane-degrading bacteria inthe environment [10,11] . Bioremediation of Antarctic soils is restricted due to the lack of knowledge about hydrocarbon-degrading microorganisms [12].", "Moreover, the distribution of alkane-degrading bacteria amongAntarctic soils is poorly studied. To date, alkane-degrading bacteria from Antarctic soils have been mainly studied by limited culturing- based methods and/or qualitative and quantitative PCR techniques (hybridization and quantitative PCR) [13,14] . Oil-degrading bacteria isolated from hydrocarbon-polluted and unpolluted Antarctic soils generally belong to Gram-negative Acinetobacter ,Sphingomonas and Pseudomonas and Gram-positive Rhodococcus and Arthrobacter genera [14].

Culture-independent studies focusing on cata- bolic genes of interest represent prospective solutions to overcome the limitations of culturing-bacteria to directly look for target microorganisms in the environment.", "Fingerprint analyses of microbial communities have become especially relevant, as they enable the understanding of how ecosystems are structured for the management of bioremedia- tion [15]. We hypothesize that alkane-degrading bacteria are widely distributed in soils from King George Island, MaritimeAntarctic, and that the bacterial communities found there cluster according to the properties of the different soils. Therefore, our research has the potential to identify bacterial communities that could be used to increase the rate of degradation of contami- nants in each soil studied. To this end, we used the alkane- degradation biomarker ( alkB gene) in combination with molec- ular (PCR and ﬁngerprint methods) and statistical (Canonical Correspondence Analysis eCCAeand partitioning of variance) tools to compare alkane-degrading bacterial communities fromdifferent Antarctic soils.", "2.

Results", "3.1. Soil samples and total petroleum hydrocarbon (TPH)", "determination All soil samples were collected in triplicate near the Brazilian Station of Research Comandante Ferraz (EAFC) located in KingGeorge Island, which is part of the Maritime Antarctic, as illus- trated in Fig. 1 . Physicochemical variables were assessed from polluted and pristine soils in an effort to characterize these KingGeorge Island soils. Low variations were observed among polluted soils ‘A’,‘B’and ‘C’(Table 1 ). The results showed that soils from King George Island varied from extremely acidic (soils ‘D’and ‘F’) to neutral (polluted soils ‘A’,‘B’and ‘C’), based on pH soil classi- ﬁcation [25]. Soil ‘E’was classi ﬁed as a moderately acidic soil. Additionally, the soils markedly varied in relation to potassium (K), aluminum (Al), organic carbon (OC), and phosphorus (P) compositions ( Table 1 ). Soils collected around the EACF fuel tanks showed a gradient of hydrocarbon values: ‘A’(20,619 ‘C’(6501 mgg/C01)a n d ‘B’(5198 mgg/C01). Furthermore, the methodused did not detect petroleum hydrocarbon in pristine soils ( ‘D’,‘E’ and ‘F’,Table 1 ).", "3.2. Restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP)", "High molecular weight DNA was successfully extracted from all samples, yielding up to 50 ng/ ml of DNA (soil ‘B’).

The combination of different fragments generated in each of the three endonuclease reactions was considered the alkB polymorphism of each soil sample studied. The resulting dendrogram revealed that the most importantdifference was observed between hydrocarbon-polluted and pris- tine soils ( Fig. 2 B). Pristine soils ‘E’and ‘F’were separated from soil ‘D’at approximately 40% similarity, suggesting an in ﬂuence of the soil type. Moreover, hydrocarbon-polluted soils were grouped according to the TPH values, and sample ‘A’, which was highly polluted, was grouped apart from samples ‘B’and ‘C’, which remained together in the dendrogram ( Fig. 2 B).", "Fig. 3.

Different and unique band patterns were observed among different samples, although some common bands were detected in all samples ( Fig. 3 A). Clustering analysis corroborated the visual interpretation of the DGGE pro ﬁles (Fig. 3 B). Hydrocarbon-polluted samples were separated from pristine samples in the dendrogram. As was observed with PCR-RLFP analyses, the highest contaminated soil ( ‘A’) formed a cluster with less than 50% similarity with the hydrocarbon-contaminated soils ( ‘B’and ‘C’), which were not separated in the dendrogram ( Fig. 3 B). In the group of pristine soils, the loamy soils, ‘E’and ‘F’, were separated with less than 35% similarity, while the clayey soil, ‘D’, was separated with less than 25% similarity from soils ‘E’and ‘F’.", "3.4. Analysis of the sequences of dominant DGGE bands", "In total, 20 bands (indicated by numbers in DGGE patterns e Fig. 3 A) were sequenced and analyzed. All sequenced bands were related (61 e90% similarity) to the alkane monooxygenase AlkB gene already deposited in the GenBank database. The results of sequenceidenti ﬁcation using the BLAST-X algorithm are shown in Table 2 . Analysis of the geographical isolation source of the AlkB sequencesrevealed that the ﬁrst hits that matched the sequenced bands were derived from hydrocarbon contaminated and uncontaminatedseawater, shorelines and forest soils ( Table 2 ). Half of the sequenced bands showed high similarity with AlkB from uncultivated bacteria.Therefore, we considered the ﬁrst hit matching to a cultivated alkane-degrading bacterium in order to reach the closest phyloge-netic position of the sequences obtained here. The results showed that 85% of the sequenced bands were associated with AlkB previ- ously identi ﬁed as belonging to Actinobacteria, including Rhodo- coccus ,Gordonia ,Mycobacterium and Aeromicrobium genera. AlkB-related sequences of alkane monooxygenase of Gram-negative Alcanivorax an dKordiimonas genera (of Gamma and Alphaproteo- bacteria, respectively) corresponded to 15% of the DGGE sequenced bands ( Table 2 ).", "DGGE band sequences associated with AlkB from Mycobacte- rium chubuense NBB4 (bands 2, 3, 4 and 5) were found in all hydrocarbon-polluted soils. However, the alkB gene related to Aeromicrobioum marinum DSM15272 (DGGE band 14) was the only sequenced band found simultaneously in hydrocarbon-pollutedand pristine samples (soils ‘C’and ‘E’, respectively). When hit matching to a cultivated bacterium was ﬁrst considered, bands 15 and 16 were found only in soil ‘D’and were associated with Gor- donia soli and Alcanivorax borkumensis , respectively. Bands 17 and 18, from soil ‘F’, showed similarity with AlkB from Rhodococcus sp. P14 and Nocardia sp. SoB, respectively.", "3.5. Canonical correspondence analyses (CCA) of RFLP and DGGEpatterns The results of CCA ( Fig. 4 A and B) showed congruent distribution patterns when both molecular ﬁngerprint methods were used.", "Polluted soils were separated from pristine soils by axis 1 in both RFLP-CCA and DGGE-CCA analyses. High TPH-content soil ( ‘A’)w a s separated by axis 2 from polluted soils ‘B’and ‘C’, when biplot ordination was considered ( Fig. 4 A and B). However, DGGE-CCA and RFLP-CCA analyses slightly differed in the ordination of pristinesoils. While RFLP-CCA analysis separated the pristine soils accord- ing to soil type, DGGE-CCA analysis separated pristine soils in relation to the pH conditions of the samples. DGGE-CCA analysis also showed the relationship between sequenced alkB genes and environmental characteristics of the soil samples ( Fig. 4 B). For example, alkB genes associated with AlkB from G. soli and A. bor- kumensis (bands 15 and 16, respectively) were correlated with higher acidic soil conditions.

While pH contributed 15.4% to the composition of these communities, TPH and the set of the other soil variables contributed 14.1% and 27.5%, respectively.", "4. Discussion", "This research is part of a continued effort to gain a better understanding of the potential for degradation of oil pollutants in Antarctic sites. The long-term consequences of this study include the development of protocols for the remediation of pollution in Antarctic environments.", "We found that alkane-degrading bacteria were widespread in extremely acid soils and neutral soils, in low-organic matter content and in hydrocarbon-contaminated soils from King George Island, Maritime Antarctica. Evaluating the alkane-degrading bacteria by culturing [4]and/or PCR-hybridization [13] techniques has always been a problem due to their scarcity in pristine soils ofthe Antarctic. The presence of alkane-degrading bacteria was previously correlated with the availability of organic matter in Antarctic soils, as alkane-degrading bacteria was readily detected in pristine ornithogenic soils, which are high organic content soils derived from the deposition of fecal matter from various species of birds [1,26] . However, the physicochemical characteristics of soils from most of previous studies were not available for comparison. Using two different ﬁngerprint methods, the results showed wide distribution of alkane-degrading bacteria among King George Island soils. Importantly, RFLP ﬁngerprints correlated with DGGE ﬁngerprint analyses, indicating the con ﬁdence of the results obtained (Figs. 2B and 3B). The clustering pattern in the dendro- grams (RFLP and DGGE data) obtained from biological data was inaccordance to the different physicochemical properties of soils (Table 1 , Figs. 2B and 3B), indicating that environmental factors correlated with alkane-degrading bacterial distribution amongKing George Island soils. As most of the soils studied were classi ﬁed as loamy soils, except for soil ‘D’, it was not possible to determine whether soil type in ﬂuenced the distribution of alkane-degradingbacteria on King George Island. Previous studies found that pHwas the principal factor in ﬂuencing the structure of microbial communities in soils [27,28] , although the in ﬂuence of TPH on microbial community had already been shown [11,29,30] . In this study, neither TPH nor pH alone in ﬂuenced the alkane-degrading bacterial structure of hydrocarbon-polluted and pristine soils. The partitioning of variance analysis, based on DGGE data, showed that pH and TPH together contributed 30% to the composition of alkane- degrading bacteria. The more plausible hypothesis is that a combi- nation of the different characteristics observed in King George Island soils is responsible for the selection of the alkane-degrading bacterial communities, since the other soil variables (such as OM, S, AleTable 1 ) also contributed 27.5% to the composition of alkane- degrading bacterial communities observed.", "Because a considerable difference was observed between hydrocarbon-polluted soils and pristine soils, these samples werestudied as two individual groups so that a deeper correlation between alkB div ersity and environmental characteristics could be deﬁned. Dendrogram ordinations showed that soil type affected the distribution of alkane-degrading bacteria in pristine soils (Figs. 2B and 3B). However, TPH levels ( Table 1 ) clearly in ﬂuenced the spatial distribution of the alkane-degrading bacteria in pollutedsoils, which showed no pH differences ( Fig. 4 A and B). Thus, we hypothesize that the TPH content could affect the alkane-degradingbacteria from polluted soil in negative or positive ways: (i) a high concentration of hydrocarbons could be toxic for some alkane- degrading bacteria, and (ii) high levels of THP provide high concentrations of carbon source (alkanes) for alkane-degrading bacteria, both in ﬂuencing the bacterial diversity [11,31] .", "To tentatively identify the alkane-utilizing bacteria from hydrocarbon-polluted and pristine soils, the predominant bandsfrom DGGE patterns were extracted, reampli ﬁed and sequenced. When the ﬁrst hit in BLAST-X was considered, none of the alkB gene sequences could be associated with AlkB-coding genes isolated from Antarctic soils in previous studies (for example, sequences obtained by Kuhn et al. [10])(Table 2 ). Nevertheless, we are aware that most studies into the diversity of alkB have been performed by clone library construction rather than isolation procedures.

Jurelevicius et al. / European Journal of Soil Biology 51 (2012) 37 e44 42 deposited in GenBank suggests the presence of new alkB genes in King George Island soils. Therefore, alkB diversity is far from being elucidated, and many recent publications have shown the isolation of novel AlkB-coding genes in different environments [10,32] . Our results con ﬁrm that soils from Antarctic environments are hotspots for microbial metabolic diversity.", "Most of the bands sequenced showed similarity with AlkB of high GC-content Gram-positive bacteria in King George soils ( Table 2 ). This result is in agreement with previous reports by Whyte et al. [13] and Luz et al. [33], who suggested that alkB related to rhodococcal bacteria are more widely distributed in polar soils than the alkB gene from Pseudomonas spp. High GC-content Gram-positive bacteria are known as versatile microorganisms that might play a key role inbioremediation of alkane-contaminated sites under resource-limited conditions, as already showed by Quatrini et al. [34]. We believe that high GC-content Gram-positive bacteria should be more resistant tothe harsh environmental conditions found in Antarctic soils, including the freeze ethaw cycles, than Gram-negative bacteria. The resistance to freeze ethaw cycles by rhodococcal bacteria has already been shown by Eriksson et al. [35] and others.", "The results obtained in this study show that alkane-degrading bacteria are not uniformly distributed throughout King GeorgeIsland soils. The patterns of distributions were affected by multiple factors: (i) each soil possessing different environmental physico- chemical properties has a particular alkane-degrading bacterial diversity; (ii) TPH content is a key factor in ﬂuencing alkB diversity in contaminated samples with similar physicochemical properties;(iii) this diversity can also be in ﬂuenced by soil type or OM, P and S contents, as shown in pristine soils. Moreover, the recovered alkanemonooxygenase genes suggest a high diversity of this gene in King George Island soils, including many sequences not yet described in Antarctic environments.", "Because the microbial target can include different bacterial groups among different soils, we assumed that the different alkane- degrading bacterial communities could present different responses to bioremediation treatments. Many authors have suggested that the introduction of hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria that would respond better to bioremediation treatments would increase the degradation rate [36], while others have shown variable efﬁ ciencies in polar soils, as indicated by Thomassin-Lacroix et al. [37] and by Vázquez et al. [38]. The major problem concerning bio- augmentation is the ability of introduced bacteria to adapt to soilproperties. Here, we identi ﬁed numerous alkane monooxygenase AlkB-coding genes from bacteria adapted to different soils fromKing George Island, in Maritime Antarctica. Therefore, we predict that the isolation and characterization of bacteria harboring these genes might be a possibility to overcome the bacterial adaptation problems and increase the bioremediation rate in Antarctic soils.

Para avaliar se essas bactérias estão amplamente distribuídas em solos antárticos e caracterizar as comunidades de bactérias degradadoras de hidrocarbonetos poliaromáticos que sã o enriquecidas pela presença de contaminantes, foram analisados diferentes solos da Ilha do Rei George, contaminados ou não com hidrocarbonetos do petróleo. Para acessar especificamente a comunidade bacteriana de interesse , foi utilizado como biomarcador o gene que codifica a subunidade α das dioxigenases de hidroxilação de hidrocarbonetos poliaromáticos (PAH -RHDα) . Com esse objetivo, foram utilizadas análises moleculares através da amplificação do gene PAH -RHDα por PCR, seguida da construção de bibliotecas de clones e do sequenciamento de DNA. As sequências de DNA obtidas foram traduzidas para obtenção das sequências deduzidas de aminoácidos, e todas as sequências geradas foram analisadas através das ferramentas BLAST ( Basic Local Alignment Search Tool ), CO G (Clusters of Orthologous Groups of Proteins ) e KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes ). Na maioria dos solos não contaminados com hidrocarbonetos do petróleo não foi detectada a presença de genes que codificam a PAH-RHDα de bactérias Gram -positivas e bactérias Gram -negativas. Somente em um solo não contaminado foram detectadas sequências de PAH -RHDα de bactérias Gram - negativas e a análise dess as sequências mostrou a presença de PAH -RHDα relacionadas com dioxigenases NagAc descritas em Ralstonia sp.

A análise através do teste métrico UniFrac da diversidade beta dos genes PAH -RHDα de bactérias Gram -negativas mostrou que a distribuição da comunidade degradadora de HPA pode ser influenciada pela concentração de hidrocarbonetos totais do petróleo (TPH) no ambiente. Através do mesmo teste, a influência do TPH não pode ser correlacionada com a distribuição da comunidade de bact érias Gram -positivas degradadoras de HPA.

Introduction", "Antarctic environments present a particular microbiological community as a result of the harsh conditions found in this conti- nent. However, anthropogenic activities, including the use of fossil fuels as an energy source, may harm the ecological equilibrium of the Antarctic environments (Aislabie and Foght, 2010 ). The fuel generally used in Antarctica research stations (diesel oil denoted as DFA) is a mixture of petroleum hydrocarbons possessing up to 35% of potentially mutagenic, ecotoxic and carcinogenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons – PAH (Chauhan et al., 2008 ). Moreover, PAH are highly persistent in soils because they are difﬁcult to be biodegraded (Yergeau et al., 2009 ). The use of physical–chemical ∗Corresponding author at: Laboratório de Genética Microbiana, Departamento de Microbiologia Geral, Instituto de Microbiologia Prof. Paulo de Góes (IMPPG), Uni- versidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro, Centro de Ciências da Saúde, Bloco I, Ilha do Fundão, fax:", "E-mail addresses: lseldin@micro.ufrj.br , lucy@seldin.com.br (L. Seldin).remediation processes may have prohibitive costs, considering the distance of the Antarctic continent, and can also be as harmful as the contamination itself. Therefore, bioremediation methods based on the ability of microbes to utilize PAH compounds as carbon and energy sources represent a promising solution to the prob- lems associated with Antarctic environmental cleanup (Aislabie and Foght, 2010 ).", "To date, most of the studies about PAH-degradation have used culture-based approaches, and predominantly Gram-negative bac- teria (mainly from Pseudomonas and Sphingomonas genera) have been identiﬁed as the PAH-degrading bacteria in Antarctic soils (Panicker et al., 2010; Ma et al., 2006 ). Culture-independent meth- ods targeting speciﬁc metabolic genes would allow for a broader estimation of the biodegradation potential of these environments. Ring-hydroxylating dioxygenases related to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon oxidation (PAH-RHD), such as those encoded by the nah, nod and phn genes in Gram-negative bacteria and the evolu- tionarily correlated nid, nir and nar genes in Gram-positive bacteria, catalyze the ﬁrst step of the PAH degradation pathway (Khan et al., 2001; Saito et al., 2000; Larkin et al., 1999 ). Genes coding for the catalytic domain of PAH-RHDs (/H9251-subunit) have been widely used 0929-1393/$ – see front matter © 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved. 2 D. Jurelevicius et al. / Applied Soil Ecology 55 (2012) 1– 9 as biomarkers of a PAH-degrading potential in different environ- ments, making this subunit an important tool for studying RHD biodiversity (Ding et al., 2010; Flocco et al., 2009; Marcos et al., Luz et al. (2004) have already described the presence of Pseudomonas related-naphthalene dioxygenase (nodB ) genes and other genes coding for enzymes involved in monoaromatic- hydrocarbons degradation in soils around the Brazilian Antarctic Station. Also, the diversity of Pseudomonas related-naphthalene dioxygenases (NOD) genes was studied by Flocco et al. (2009) in chronicle-contaminated soils from Jabulani Station and from Potter Peninsula in Maritime Antarctic. However, the catabolic potential of Antarctic soils is still poorly understood. The PAH-degrading potential of Gram-positive bacteria in Antarctic soils is essentially unknown, although Gram-positive bacteria may be more important than Gram-negative bacteria for the environmental biodegradation of high molecular weight PAH (Cerniglia, 2003 ).", "The knowledge of the bacterial potential for PAH-degradation in Antarctic soils is essential for the management of soils for biore- mediation. Considering that Gram-positive and Gram-negative PAH-degrading bacteria are present in Antarctic soils but they have been underestimated by traditional culturing-based methods used in previous studies, we used culture-independent methods based on PCR-cloning-sequencing analysis of /H9251-subunit of ring- hydroxylating dioxygenases (RHD /H9251) in this study aiming to answer the following questions: (i) are PAH-degrading bacteria widely distributed in diesel oil-contaminated and non-contaminated (pristine) soils from King George Island in the Maritime Antarctic, independently of the soil characteristics?; (ii) how is the diver- sity of PAH-RHD /H9251coding genes in PAH-degrading bacteria present in these soils? Primers speciﬁc for the ampliﬁcation of PAH /H9251- subunit RHD (PAH-RHD /H9251) encoding genes from Gram-positive and -negative bacteria were used followed by a combination of PCR- sequencing and statistical methodologies. The resulting data may indicate the biodegradation potentiality of these sensitive and unique environments.", "Materials and methods 2.1. Samples sites and total petroleum hydrocarbon (TPH) determination The study was carried out at the Brazilian Antarctic Station Comandante Ferraz (EACF, 62◦05/primeS, 058◦23.5/primeW). Approximately 500 g of soil samples were collected from different sites located on King George Island, Antarctic Peninsula, which is part of the South Shetlands archipelago in Maritime Antarctica (Fig. 1), and they were stored at −20◦C.The diesel oil-contaminated soils were sampled adjacent to Brazilian Antarctic Station Comandante Ferraz in March 2009 (Fig. 1). The station has 380-ton tanks that are used to store diesel oil for use as an energy source and fuel for transportation. Diesel oil spillages are common during tank replenishing and vehicle refuel- ing and are even caused by leaks in the storage tanks (Luz et al., 2006 ). Currently, the contaminated area is estimated to be 100 m in length around the diesel oil tanks. The distance from the sur- face to the groundwater is about 1 m. Triplicate soil samples from three different points (sA, sC and sB) showing stains and smell char- acteristic of diesel oil contamination were collected from different depths (40, 34 and 14 cm, respectively). The TPH content from these samples was measured in situ using an infrared method [InfraCal TOG/TPH analyzer, model HATR-T2 (Wilks Enterprise Inc.)], follow- ing the manufacturer’s instructions. For hydrocarbon extraction from soil samples, n-hexane was used as the solvent. Pristine soils were collected from (i) rookery area, a protected environment close to Arctowski Polish Station and next to a colony of Adelie penguins (Pygoscelis adeliae ); (ii) ipanema, an area used as a nesting site by local species of ﬂying birds; and (iii) yellow soil, which is a low-organic matter soil. Yellow soil was sampled in 2007, whereas rookery and ipanema soils were collected in 2008. Determination of TPH concentrations of the soil samples was per- formed by gas chromatography using the EPA 8015D technique Pristine and diesel oil-contaminated soils were characterized as loamy sand (Simas et al., 2008 ). The pristine soils studied were clas- siﬁed as extremely acid (yellow and rookery soils) and moderately acid (ipanema soil) soils, whereas the contaminated soils varied from neutral to slightly alkaline (data not shown).", "2.2. DNA extraction", "Total DNA was extracted directly from 0.5 g of each triplicate of soils using the Fast DNA Spin Kit for soil (QBIOgene, Carlsbad, CA) following the manufacturer’s instructions. DNA preparations were visualized by electrophoresis in a 0.8% agarose gel in 1× TBE buffer (Sambrook et al., 1989 ) to assess their integrity, and the amount of DNA was determined using the NanoDrop 1000 (Thermo Scientiﬁc, Suwanee, GA). All DNA preparations were stored at 4◦C prior to PCR ampliﬁcation.", "2.3.

Amplicons with 292 and 306 bp were expected from PAH-RHD /H9251[GP] and PAH-RHD /H9251[GN], respectively (Cébron et al., 2008 ). The 25 /H9262L of PCR reaction mix was comprised of 1 /H9262L of tem- plate DNA (30–50 ng), 0.5 pmol of primers, 0.2 mM of each dNTP, 5 /H9262L of 5× PCR buffer (100 mM Tris–HCl, pH 9.0, and 500 mM KCl), 1.5 mM MgCl 2and 1 U of Taq DNA polymerase (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). The ampliﬁcation conditions included an initial denatu- ration step of 3 min at 94◦C followed by 35 cycles of 0.7 min at 94◦C, 1 min 30 s at 54◦C or 57◦C (for PAH-RHD /H9251[GP]and PAH-RHD /H9251[GN], respectively), 0.7 min at 72◦C, and a ﬁnal step of 3 min at 72◦C. Negative controls (without DNA) were included in all ampliﬁ- cations. PCR products were separated by electrophoresis on a 1.4% agarose gel and then stained with ethidium bromide to conﬁrm the expected amplicon sizes.", "2.4. Clone libraries", "Clone libraries were constructed with amplicons generated by PCR ampliﬁcation of the RHD /H9251. PAH-RHD /H9251[GP]and PAH-RHD /H9251[GN] PCR fragments were separated by electrophoresis as described above, and bands of the expected sizes were excised from agarose gels using a sterile razor blade. At this stage, the PCR products obtained from the different replicates of each sampling site were pooled and puriﬁed using the Wizard SV Gel and PCR Clean-up System (Promega, Madison, WI, USA).", "Puriﬁed amplicons were cloned using the CloneJETTMCloning Kit (Fermentas, Maryland, USA), following the supplier’s instruc- tions. After the transformation of Escherichia coli JM109 competent cells, positive clones were screened in LB-containing plates with the addition of 0.1 mg mL−1of ampicillin. pJET primers [pJET1-2F (5/prime-CGA CTC ACT ATA GGG AGA GCG GC-3/prime) and pJET1-2R (5/prime-AAG AAC ATC GAT TTT CCA TGG CAG-3/prime)] were used to conﬁrm the length of cloned fragments. The PCR was performed directly from positive colonies with a 15 /H9262L of PCR reaction mix comprised of 0.25 pmol of primers, 0.2 mM of each dNTP, 3 /H9262L of 5× PCR buffer (100 mM Tris–HCl, pH 9.0, 500 mM KCl), 1.5 mM MgCl 2, and 1 U of Taq DNA polymerase (Promega, Madison, WI, USA).

The clones containing inserts with the expected size were then sequenced using the forward primer pJET1-2 F of the vector pJET in an ABI Prism 3100 automatic sequencer (Applied Biosystems Inc., CA, USA) using Macrogen (South Korea) facilities.", "2.5. Sequence analysis", "The electropherogram ﬁles generated by sequencing were analyzed using the Phred program (Ewing and Green, 1998 ) for base calling and trimming of vector and low-quality (<20) sequences. The partial sequences obtained were compared with the GenBank database using the algorithms BLASTN and BLASTX (http://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST ) to identify the most similar gene encoding /H9251-subunit RHDs and to conﬁrm that the sequences obtained encode for valid /H9251-subunit RHDs, respectively. Non-PAH-RHD /H9251[GP]- and PAH-RHD /H9251[GN]-encoding sequences and potential chimera sequences were eliminated. The nucleotide sequences were translated using the Transeq tool (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/emboss/transeq/ ) of the Euro- pean Bioinformatics Institute website and deduced amino acids were directly compared with the Protein Database using thealgorithm BLASTP from NCBI to identify the most similar /H9251-subunit RHD already described. Deduced amino acids sequences were also compared with two additional databases: the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG, http://www.genome.jp/kegg/ ) and The Gene Ontology (GO, http://www.geneontology.org ). Finally, PAH-RHD /H9251sequences of closely related enzymes were recov- ered from the databases and then aligned with the sequences obtained in this study using the package software Clustal X (Thompson et al., 1997 ). Phylogenetic trees were constructed using the unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean (UPGMA) (Sokal and Michener, 1958 ) with a bootstrap test (1000 replicates) (Felsenstein, 1985 ). These analyses were carried out using MEGA version 4 (Tamura et al., 2007 ).", "2.6. Statistical analyses", "Statistical analyses were performed using the MOTHUR soft- ware (Schloss et al., 2009 ). Although there is no recognized cut-off value to deﬁne operational protein family (OPF) using the /H9251-subunit RHDs sequences, we deﬁned a cutoff value of a 10% difference for the purpose of comparison among sequences. This value was cho- sen based on previous sequencing analyses using BLASTP and the clustering identiﬁcation of the phylogenetic trees. Next, the OPF- generated matrices were used to calculate the species richness using Chao1 estimators (Chao, 1987 ), the rarefaction curves and the Shannon–Weaver diversity index (Shannon and Weaver, 1949 ). Coverage (C) was also calculated, where C is expressed by 1 − n1/N in which n1/N is the ratio of clones that appeared only once (n1) to the total number of clones (N) (Chelius and Triplett, 2001 ). PAH-RHD /H9251[GP] and PAH-RHD /H9251[GN] gamma diversities of con- taminated Antarctic soil were estimated as the sum of PAH-RHD /H9251 richness from all samples. Rare and common species had the same weight (Jost, 2007 ).", "2.7. UniFrac-based library comparisons", "In order to perform UniFrac-based library comparisons (Lozupone et al., 2007 ), deduced amino acid alignment, distance matrices and neighborhood-joining trees were constructed using PHYLIP suite of programs version 3.6 (Felsenstein, 2005 ). We used unweighted UniFrac Signiﬁcance analysis to estimate whether the clone libraries corresponding to each soil are signiﬁcantly different. One hundred permutations were performed and the P-values were corrected for multiple comparisons using the Bonferroni correction", "2.8.

Therefore, proﬁling analysis of functional microbial communities has assumed spe- cial relevance as it allows understanding of how ecosystems are structured for bioremediation implementation.", "In this study, using culture-independent methods based on PCR-cloning-sequencing analysis of the RHD /H9251, the presence of PAH- RHD /H9251related to PAH-dioxygenases described in Gram-negative Alphaproteobacteria (Sphingomonas ), Betaproteobacteria (Acidovo- rax, Burkholderia , Comamonas , Polaromonas and Ralstonia ) and Gammaproteobacteria (Pseudomonas ) was observed. PAH-RHD /H9251 related to PAH-dioxygenases described in high-G+C Gram-positive bacteria (Mycobacterium , Nocardioides and Rhodococcus ) and Fir- micutes (Bacillus ) were also found in the Antarctic soils studied. Numerous PAH-RHD /H9251sequences found in contaminated soil libraries showed only low similarity to sequences deposited in databases (BLASTN, BLASTP, KEGG and GO); therefore, novel dioxy- genases not described so far could have been found. Moreover, PAH-RHD /H9251sequences from Gram-positive and Gram-negative bac- teria were found in all contaminated soil samples, but only three sequences related to Gram-negative PAH-RHD /H9251were observed in pristine soils, suggesting that the detection of PAH-RHD /H9251-coding genes was affected by the presence of diesel oil contamination in soils. We also hypothesize that the PAH-degrading bacteria in Table 4 Statistical comparisons of PAH-RHD /H9251libraries.", "Soil sample Unweighted-UniFrac* Gram negative PAH-RHD /H9251libraries (PAH-RHD /H9251[GN]) sA sA sC Gram-positive PAH-RHD /H9251libraries (PAH-RHD /H9251[GP]) sA sA sC *Reference values for UniFrac signiﬁcance analyses of libraries differences: Highly signiﬁcant suggestive (0.05–0.1); not signiﬁcant (>0.1).non-contaminated sites are present in a very low number, which is probably under the detection limit of the technique used. Likewise, Ma et al. (2006) also failed to isolate PAH-degrading bacteria from Antarctic unpolluted sites.", "PAH-RHD /H9251[GN]-coding clones associated with “classical nah- like” dioxygenases were found in all libraries obtained from diesel oil-contaminated soils and comprised 95.2% of the PAH-RHD /H9251[GN]B library, emphasizing the importance of the genus Pseudomonas in Antarctic soils. Moreover, sequences sharing 52–62% identity with ArhAc from the acenaphthene and acenaphthylene degrader Sphingomonas sp. A4 (Kouzuma et al., 2006 ) were found in the PAH-RHD /H9251[GN]libraries. These sequences correspond to 69.0% and 89.6% of positive clones from PAH-RHD /H9251[GN]A and C, respectively (Figs. 2 and 4A). Although it is difﬁcult to correlate with certainty the presence of these sequences with PAH-degrading Sphin- gomonas because of the low identity obtained between the enzyme sequences, different species of this genus have been described as playing an important role in oxidation of low-molecular-weight PAH and also oxidizing large aromatic hydrocarbons, such as benzo[ a]pyrene, benzo[ a]anthracene and chrysene (Jakoncic et al., PAH-RHD /H9251[GN]related to NagAc from P. naphthalenivorans CJ2, and PhnAc from Acidovorax sp. NA3 and Burkholderia sp. Eh1-1 was found in sA soil. The dioxygenase NagAc ﬁrst described in P. naphthalenivorans CJ2, a strain able to grow in temperatures as low as 4◦C, catalyzes the ﬁrst step of naphthalene degradation (Jeon et al., 2006 ). Tittabutr et al. (2011) also showed that an analogue of NagAc found in Burkholderia sp. C3 could oxidize phenanthrene and organosulfur dibenzothiophene. Moreover, PhnAc from Acidovorax sp. NA3 and Burkholderia sp. Eh1-1 may be important to phenan- threne degradation because both strains have been isolated from phenanthrene-enriched soil (Singleton et al., 2009; Vacca et al., The role of Gram-positive bacteria in PAH-degradation in Antarctic environments has never been fully described, although high G+C Gram-positive bacteria from the genus Rhodococcus have been recognized as important psychrotolerant degraders of aliphatic hydrocarbons (Panicker et al., 2010 ). Actually, different studies suggest that Gram-positive bacteria may be more important D. Jurelevicius et al. / Applied Soil Ecology 55 (2012) 1– 9 7 Fig. 4.

OPF identities with previously described PAH-RHD /H9251sequences from bacterial isolates are given in Table 3. in the environmental biodegradation of high-molecular-weight PAH than Gram-negative bacteria (Kweon et al., 2010; Cerniglia, 2003 ). In this study, NidA3-like sequences from Mycobacterium species were the most abundant OPFs found in PAH-RHD /H9251[GP] libraries (Fig. 4B, Table 3). NidA3 from Mycobacterium has been correlated to the transformation of a wide range of aromatic hydrocarbon compounds, such as biphenyl, naphthalene, phenan- threne, anthracene, ﬂuoranthene, pyrene, benz[ a]anthracene and benzo[ a]pyrene (Kweon et al., 2010 ). Sequences associated with NarA from R. opacus (a naphthalene-degrading strain, Kimura et al., 2006 ) and with PhdAc from marine Nocardioides sp. Kp7 (a phenanthrene-degrading strain, Saito et al., 2000 ) were also found in the PAH-RHD /H9251[GP]C libraries. Therefore, the presence of Gram-positive bacteria able to degrade different PAH compounds in Antarctic soils could represent an important tool for bioremedia- tion processes. In addition, low-related sequences sharing 43–44% of identity with homogentisate 1,2-dioxygenase (HgmA) from B. brevis corresponded to 42.9% of the PAH-RHD /H9251[GP]A library. Again, although we are aware of the low identity of the sequences, the hgmA gene may be important since it codes for an aromatic-ring dioxygenase linked to tyrosine metabolisms known to participatein many aromatic xenobiotics biodegradation pathways, such as ethyl benzene degradation (Bestetti et al., 1984 ). Nevertheless, fur- ther studies are needed to prove the PAH-RHD gene expression in Antarctic soils.", "Microbial populations found in Antarctic hydrocarbon- contaminated soils have been already considered to be very diverse and evenly distributed (Powell et al., 2005 ). An uneven distribu- tion of PAH-RHD /H9251was observed among diesel oil-contaminated soils, as shown in Figs. 2–4A and B. For instance, the ArhAc-like sequences found in the PAH-RHD /H9251[GN]A library seem to be different from the ArhAc-like sequences found in the PAH-RHD /H9251[GN]B and C libraries (Fig. 2). Moreover, NarA-like and PhdA-like dioxygenases sequences from Gram-positive bacteria were only found in the PAH-RHD /H9251[GP]C library (Figs. 3 and 4B). We have also compared the OPF composition of the PAH-RHD /H9251[GP]and PAH-RHD /H9251[GN]libraries to prove statistically the irregular distribution of PAH-degrading bacteria among diesel oil-contaminated soils. UniFrac analysis showed that PAH-RHD /H9251-coding gene from Gram-negative bacte- ria was unevenly distributed in the contaminated soils studied (Table 4). This kind of distribution may indicate that Gram-negative PAH-degrading bacteria are inﬂuenced by the TPH concentration 8 D. Jurelevicius et al. / Applied Soil Ecology 55 (2012) 1– 9 and the depth of samples. On the other hand, beta-diversity comparisons could not differentiate the PAH-RHD /H9251[GP]B library from PAH-RHD /H9251[GP]C library. This result could be explained by the predominance of NidA3-like sequences in both PAH-RHD /H9251[GP] libraries. However, we believe that further analyses using a higher number of soil samples are necessary to understand the behavior of Gram-positive and -negative PAH-degrading bacteria in relation to TPH content in King George Island’s soils.", "5. Conclusion", "The identiﬁcation of the bacteria and genes responsible for catalyzing biogeochemical reactions is one of the major goals of microbial ecology. However, the enzymes characterized so far from the isolated bacterial strains represent a small fraction of the total biochemical diversity found in complex environments. In this study, the presence of previously described and potential novel PAH-RHD /H9251coding genes from Gram-positive and -negative bacteria in contaminated soils from King George Island, Antarctic Peninsula, were revealed. To biotechnologically apply the PAH- degrading diversity described here, we believe that traditional culturing approaches followed by in vitro studies are still necessary. The PAH-RHD /H9251coding genes detected in the diesel-contaminated soil samples studied should be used to drive the isolation of PAH- degrading microorganisms for the development of an efﬁcient bioremediation strategy in Antarctic soils.", "Acknowledgments This study was supported by grants from the National Research Council of Brazil (CNPq), FAPERJ and received ﬁnancial and logistic support from the Brazilian Antarctic Program, PROANTAR, as part of the IPY Activity no. 403 ‘MIDIAPI Microbial Diversity of Terrestrial and Maritime ecosystems in Antarctic Peninsula’ (520194/2006-3).

DISCUSSÃO", "Bactérias capazes de degradar hidrocarbonetos do petróleo são consideradas promissoras para a sua utilização em processos de biorremediação de ambientes contaminados. Entretanto, p ara a aplicação da biorremediação in situ o conhecimento de determinados fatores relacionados à distribuição dessas bactérias no ambiente são imprescindíveis . Por exemplo, o fator mais importante para a aplicação da biorremediação é o conhecimento prévio do potencial catabólico para a degra dação do composto de interesse n a comunidade alóctone do ambiente contaminado (ALVAREZ et al., 2011) . Embora diferentes bactérias degrad adoras de hidrocarbonetos do petróleo já tenham sido isoladas e identificadas em diferentes em solos da Antártica, como bactérias dos gêneros Pseudomonas , Sphingomonas , Rhodococcus , entre outras ( LUZ et al., 2006 ; AISLABIE et al., 2004 ; MA, WANG & SHAO, 20 06; PANICKER et al., 2010 ), a distribuição dessas bactérias diretamente em ecossistemas da Antártica ainda é pouco conhecida. No presente estudo, com o objetivo de estudar apenas a comunidade bacteriana de interesse , a nossa opção de análise foi de utilizar genes funcionais como ferramentas para o biomonitoramento de comunidades bacterianas com capacidade de degradar diferentes hidrocarbonetos do petróleo em diferentes solos da Ilha do Rei George, Antártica . Esse método de análise, utilizad o também em diferentes estudos (KUHN, BELLICANTA & PELLIZARI, 2009; WAN G, WANG & SHAO, 2010 ), nos permitiu monitorar diretamente as comunidades bacterianas degradadoras de hidrocarbonetos alifáticos e aromáticos , que são os compostos majoritários dos combustíveis utilizados para geração de energia na Antártica , presente s em solos contaminados e não contaminados da Ilha do Rei George .", "Nossos resultados mostraram que o gene alkB, presente em bactérias que possuem a capacidade de crescer utilizando alcanos como fonte de carbono, foi detectado por PCR tanto em solos contaminados como nos solos não contaminados da Antártica , independente do pH e de outros fatores físico -químicos dos solos estudados . Em estudos anteriores, através de métodos de cultivo e de técnicas de PCR - hibridização, a presença de bactérias degradadoras de alcanos não foi detectada em solos não contaminados e esse fato foi justificado pela baixa concentração dessas bactérias nos solos estudados (LUZ et al., 2006 ; WHYTE et al., 2002; AISLABIE et al., 2004) . Embora a presença de bactérias degradadoras de alcanos já tenha sido também correlacionada positivamente com a abundância de matéria orgânica encontrada em solos ornitogênicos da Antártica ( DELILLE, COULON, & PELLETIER , 2004 , AISLABIE, RYBURN & SARMAH, 2008 ), nossos estudos revelaram a presença de genes alkB mesmo em solos com baixas concentrações de matéria orgânica.", "Por outro lado, o potencial catabólico da deg radação de hidrocarbonetos aromáticos foi encontrado majorita riamente nos solos contaminados aqui estudados . Apenas em um solo não contaminado foi detectada a presença de genes PAH -RHDα de bactérias Gram -negativas. Acreditamos, portanto, que a s bactérias G ram-positivas e Gram -negativas que possuem os genes PAH -RHDα sejam enriquecidas pela presença de hidrocarbonetos do petróleo nos solos contaminados, enquanto que nos solos não contaminados essas bactérias estejam presentes em baixos números e /ou possivelmente abaixo do limite de detecção do método utilizado. Do mesmo modo, através de métodos dependentes de cultivo, MA e colaboradores (2006) não conseguiram isolar nenhuma estirpe bacteriana capaz de degradar HPA de solos não contaminados da Antárti ca. Já FLOCCO e colaboradores (2009), utilizando métodos independentes de cultivo de bactérias, também não detectar am a presença de potencial catabólico para degradação de HPA, especificamente de bactérias Gram -negativas, em diferentes solos não contaminad os da Antártica.", "Em nosso estudo buscamos identificar os genes que codificam para enzimas relacionadas com a degradação de hidrocarbonetos do petróleo em diferentes solos da Ilha do Rei George . Em todos os casos, foram identificados diferentes filotipos d e genes relacionados com a degradação de hidrocarbonetos do petróleo nos solos analisados. A identificação molecular através do sequenciamento de DNA dos genes alkB detectados nos solos da Ilha do Rei George mostrou que a maioria d as sequências obtidas eram relacionada s com genes alkB previamente identificados em bactérias Gram -positivas dos gêneros Rhodococcus , Mycobacterium , Aeromicrobium , Nocardia e Gordonia . Esses resultados corroboram os resultados obtidos por W HYTE et al. (2002) e por L UZ et al. (2004) que sugeriram que genes alkB relacionados ao de bactérias do gênero Rhodococcus são mais prevalentes nos solos da Antártica do que genes alkB de bactérias Gram -negativas do gênero Pseudomonas .", "Considerando os genes relacionados à degradação de hidro carbonetos aromáticos (PAH -RHD α), a análise das sequências obtidas em nosso trabalho mostrou a presença de PAH -RHDα relacionadas com dioxigenases NagAc descritas em Ralstonia sp. U2 e com dioxigenase s NahAc descritas em Comamonas testosteroni H em um solo não contaminado. Nos solos contaminados , a análise das sequências obtidas mostrou a presença de genes relacionados com genes PAH -RHD α descritos em bactérias Gram -negativas dos gêneros Sphingomonas (ArhA) , Acidovorax (PhnA) , Burkholderia (PhnA) , Comamonas , Polaromonas (NagA) e Pseudomonas (NahA) , e em bactérias Gram -positivas dos gêneros Mycobacterium (NidA1) , Nocardioides (PhdA), Terrabacter (PdoA) , Rhodococcus (NarA) e Bacillus (HgmA) . As diferentes famílias de PAH-RHDα aqui detectadas nos solos contaminados da Antártica representam um grande potencial catabólico para a degradação de uma ampla variedade de HPA. Genes PAH-RHDα que codificam enzimas relacionadas com a dioxigenase NahAc de Pseudomonas , ArhAc de Sphingomonas e NidA de Mycobacterium são geralmente detectados em estirpes, pertencentes a os gêneros correspondentes , capazes de degradar HPA tanto de baixo quanto d e alto peso molecular , como naftaleno, fenantreno e antraceno (KOUZUMA et al., 2006; JAKO NCIC et al., 2007; FLOCCO et al., 2009) . É importante ressaltar que, até a data da finalização de nosso estudo, o potencial catabólico da degradação de HPA por bactérias Gram -positivas não havia sido descrito em solos da Antártica. Muitos estudos sugerem que as bactérias Gram -positivas degradadoras de HPA sejam mais importantes do que as bactérias Gram -negativas para a degradação de hidrocarbonetos aromáticos de alto peso molecular (CERNIGLIA, 2003; KWEON et al . 2010). Além disso, bactérias Gram -positivas podem s er mais resistentes às severas condições ambientais dos solos da Antártica do que as bactérias Gram -negativas . ERIKSSON, KA & MOHN, (2001 ) mostraram que bactérias do gênero Rhodococcus são capazes de resistir a ciclos de congelamento e descongelamento , ciclos estes que geralmente ocorrem em solos da Antártica .", "Foi também observada em nosso estudo a presença de genes pouco relacionados (42-80%) com genes alkB e PAH-RHDα anteriormente descritos em bactérias isoladas de solos antárticos ou detectados por métodos independentes de cultivo em microrganismos de outros ambientes. Para confirmar se esses genes codificavam realmente parte de enzimas funcionais, as sequências de DNA obtidas foram traduzidas para a obtenção d as sequências deduzidas de aminoácidos codificados por esses genes. As sequências deduzidas de aminoácidos obtidas foram posteriormente analisadas utilizando -se diferentes ferramentas para análises de genes funcionais, observando -se assim a poss ível atividade dessas enzimas na degradação de hidrocarbonetos do petróleo.", "Embora muitas enzimas de degradação de hidrocarbonetos de petróleo já tenham sido descritas em diferentes espécies de bactérias (como revisto no ARTIGO 1), acredita -se que as oxigenases já caracterizadas em estirpes bacterianas representem somente uma pequena fração da diversidade dessas enzimas presentes em ambientes naturais ( KUHN, BELLICANTA & PELLIZARI, 2009 ; WASMUND et al., 2009) . Nossos resultados indicam que os solos da Antártica podem ser fontes de nov as vias metabólic as para a degradação de diferentes hidrocarbonetos do petróleo. A identificação desses genes nos solos da Antártica permitirá, em etapas futuras, direcionar estratégias de cultivo de microrganismos para se isolar as bactérias que possuem os genes detectados n o presente trabalho . O isolamento dessas bactéria s é essencial para a caracterização dess as nov as vias metabólic as de degradação de hidrocarbonetos alifáticos e aromáticos do petróleo. Além disso, o isolamento dessas bactérias é primordial caso sejam consideradas estratégias de bioaumento para o aprimoramento da biorremediação em solo s antárticos .", "Além do relatado acima , como existe uma diferença nos perfis físico -químicos dos diferentes solos antárticos estudados ( ex: considerando somente o pH , os solos variavam de extremamente ácidos a neutros), isolar bactérias adaptadas às características do solo é importante para a aplicação do bioaumento nos diferentes solos da Antártica . Um dos principais fatores limitantes do bioaumento é que as bactérias introduzidas no s solos contaminados precisam sobreviver nas condições físico -químicas do solo em questão (A LVAREZ et al., 2011). Visto isso , a última etapa de nosso estudo foi a caracterização d a distribuição dessas bactérias nos diferentes solos estudados da Ilha do Rei George . Como relatado anteriormente, genes PAH- RHDα de bactérias Gram -positivas e Gram -negativas foram principalmente detectados em solos contaminados com hidrocarbonetos do petróleo, e somente em um solo não contaminado foram detectadas sequ ências relacionadas com PAH-RHDα de bactérias Gram -negativas . Esses resultados sugerem que a presença dos hidrocarbonetos levam ao aumento de bactérias degradadoras de HPA, como descrito anteriormente por FLOCCO et al. (2009). Porém , a análise da distribuição dos genes PAH-RHDα nos solos contaminados com TPH mostrou que a concentração desses contaminantes nos solos também pode influenciar a distribuição da comunidade de bactérias degradadora de HPA. Quando foram realizadas as a nálises da diversidade beta das sequências obtidas nas diferentes bibliotecas de genes PAH-RHDα construídas no presente estudo, utilizando -se o teste métrico UniFrac, o s resultados mostraram que os genes PAH- RHDα de bactérias Gram -negativas são distribuídos de for ma heterogênea nos solos contaminados da Antártica. Esse tipo de distribuição pode indicar que bactérias Gram - negativas degradadoras de HPA nesses solos sejam influenciadas pela concentração de TPH nos solos. Por outro lado, a análise de UniFrac das bibliotecas dos genes PAH - RHDα de bactérias Gram -positivas mostrou que a comunidade de bactérias Gram - positivas degradadoras de HPA são mais homogêneas nos solos contaminados do que a comunidade de bactérias Gram -negativas. Estudos a nteriores já haviam classificado a distribuição da comunidade microbiana de solos contaminados da Antártica como heterogênea (POWELL et al., 2005).", "Considerando a distribuição de bactérias com potencial catabólico para a degradação de alcanos, os resultad os obtidos mostrara m que cada solo estudado apresentou uma comunidade particular dessas bactérias. Dois métodos baseados no polimorfismo do DNA foram utilizados, o PCR -RFLP e o PCR -DGGE , com o objetivo de aumentar a confiabilidade do s resultado s. Em ambos os casos, os dendrogramas gerados pela análise dos perfis de bandas obtidos tanto pelo PCR -RFLP e PCR -DGGE de cada solo mostraram a separação das amostras de acordo com suas características físico -químicas. Sendo assim , dois grandes grupos foram formados n os dendrogramas : um grupo contendo as amostras dos solos contaminados e outro grupo com as amostras dos solos n ão contaminados . Neste último grupo, três subgrupos foram formados correspondendo a cada tipo de solo não contaminado estudado. Essa mesma separação das amostras foi observada quando os dados do PCR -RFLP e do PCR - DGGE foram analisados através da Análise de Correspondência Canônica (CCA). Como em e studos anteriores havia sido demonstrado que o pH pode ser considerado o principal fator que influencia a distribuição de comunidades bacterianas em diferentes solos ( FIERER & JACKSON, 2006; LAUBER et al., 2009 ) e que o TPH também pode ter um papel importante nessa distribuição (SAUL et al., 2005; PAISSE et al., 2008; POWELL et al., 2010 ), realizamos a análise de partição da variância com base nos dados gerados pelas análises de CCA dos perfis do DGGE para estimar a contribuição de cada fator físico -químico dos solos estudados na distribuição da comunidade bacteriana com potencial para degradar alcano s. Os resultados obtidos mostraram quem nem o pH e nem o TPH sozinhos são os responsáveis pela distribuição de bactérias degradadoras de alcanos nos solos contaminados e não contaminados da Antártica . Esses dois fatores contribuíram juntos com 30% da varia ção observada, enquanto individualmente o pH contribuiu com 15,4% e o TPH com 14,1%. A hipótese mais plausível para explicar a distribuição de bactérias degradadoras de alcanos nos solos estudados da Antártica é que a combinação de todas as características observadas nos solos estudados influencia de alguma maneira a distribuição dessas comunidades, já que as outras variáveis estudadas, como matéria orgânica, Fe, K, S, também contribuíram com 27,5% da distribuição observada da comunidade bacteriana degradado ra de alcanos.", "10. CONCLUSÃO", " Os resultados obtidos nesse estudo descrevem o potencial catabólico da degradação de hidrocarbonetos do petróleo pelas comunidades bacterianas presentes em diferentes solos da Ilha do Rei George, na Antártica.  Os resultados m ostram, através da análise por PCR -DGGE, PCR -RFLP e da construção de biblioteca de clones , que mesmo os solos não contaminados da Antártica possuem uma grande diversidade de genes que codificam monoxigenases envolvidas na degradação de hidrocarbonetos alif áticos (alcanos).  A presença de genes relacionados à degradação bacteriana de hidrocarbonetos poliaromáticos (HPA) foi prevalentemente detectada nos solos previamente contaminados com hidrocarbonetos do petróleo .", " Nesses solos foram detectad as, através da construção de bibliotecas de clones , sequências relacionadas com dioxigenases de bactérias Gram -negativas pertencentes aos gêneros Sphingomonas (ArhA), Acidovorax (PhnA), Burkholderia (PhnA), Polaromonas (NagA), e Pseudomonas (NahA), e de bactérias Gram - positivas dos gêneros Mycobacterium (NidA1), Nocardioides (PhdA), Terrabacter (PdoA), Rhodococcus (NarA) e Bacillus (HgmA) .", " Os resultados mostraram que bactérias com potencial de degradação de hidrocarbonetos do petróleo não são distribuídas uniformemente nos solos da Antártica estudados.", " A distribuição dessas bactérias nos solos da Antártica pode ser influenciada por diferentes fatores: (i) a presença do TPH leva ao aumento de bactérias degradadoras de HPA; (ii) em solos contami nados com TPH, a quantidade do contaminante influencia a distribuição de bactérias degradadoras de HPA e de alcanos; (iii) considerando solos contaminados e não contaminados, cada solo (com características físico -químicas próprias) leva à seleção de uma comunidade bacteriana degradadora de alcanos em particular; e (iv) o conjunto das características físico -químicas de cada solo influencia diretamente na distribuição de bactérias degradadoras de alcanos nos solos da Antártica.", " A detecção d e genes que codificam oxigenases com baixa identidade com genes de oxigenases previamente caracterizados em estirpes bacterianas sugere a presença de novas vias metabólic as para degradação de diferentes hidrocarbonetos nos solos da Ilha do Rei George.", "11. CONSIDERAÇÕES FINAIS", "O presente estudo é parte de um esforço contínuo para a implementação da biorremediação dos solos contaminados adjacentes à antiga estação brasileira de pesquisa no continente Antártico, a Estação Comandante Ferraz. Com o incêndio que atingiu a Estação Comandante Ferraz ( em 2012) e , por conseguinte, a desativação da antiga estação de pesquisa para a construção de uma nova no mesmo local, a biorremediação do solo contaminado é uma etapa ainda mais necessária. A detecção do potencial c atabólico de microrganismos alóctones é o primeiro passo para viabilizar ou não a aplicação da biorremediação. Etapas adicionais consistem no aprimoramento das técnicas de biorremediação, como a aplicação do bioestímulo e do bioaumento , e a avaliação dos r esultados correspondentes para o processo de remediação e para o ambiente .", "Adicionalmente aos resultados obtidos nos projetos relacionados a ambientes contaminados com hidrocarbonetos do petróleo em solos da Antártica, outros projetos correlacionad os com ambientes contaminados com petróleo também foram desenvolvidos em nosso laboratório .

To study the alkB gene within 3 bacterial communities , researchers need to be aware of the variation s in alkB 4 nucleotide se quences ; a failure to consider the sequence variations results in 5 the low representation of the diversity and richness of alkane -degrading 6 bacteria. To minimize this shortcoming, the use of a combination of three alkB- 7 targeting primers to enhance the detec tion of the alkB gene in previously 8 isolated alkane -degrading bacteria was proposed. Using this approach, alkB- 9 related PCR products were detected in 79% of the strains tested. Further more , 10 the chosen set of primers was used to study alkB richness and diver sity in 11 different soils sampled in Carmópolis, Brazil and King George Island, 12 Antarctica. The DNA extracted from the different soils was PCR amplified with 13 each set of alkB-targeting primers, and clone libraries were constructed, 14 sequenced and analyzed. A total of 255 alkB phylotypes were detected. Venn 15 diagram analyses revealed that only low numbers of alkB phylotypes were 16 shared among the different libraries derived from each primer pair. Therefore, 17 the combination of three alkB-targeting primers enhanced the richness of alkB 18 phylotypes detected in the different soils by 45% to 139%, when compared to 19 the use of a single alkB-targeting primer. In addition, a dendrogram analysis 20 and beta diversity comparison of the alkB composition showed that each of the 21 sampling sites studied had a particular set of alkane -degrading bacteria. The 22 use of a combination of alkB primers was an efficient strategy for enhancing the 23 detection of the alkB gene in cultivable bacteria and for better characteriz ing the 24 distribution of alkane -degrading bacteria in different soil environments. 25", "Keywords: alkB primers; alkane -degrading bacteria; alkane monooxygenase; 2 diversity; soil environments 3 Introduction 5 Alkane -utilizing bacteria are widespread in marine and terrestrial environments 6 [1], [2]. These bacteria generally possess the Alk enzyme system, which is 7 involved in the metabolic pathway for the degradation of alkanes, the main 8 comp ounds found in petroleum and its derivatives [3]. The functional Alk 9 enzyme system comprises the transmembrane alkane monooxygenase AlkB 10 (encoded b y the alkB gene and involved in the initial activation step of aerobic 11 aliphatic hydrocarbon metabolism) and two co -factors named rubredoxin ( alkF) 12 and rubredoxin reductase ( alkG). These co -factors are responsible for 13 transferring the electrons involved in alkane hydroxylation by AlkB [4]. In other 14 studies, the alkB gene has been used as a biomarker for the determination of 15 the abundance and diversit y of alkane -degrading bacteria [5][7]. 16 Bacteria that possess the Alk enzyme system are valuable in 17 environmental bioremediation and biocatalysis for the synthesis of industrial 18 compounds, including drugs, pravastatin, and other compound s [8]. The use of 19 alkane -degrading bacteria in bioprocesses to produce valuable chemicals by 20 transforming alkanes from hydrocarbon -contaminated samples is considered 21 one of the most important biotechnological application s of these bacteria [9]. 22 Therefore, many studies report the detection and further characterization of 23 alkB genes in a wide variety of bacterial genera [4], [10], [11]. 24", "However , the alkB genes characterized thus far may only represent a 1 small fraction of the diversity found in natural environments and a limited 2 biotechnological potential of alkane -degrading bacteria . Kuhn and co -workers 3 [5] found new alkB genes when contaminated and uncontaminated marine 4 sediments in Admiralty Bay, King George Island, Antarctica were analyzed. 5 Similar results were obtained for samples from the Timor Sea in Australia [12] 6 and from chronically polluted , sub Antarctic coastal sediments [13]. 7 Although all AlkB p roteins share considerable sequence homolog y, the 8 nucleotide sequences encoding the alkB gene vary widely within the alkB- 9 containing bacteria. To overcome this limitation and study the alkB diversity in 10 natural environments, different alkB primers have been described [5], [14], [15]. 11 However, each set of primers is specific for primarily one group of bacteria 12 [15][17], and designing broad -ranging alkB primers is not an easy task. 13 Consequently, the presence and diversity of alkB sequences have likely been 14 underestimated in the environmental samples previously studied. 15 In this study, we propose to use a combination of primers, rather than 16 designing new primers, to improve the identification of the alkB diversity in 17 different environments. For this purpose , we retrieved several pairs of alkB- 18 targeting primers from the literature and tested their specificities against alkane - 19 degrading bacteria previously i solated by our research group. The se bacteria 20 are representatives of Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Flavobacteria and 21 Firmicutes groups. After selecting the combination of alkB-targeting primers 22 showing the broadest coverage among the bacterial strains te sted, we 23 constructed alkB clone libraries using an oil -contaminated semiarid soil from 24 Carmópolis, SE, Brazil to test the approach proposed here in the environment. 25", "Moreover, this strategy was also used to understand the alkB diversity in three 1 pristine so il samples and one diesel -contaminated soil sample from King 2 George Island, Antarctica. The data obtained suggest that the alkB diversity in 3 soil environments may be higher than previously described. 4 Materials and Methods 6 alkB -targeting primers 7 The list of alkB-targeting primer pairs used is presented in Table 1. The PCR 8 reactions were performed under the conditions previously described for each 9 pair of primers (Table 1). 10 Bacterial strains, test of bacterial growth using heptadecane as the sole 12 carbon source and bacterial identification 13 The bacterial strains used (Table 2) were isolated and described in previous 14 studies [18][20]. The ability of these isolated strains to use heptadecane as the 15 sole carbon source was determined as described by Alvarez et al. [19]. The 16S 16 rRNA gene sequences were used for the identification of the b acterial strains . 17 Genomic DNA was extracted using a protocol described by Pitcher et a l. [21]. 18 BOX -PCR was used to cluster the bacterial strains according to Versalovic et al. 19 [22], and one representative strain from each BOX -PCR group was selected for 20 coding gene and the molecular sequencing methodologies were performed as 22 described in Alvarez et al . [19]. The partial 16S rRNA gene seque nces (~800 23 bp) were identified using the BLAST -N tool (blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) on the 24", "National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) website using the 1 GenBank non -redundant database. 2 Selection of alkB -targeting primers 4 The alkB-targeting primers were chosen based on the combination of primers 5 that allowed for the detection of the alkB gene in as many bacterial strains 6 tested as possible. Primers were combined manually in pairs and triplets , and 7 the number of bacterial strains detected by the combi nation of primers used 8 was determined. 9 Combined use of alkB -targeting primers to study the alkB diversity in 11 different soils 12 To test the approach suggested here ( the use of a combination of alkB-targeting 13 primers) to better describe the alkB diversity in soil environments, we 14 constructed clone libraries using the chosen primers and the DNA extracted 15 from contaminated soil samples obtained in Carmópolis (denoted as sC 16 throughout the manuscript), SE, Brazil, where the majority of the bacterial 17 strains presented in Table 2 were isolated [18][20]. Further more , this strategy 18 was extended to study the alkB diversity present in diesel -contaminated soil 19 (denoted as s3) and three uncontaminated (pristine) soil samples (sY, sI and 20 sR) from King George Island, Antarctica (Fig. S1). These An tarctic soils were 21 chosen because previous studies have suggested that the soils may contain an 22 underestimated diversity of genes coding for AlkB enzymes or even new alkB 23 coding genes [20], [23]. Moreover, the soil samples were selected based on 24 their different chemical and physicochemical properties (Table 3). All samplings 25", "were performed in triplicate , and the soil samples were kept at -20°C until DNA 1 extraction. 2 DNA extraction and clone library construction 4 Total DNA was extracted directly from 0.5 g of soil using the Fast DNA Spin Kit 5 for soil (QBIOgene, Carlsbad, CA) following the manufacturer’s instructions . To 6 improve the coverage of the results obtained here, DNA extraction s and PCR 7 reaction s were performed in triplicate for each sampling site . 8 To const ruct the clone libraries , the fragments of the alkB gene were 9 PCR amplified using DNA from the soils described above and with the primers 10 (f), (e) and (d) described by Chénier et al. [24], Kloos et al. [14] and Kuhn et al. 11 [5], respectively (Table 1). PCR amplification followed the conditions previously 12 described for each pair of primers (Table 1), and the 25 µl -PCR rea ction mix 13 comprised 1 µl of template DNA (30 –50 ng), 0.5 pmol of primers, 0.2 mM of 14 each dNTP, 5 µl of 5X PCR buffer (100 mM Tris -HCl, pH 9.0, and 500 mM KCl), 15 The PCR amplification pr oducts were used to construct the clone 17 libraries. Before cloning procedures, the PCR products obtained from the 18 different triplicates of each sampling site were pooled and purified using the 19 Wizard SV Gel and PCR Clean -up System (Promega). Purified amplic ons were 20 then cloned using the InsTAclone PCR Cloning Kit (Fermentas, Maryland, USA) 21 following the supplier’s instructions. The insert -containing clones were 22 sequenced using the forward primer M13F (5´ -GTA AAA CGA CGG CCA GT - 23 3´) in the vector pTZ57R/T on an ABI Prism 3100 automatic sequencer (Applied 24 Biosystems Inc., CA, USA) using Macrogen (South Korea) facilities. 25", "Sequence analysis 2 The electropherogram files generated by sequencing were analyzed using the 3 Phred program [25] for base calling and trimming of vector and low -quality (<20) 4 sequences. Vector contamination and primer sequences were removed 5 manually using Bioedit software (Ibis Biosciences Inc., CA, USA). To analyze 6 only the overlapp ing fragments of the alkB gene amplified from all pairs of 7 primer used, the o btained sequences were aligned using the package software 8 Clustal X [26] and edited using Bioedit. Only the overlapping regions of alkB 9 fragments were used in the following steps. The MOTHUR software [27] was 10 used to classify the alkB genes into operational taxonomic units (OTUs ) with 11 97% similarity. Next, the OTU -generated matrices were used to calculate the 12 species richness using Chao1 estimators [28] and the Shannon -Weav er 13 diversity index [29]. Coverage (C) was also calculated, where C equals 1−n1/N, 14 and n1/N is the ratio of clones that appeared only once ( n1) to t he total number 15 of clones (N) [30]. Boneh’s estimator was used to estimate the number of 16 additional OTUs that would be observed if an additional sa mpling of clones 17 would have been performed [31]. Finally, the diversity of OTUs and those found 18 in common after the amplification with the differen t primers used were examined 19 using rarefaction analysis and Venn diagram s. 20 Richness of alkB phylotypes 22 The increase in alkB richness as a result of the use of the combination of alkB- 23 targeting primers was calculated based on Venn diagram results . The 24 calculation was performed as follows: (lR1+lR2)/hR, where the hR corresponds 25", "to the richness of alkB phylotypes detected only in the richest clone library , and 1 (lR1 + lR2) represent s the sum of the richness of alkB phylotypes observed in 2 the other librarie s (but not in hR). 3 Phylogenetic analyses of alkB phylotypes 5 The representatives of each OTU (at a distance level of 3%) obtained from the 6 analyses of the clone libraries were taxonomic ally assigned using the BLAST -n 7 tool on the NCBI website and the GenBank non -redundant database. A 8 phylogenetic tree was constructed with representatives of each OTU found 9 within the libraries and with closely related sequences that were recovered from 10 the GenBank database. Sequence alignment was performed by Clustal X 11 software [26], and the aligned sequences were then used to construct the 12 phylogenetic tree using the neighbor -joining method in the MEGA 5 software 13 [32]. Bootstrap analyses were performed with 1,000 repetitions, and only values 14 higher than 99% are shown in the phylogenetic tree . 15 The nucleotide sequences were translated using the Transeq tool 16 (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/emboss/transeq/) on the European Bioinformatics 17 Institute website , and deduced amino acids were directly compared with the 18 Protein Database using the algorithm BL ASTP from NCBI to check if the 19 sequenced alkB genes possess the conserved motifs common to AlkB proteins. 20 Clone library comparisons 22 The structure of the alkB phylotypes in each library was compared. For the 23 comparison , a dendrogram describing the dissimi larity (1 -similarity) among the 24 clone libraries from each sampling site was clustered using the UPGMA 25", "algorithm and the Jaccard similarity coefficient based on the observed richness. 1 To perform UniFrac -based library comparisons [33], neighborhood -joining trees 2 were constructed using the MEGA 5 software [32]. An unweighted UniFrac 3 significance test was used to estimate whether the clone libraries corresponding 4 to each soil sample were significantly different. One hundred permutations were 5 performed, and the P -values were corrected for multiple comparisons using the 6 Bonferroni correction [34]. 7 Nucleotide sequence accession numbers 9 The sequences obtained from the clone libraries were deposited in the 10 GenBank database with the following accession numbers: 11 Results 13 Growth and identification of the bacterial strains using heptade cane as 14 the sole carbon source 15 From 85 oil -degrading bacteria previously described in von der Weid et al. [18], 16 Alvarez et al. [19] and Jurelevicius et al. [20], 64 were able to use heptadecane 17 as the sole carbon source (an example is shown in Fig. S2). BOX -PCR 18 clustered these bacteria into 43 different groups (data not shown), and a 19 representative strain of each BOX group was further identified through 16S 20 rRNA gene sequencing (Table 2). The results showed that the bacterial strains 21 are distributed amongst Actinomycetales, Firmicutes, Flavobacteria and Alpha, 22 Beta and Gamma proteobacteria (Table 2). 23 Selection of the alkB -targeting primers 25", "The amplification range of eight different alkB-targeting primers previously 1 described (Table 1) was determined by direct PCR amplification using the DNA 2 of the alkane -degrading bacterial strains listed in Table 2. The use of each 3 primer pair resulted in diffe rent amplification patterns. Using primers (a), (b), (c) 4 and (g), only 18.6 to 20.9% of the bacterial strains tested were amplified. The 5 broadest range of amplification (48.8% of the strains tested) was observed with 6 primer pair (e), and primers (h) and (f ) produced amplification products in 44.2% 7 of the strains tested (Table 2). Primer pair (d) resulted in the amplification of the 8 alkB gene in 23.3% of the strains tested, and most of these strains were 9 identified as Acinetobacter (Table 2). However, the re sults showed that none of 10 the primers used were highly specific to one particular phylogenetic group. PCR 11 amplification also varied among strains from the same species, depending on 12 the set of primers used (Table 2). Finally, the alkB gene was not detected in 7 13 (16.3%) of the alkane -degrading bacterial strains tested. The se strains belong 14 to the genera Cupriavidus , Bacillus , Gordonia , Bosea and Rhizobium (Table 2). 15 To enhance the detection of the alkB gene in previously isolated 16 alkane -degrading bacteria, the alkB-targeting primers were combined into pairs 17 (28 combinations) or triplets (56 combinations). The combination of primers 18 selected allowed for the detection of the alkB gene in as many bacterial strains 19 tested as possible. Therefore, primers (d), (e) and (f) were chosen as they 20 covered 79% of the alkane -degrading bacterial strains tested. The addition of a 21 fourth pair of primers did not improve the detection range achiev ed with the use 22 of the three set s of primers. 23", "Validation of the use of the selected alkB -targeting primers to study the 1 alkB diversity in soil DNA samples 2 The three selected alkB-targeting primers were used to amplify alkB genes 3 present in an oil -contamin ated soil sample from Carmópolis, SE, Brazil, which 4 was the source of the majority of the strains tested. Additionally , the same 5 strategy was used to amplify alkB genes in one diesel -contaminated site and 6 three pristine soil sample s from King George Island , Antarctica. alkB genes 7 were detected in all sampling sites, except for site sY when primer pair (d) was 8 used. 9 Clone libraries were used to describe the alkB phylotypes that resulted 10 from the amplification by each pair of primers. Only the overlapping regions of 11 alkB fragments amplified by the primers chosen were selected and used. The 12 alkB genes were clustered into OTU groups ( referred to as alkB phylotypes) 13 that were defined as sequences with more than 97% similarity. Rarefaction 14 curves, coverage, Boneh ’s estimator, Shannon -Weaver and Chao1 diversity 15 indices based on the number and frequency of OTUs were further estimated 16 (Table 4). Rarefaction curves indicated that the number of clones screened from 17 all soil samples was sufficient to reveal the majority of alkB phylotypes within 18 the community because the estimates of sequence types tended to reach a 19 plateau using 97% sequence identity (Fig. 1). The data obtained from the 20 statistical analyses showed that the clone libraries covered 65 to 95% of the 21 alkB phylotypes that resulted from the PCR amplification using each pair of 22 primers and the different soil samples (Table 4). Boneh ’s estimator showed that 23 a new sequencing effort would increase the alkB phylotypes to a maximum of 24 nine new alkB phylotypes (Table 4). Considering the results obtained from the 25", "sC sample , the highest richness and diversity of alkB phylotypes were detected 1 by using primer pair (e) (Table 4). Considering the soil sampling sites s3 and sR 2 from King George Island, the results also showed that the highest richness of 3 alkB phylotypes was observed in the clone libraries constructed with PCR 4 amplification products obtained using primer pair (e), followed by the use of (f) 5 and (d) (Table 4). In the sampling site sI, the highest richness was obs erved in 6 the clone libraries constructed with PCR amplification products obtained with 7 the use of primer (d), followed by those from primers (f) and (e) ; the highest 8 richness of alkB phylotypes in sampling site sY was observed with the use of 9 primer pair ( f) (Table 4). 10 Improved detection of the richness of alkB phylotypes 12 Chao richness -based Venn diagrams showed the shared presence of alkB 13 phylotypes detected by each alkB-targeting primer and from each sampling site 14 (Fig. 2). The results showed that the clone libraries generated by each primer 15 pair shared low numbers of common alkB phylotypes (Fig. 2). Subsequently , 16 the results from the Venn diagrams were used to calculate the gain in alkB 17 phylotype richness by using the combined alkB-targeting primer strategy. The 18 use of this strategy to describe the alkB diversity in sC soil resulted in a 47% 19 increase in alkB richness (Fig. 2, Fig. S3). The same strategy used to study the 20 alkB diversity in soils from King George Island, Antarctica , resulted in an 21 increase of 45 to 139% in alkB richness (Fig. 2, Fig. S3). 22 Phylogenetic analyses of alkB genes 24", "A total of 254 OTUs ( referred to as alkB phylotypes) were obtained in this study. 1 The phylogenetic analyses of the alkB phylotypes showed the detection of 2 sequences sharing 64 to 100% identit y with alkB sequences previously 3 deposited in GenBank. However, from the 254 alkB phylotypes detected here , 4 only 20% of the sequences showed identities 90% or higher with known 5 sequences (35% of the sequences shared identities of 80% or lower with known 6 sequences). Nucleotide translating analysis followed by deduced amino acid 7 analysis using BLAST -P tools showed that only one alkB phylotype obtained did 8 not encode a potentially functional AlkB. A stop codon was detected in the 9 nucleotide sequence of this phylotype , and consequently this phylotype was 10 excluded from further analyses. All other alkB phylotypes had conserved amino 11 acid motifs found in functional AlkB enzymes. 12 Phylogenetic analyses of the alkB phylotypes showed that each of the 13 alkB-targeting primers chosen was not specific to any monophyletic group of 14 alkB gene s because the primers were able to anneal to alkB gene sequences 15 from diverse phylogenetic groups (Fig. 3A, B). In sampling site sC, the most 16 representative alkB phylotypes ( corresponding to 30% and 13.4% of the clone 17 libraries) were related to alkB from Mycobacterium c hubuense NBB4 (with 92% 18 sequence identity) and to alkB from Acidisphaera sp. C197 (81% identity) , 19 respectively . 20 From the diesel -contaminated soil (s3) sampled in King George Island , 21 the most abundant alkB phylotypes (29.7%) shared high identity (99%) with the 22 alkB gene described in Rhodococcus sp. 28/19, an oil -degrading strain 23 previously isolated from soils in Antarctica. Other alkB phylotypes obtained from 24 the s3 sampling site were related to an alkB gene from non -cultivated bacteria 25", "detected in Arctic contaminated soils (99% identity) and to alkB described in a 1 strain from the Acetobacteraceae family (89% identity). These alkB phylotypes 2 correspond to 14.8% and 12.9% of the s3 clone library, respectively (Fig. 3A). 3 From the uncontaminated soils sampled in King George Island, most of 4 the alkB phylotypes detected at sampling site sY ( corresponding to 73.1% of the 5 clones) were related to an alkB gene described in Pedobacter sp. MS245e (78 6 to 85% identity). Additionally , phylotypes related to alkB from Bacillus sp. 7 MS238f (88% identity) corresponded to 23.3% of the sY clone library. In 8 sampling site sI, the most abundant alkB phylotype (20.7%) shared 87% identity 9 with alkB described in Rhodococcus opacus B4. Other phylotypes were 10 associated with alkB genes from Nocardia brasiliensis ATCC 700358 (79% 11 identity) and Acidovorax sp. KKS102 (73% identity), representing 13.6% and 12 9.5% , respectively , of the alkB phylotypes found at sampling site sI. In sample 13 site sR, the most abundant alkB phylotype (15.1%) was related to an alkB gene 14 from Rhodococcus erythropolis (77% identity). Other alkB phylotypes previously 15 found in Pseudomonas aeruginosa PG201 and Pedobacter sp. MS245e 16 represented 10.8% and 8.9%, respectively, of the clone library obtained from 17 sampling sit e sR (Fig. 3A). 18 Comparison among libraries 20 The alkB diversity was used to further analyze the structure of alkane -degrading 21 bacteria present in each sampling site. In all cases, the different soil samples 22 were clustered separately in the dendrogram analys es with less than 40% 23 similarity (Fig. 4). Low numbers of alkB phylotypes were shared between two 24 different sampling sites , and common alkB phylotypes were not found in more 25", "than two sampling sites (Table S2, Fig. 4 B, C). For example, the alkB 1 phylotypes shared among sampling sites s3 and sI were related to an alkB gene 2 from the Acetobacteraceae family (89% sequence identity) and represented 3 only 12.9% and 2% , respectively , of the phylotypes found in these soils. Finally, 4 qualitative beta -diversity measures using unweighted UniFrac analysis 5 confirmed the differences observed among the alkB clone libraries obtained by 6 each sampling point studied here ( p< 0.001). 7 Discussion 9 The importance of the alkane monooxygenase AlkB in bioremediation 10 processes of hydrocarbon -contaminated environments and in biocatalysis for 11 the production of useful compounds justifies the worldwide interest in the 12 distribution of the alkB gene in differen t environments [3], [35]. However, the 13 current literature shows that the diversity of the alkB gene in environmental 14 samples is still far from being well characterized [5], [6], [13], [14]. 15 In this study, we show that the use of a single pair of primers for the 16 PCR amplification of the alkB gene in soil environments as well as in isolated 17 alkane -degrading bacteria limits the range of detection of this gene. However , 18 the use of a combination of alkB-targeting primers results in a more reliable 19 detection of the alkB gene in alkane -degrading bacteria from different soil 20 samples. Even with considering the best combination of alkB-targeting primers, 21 the presence of alkB genes was not detected in 21% of the bacterial strains 22 tested. In a few of these strains , homologous alkB sequences have been 23 previously detected by dot blot hybridizati on [20], [36]. Therefore, enzymes 24 related to cytochrome P450 or others [10], [35] could be responsible for alkane 25", "degradation in the remaining strains. N evertheless , if only the total number 1 (79%) of strains detected with the combination of alkB-targeting primers is 2 considered, our results indicate that 30 .2% or more of alkB-possessing bacteria 3 would be missed from environmental analyses with the use of individual alkB- 4 targeting primers. 5 The use of different alkB-targeting primers to detect alkB genes in 6 different bacterial isolates and also in environment al samples had been used 7 before through dot blot hybridization and qPCR analyses [1], [6], [16], [38][40]. 8 However, no studies have focused on the coverage of each primer and the 9 benefit of using the differen t primers pairs to increase the diversity and richness 10 of alkB phylotypes. Our results demonstrated that the use of a combination of 11 alkB-targeting primers result ed in up to 139% increase in the richness of alkB 12 gene phylotypes obtained in the soils used here. Moreover, the analysis of the 13 clone libraries showed that the richness of alkB phylotypes resulting from the 14 amplification using each of the chosen primers was dependent on the sampling 15 site. Although most of our results indicated that primer pair (e) designed by 16 Kloos et al. [14] generated the most diverse clone libraries in the samples 17 studied, the use of primer pair (d) [5] resulted in the highest diversity and 18 richness at sampling site sI. In contrast , the lowest diversity and richness were 19 detected at this site using primer pair (e). The chemical and physic ochemical 20 properties of the soils, such as pH, TPH, organic matter and/or plant litter, may 21 have influenced the diversity and richness of alkB phylotypes, as suggested by 22 Although the sampling sites used in this study have been studied 24 before [20], [23], this study is the first to perform a deep alkB sequencing 25", "analysis in these soils. Interestingly, our results suggest that different alkB 1 phylotypes were selected depending on the sampling site analyzed, and no 2 phylotype was shared betwe en more than two different King George Island 3 sampling sites (Fig. 4 B, C). In contrast with the results obtained by Powell et al. 4 [17] who studied the alkane -degrading bacteria present on sub -Antarctic 5 Macquarie Island, the sampling sites used here (with their own chemical and 6 physicochemical properties) were sufficient to determine the alkB-containing 7 bacteria l community structure (Table 3, Fig. 4 A, B, C). The observation that 8 alkB clone libraries obtained from each sampling point were considerabl y 9 different from each other (Fig. 4A) in addition to the results obtained from the 10 qualitative beta -diversity measures UniFrac analysis ( p< 0.001) corrobo rate the 11 above statement. 12 The low identities observed among the alkB genes from the different 13 environments studied here (Fig. 3) may indicate an alkB gene diversity yet 14 uncharacterized in natural environments, as suggested previously [5], [6], [13], 15 [14], [23]. Moreover, the alkB phylotypes detected here possess conserved 16 amino acid motifs present in functional AlkB enzymes, suggesting their 17 functional ity in natural environments. As the properties of the enzymes encoded 18 by these alkB genes are still uncharacterized in soil s from Carmópolis and 19 Antarctic a, the isolation and characterization of bacteria harboring these genes 20 are still necessary. 21 Acknowl edgments 23 This study was supported by grants from Conselho Nacional de 24 Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico (CNPq), Coordenação de 25", "Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior (CAPES), and Fundação de 1 Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado do Rio de Janeiro (FAPERJ).

-derived hydrocarbons, bacterial communities, bioindicators, 21 aquatic ecosystems, microcosms 22 Abstract 25 Hydrocarbon -degrading bacterial communi ties from freshwater, marine and hypersaline 26 Brazilian ecosystems were enriched using different hydrocarbons individually 27 (heptadecane, naphthalene and crude oil) to improve the existing tools for biomonitoring 28 petroleum hydrocarbon contamination and the p otential bioremediation of aquatic 29 ecosystems", " Changes within the different microcosms of bacterial communities were 30 analyzed using cultivation -dependent and cultivation -independent methods (DNA and 31 RNA extractions, followed by genetic fingerprinting and c lone library analyses based on 32 the 16S rRNA coding gene)", " The redundancy analysis (RDA) of the genetic fingerprint 33 data and the principal component analysis (PCA) of the clone libraries revealed 34 hydrocarbon -enriched bacterial communities that were specific for each ecosystem 35 studied", " However, within the same ecosystem, different bacterial communities were 36 selected according to each petroleum hydrocarbon used", " In general, the results 37 demonstrated that Acinetobacter and Cloacibacterium were the dominant genera in 38 freshwater, Oceanospirillales order and Marinobacter and Cycloclasticus genera 39 predominated in marine microcosms , and the genus Marinobacter was selected in the 40 different hydrocarbon -containing microcosms of hypersaline water", " DNA genotyping 41 analyses (BOX -PCR) of the isolated bacteria revealed 12 1 different bacterial strains that 42 were isolated from the different enriched microcosms", " A total of 49 (40", "5%) 43 hydrocarbon -degrading isolates were associated with the dominant OTUs obtain ed from 44 the clone libraries, such as bacteria from the Oceanospirillales order and Marinobacter 45 and Acinetobacter genera", " These data provide insight into the general response of the 46 bacterial communities from freshwater , marine and hypersaline aquatic ecos ystems to 47 petroleum hydrocarbon contamination", " 48 INTRODUCTION 49 The extraction of crude oil from oil reservoirs and all activities associated with petroleum 50 production, including crude oil transportation and the storage and use of petroleum - 51 derived fuels, are potential sources of environmental contamination ( 1)", " Moreover, 52 increased oil extraction activities at offshore platforms contribute to the increased 53 susceptibility of marine environments to crude oil contamination ( 2)", " Crude oil is a 54 complex mixture p rimarily composed of aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons, which 55 affect indigenous marine life due to their toxic and carcinogenic effects ( 3)", " 56 Although h undreds of

freshwater samples, respectively, and were dominant in the libraries obtained from 394 these ecosystems contaminated with heptadecane and crude oil ( Fig", " 5; Fig", " 6 )", " The 395 growth capacity of these 49 strains was further evaluated using petroleum hydrocarbo ns 396 as a unique carbon source", " All of the strains demonstrated a capacity for growth using 397 the hydrocarbon contaminating th e microcosms they were isolated from (Table S1)", " 398 DISCUSSION 400 The presence of petroleum hydrocarbon -utilizing bacteria in natural environments is not 401 novel , and the widespread distribution of these bacteria is also well known ( 2)", " 402 However, one of the aims of this study was to characterize the behavior of the dominant 403 bacterial communities of different aquatic ecosystems after short -term incubation with 404 different hydrocarbon inputs (up to 32 days of bacterial contact with hydrocarbons)", " The 405 hydrocarbon contamination in all ecosystems typically resulted in a reduction o f the 406 bacterial diversity and richness and an increase in the bacterial dominance (Table 1 ; 407 Fig", " 3A)", " From the fourth day after the microcosms were established, no change in the 408 structure of the selected dominant bacterial community was observed ( Fig", " S2 )", " In 409 addition, the hydrocarbon -enriched bacterial taxa were not abundant in natural samples 410 or these species were detected in low numbers (Fig", " 3A and 3 B)", " Thus, we propose that 411 the behavior of the bacterial communities after contamination provides importan t 412 information concerning the development of biomonitoring tools", " Moreover, the results 413 obtained from the present study showed that the hydrocarbon -specific enriched -bacteria 414 derived from different samples collected from the same ecosystem were similar and 415 representative (Fig", " S1)", " These results suggest that petroleum hydrocarbon -enriched 416 bacteria are homogenous along the space area of the studied ecosystems", " In addition, 417 these results indicate the presence of a useful distribution of contaminating bacteria for 418 each environmental type, in which the specific bacterial taxa present in low abundance 419 in the natural communities respond to contamination", " This assumption is consistent with 420 the results obtained after the BP Deep Horizon Gulf Spill , where the same dom inant 421 bacterial taxa from different sampling areas were detected in various studies ( 4, 6, 38, 422 Lozupone and Knight ( 40) have previously demonstrated that salinity significantly 424 affects the global pattern of microbial distribution in aquatic environm ents", " However, 425 many studies showed the high impact of petroleum hydrocarbons in the marine 426 microbial structure ( 2, 6, 9, among others)", " However, there are currently no studies 427 comparing the specific hydrocarbon -enriched bacterial communities of different a quatic 428 ecosystems", " Although the network analysis showed that common OTUs were present in 429 samples from contaminated freshwater, marine and hypersaline ecosystems ( Fig", " S4; 430 Fig", " 5), the results of the present study showed that the presence of hydrocarbons 431 enhanced specific bacterial taxa, although this enhancement depended more on the 432 environmental system than on the hydrocarbon used (Fig", " 2 ; Fig", " 4)", " 433 The main bacterial groups enriched from each ecosystem by the presence of 434 different hydrocarbons were identified using molecular (Fig", " S2, Fig", " 3A and 3 B) and 435 culturing methods (Fig", " 6)", " Petroleum hydrocarbon -enriched bacteria are particularly 436 associated w ith well -known bacterial hydrocarbon degraders, which have been 437 previously detected in different studies ( 6, 38, 41 ), suggesting that a limited number of 438 bacterial taxa are involved in petroleum hydrocarbon degradation worldwide", " In addition, 439 our data high light the members of the bacterial communities that are responsible for the 440 degradation of different oil fractions ", " For example, in freshwater microcosms, the 441 presence of aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons enriched the well -known hydrocarbon - 442 degraders Acinetobacter and Cloacibacterium , respectively (Fig", " 3B ; Fig", " 5)", " In this 443 study, the previously described alkane -degrading members of the Oceanospirillales 444 order ( 4, 7, 8, 42, among others), Marinobacter (43, among others) and PAH -degrading 445 Cycloclasticus (9, 12, 44, among others) were also detected in hydrocarbon - 446 contaminated marine microcosms ", " Furthermore, members of Marinobacter were 447 enriched in response to any of the hydrocarbons used in hypersaline contaminated - 448 microcosms (Fig", " 5)", " Bacteria belonging to Marinobacter genus degrade both aliphatic 449 and aromatic fractions of petroleum hydrocarbons ( 43)", " These results suggest that 450 members of this genus are more adapted than those of the Oceanospirillales group in 451 hypersaline ecosystems contaminated with crude o il and heptadecane (Fig", " 3B ; Fig", " 5)", " 452 The data obtained from the clone libraries from each ecosystem revealed that the 453 bacterial taxa enriched by the presence of heptadecane were similar to those enriched 454 by the presence of crude oil (Fig", " 3B ; Fig", " 5)", " How ever, both communities were 455 significantly different from the naphthalene -enriched bacterial communities (Fig", " 3B ; Fig", " 456 S5)", " As aliphatic hydrocarbons represent a readily degradable fraction of crude oil, we 457 propose that the alkane -utilizing bacteria rapidl y increase in relative abundance 458 immediately after crude oil contamination, as previously shown ( 43)", " 459 Based on the results obtained in this study, we conclude that the general 460 patterns of hydrocarbon -enriched bacterial communities are ecosystem dependent", " In 461 addition, the distribution of hydrocarbon -enriched bacterial communities might be used 462 to determine the primary hydrocarbon present in the environment", " Moreover, this 463 pattern appears to be globally distributed within marine ecosystems, and bacteria of t he 464 Oceanospirillales order and Marinobacter and Cycloclasticus genera are predominantly 465 enriched after petroleum hydrocarbon contamination worldwide", " Further studies are 466 needed to confirm the role s of Acinetobacter and Cloacibacterium in hydrocarbon - 467 contaminated freshwater ecosystems and Marinobacter in hydrocarbon -contaminated 468 hypersaline ecosystems", " The isolation of hydrocarbon -enriched bacteria will be useful to 469 understand the physiological behavior of these bacteria after environme ntal 470 contamination", " Although more details are needed, the establishment of biogeographic 471 patterns of hydrocarbon -specific enriched bacterial communities might be important for 472 many industrial activities, such environmental biomonitoring and bioremediation", " 473 ACKNOWLEDGMENTS 476 The authors would like to thank Ricardo B", " Pinto for providing the local 477 coordinates , Diogo F", " Rosas for assistance with the

In order to increaseour knowledge of microorganism -plant interactions in phytoremediation, the bacterial community present in therhizosphere and roots of C. rotundus was evaluated by culture-dependent and molecular approaches. PCR-DGGE analysis based on the 16S rRNA gene showed that thebacterial community in bulk soil, rhizosphere, and rootsamples had a high degree of similarity. A complexpopulation of alkane-utilizing bacteria and a variablenitrogen-fixing population were observed via PCR -DGGE analysis of alkB and nifH genes, respectively. In addition, two clone libraries were generated from alkB fragments obtained by PCR of bulk and rhizosphere soil DNAsamples. Statistical analyses of these libraries showed thatthe compositions of their respective populations weredifferent in terms of alkB gene sequences. Using culture- dependent techniques, 209 bacterial strains were isolatedfrom the rhizosphere and rhizoplane/roots of C. rotundus . Dot-blot analysis showed that 17 strains contained both alkB and nifH gene sequences. Partial 16S rRNA gene sequencing revealed that these strains are affiliated withthe genera Bosea , Cupriavidus , Enterobacter , Gordonia , Mycoplana , Pandoraea , Pseudomonas , Rhizobium , and Rhodococcus . These isolates can be considered to have great potential for the phytoremediation of soil with C.", "rotundus in this tropical soil area.", "Keywords: Petroleum, phytoremediation, Cyperus rotundus , nitrogen fixation, alkane degradationPetroleum is the major energy resource consumed throughout the industrial world [18]. As with any large scale-industrialprocess, petroleum production can lead to contaminationof soil and groundwater [48], and therefore necessitatingremediation of oil pollutants. Over the last few years, the useof plants for environmental cleanup has gained scientificacceptance and popularity among governmental agencies andthe industry [28]. This technology, known as phytoremediation,makes use of the naturally occurring processes by whichplants and rhizosphere microbial flora degrade and sequesterorganic and inorganic pollutants [47]. One benefit of phytoremediation is that a unique plant can remediate a contaminated environment in several ways.Low-molecular-weight compounds can be removed fromthe soil and released through leaves via evapotranspiration processes (phytovolatilization), whereas some of thenonvolatile compounds can be degraded or rendered nontoxicvia enzymatic modification and sequestration within the plant (phytodegradation, phytoextraction). Other compoundsare stable in the plant and can be removed along with thebiomass by sequestration or incineration [47]. However,the main contribution of the plant to the remediation ofpetroleum hydrocarbons is through the rhizoremediationprocess, which is based on its interaction with the microbesassociated with its rhizosphere [10, 22]. Complex interactionsinvolving roots, root exudates, rhizosphere soil, and microbesresult in accelerated degradation of toxic organic compoundsto nontoxic (or at least less toxic) forms. Sugars, organic acids, and larger organic compounds are released by plants to the environment, stimulating thegrowth of surrounding microorganisms. Bacteria found inthe rhizosphere can positively influence plant growth andhealth by a variety of mechanisms, such as increasingthe bioavailability of nitrogen (through nitrogen fixation);repressing soilborne pathogens (by the production of hydrogen *Corresponding author 863 Jurelevicius et al.", "cyanide, siderophores, antibiotics, and/or competition for nutrients); improving plant tolerance to drought stress, highsalinity, and metal toxicity; and producing phytohormonesand solubilizing inorganic phosphate [10, 13]. The bacteriaresponsible for one or more of these characteristics areknown as plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR)[16]. Moreover, in polluted sites, plant exudates can stimulatespecific bacterial populations such as contaminant-degradingmicroorganisms, thereby reducing the toxic effects of thepollutants on the plants. For a phytoremediation process tobe successful, both plants and microbes must survive andgrow in contaminated sites [25, 28, 48]. In Carmópolis, located in northeast Brazil, a plant identified as Cyperus rotundus L. is capable of growing in an area of soil previously contaminated with crude oil. This plantspecies, also known as coco-grass, purple nut sedge, or rednut sedge, is a cosmopolitan weedy sedge usually foundgrowing in all soil types, from sea level to high mountains,in cultivated fields, grasslands, roadsides, neglected areas,at the edges of woods, and in sandy or gravelly shores [11].Once established, this plant is very persistent and canwithstand prolonged drought or inundation [24]. Theantibacterial, antioxidant, cytotoxic, and apoptotic activitiesof tuber extracts of C. rotundus have been observed in vitro [14]. In addition, previous studies have demonstrated theinvolvement of C. rotundus in phytoremediation of herbicides and heavy metals [4, 29].", "In the present study, we hypothesized that there is a bacterial community present in the rhizosphere and/orrhizoplane/root interior of C. rotundus grown in oil- contaminated soil that supports or promotes plant growthby reducing the toxic effects of the crude oil and/or actingas PGPR. Therefore, the aims of our work were (i) to studythe bacterial community present in the rhizosphere soil androots of C. rotundus using molecular methods based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) -denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and clone libraries, and (ii)to isolate bacterial strains capable of both degrading crudeoil and potentially fixing atmospheric nitrogen. Suchstrains would be considered potentially valuable for thephytoremediation process in this tropical area. M ATERIALS AND METHODS Site Description and Sampling The experimental area was located at a large on-shore petroleum exploration and production site in Carmópolis, in northeast Brazil.The soil had a very clay texture (37% sand, 5% silt, and 58% clay) with a slightly acidic pH (6.0) and no history of previous oil contamination. Chemical characteristics of the soil can be summarizedas follows: organic carbon, 0.58%; N and P content, 1.16 and 0.34 g/kg soil, respectively; Ca of soil. The study site (4 soil plots, 3 m ×3 m each) was constructed to analyze the bacterial community during the in situ bioremediationof oil and/or produced water-contaminated soil for a 2-year period by members of PETROBRAS, the Brazilian oil company. One of the plots was contaminated three times with a total of 40 l of crude oil over a 14-month period. At the end of the experiment (when the amount of the total petroleum hydrocarbon, or TPH, was decreased to 42% of the initial value; data not shown), this plot was found tobe naturally colonized by one kind of plant, later identified as Cyperus rotundus L. To study the bacterial community associated with the rhizosphere and roots of this species, nine plants with nosignificant variation in height (about 15 cm) were harvested and the roots were shaken to remove loosely attached soil. To minimize the number of replicates, the plants were grouped into three samples (A,B, and C, each composed of three plants). The soil adhering to the roots of each group of plants was pooled and considered to be the rhizosphere soil. Roots (1 g from A, B, and C) were mixed with9 ml of distilled water and shaken for 10 min. Thereafter, the water was discarded and another 9 ml of water was added to the roots.", "This procedure was repeated three times. The washed roots werethen chopped and were considered to represent the rhizoplane plus root interior. In addition, samples of bulk soil (not associated with roots) were also collected from the same plot. The samples were kept at -20oC until DNA extraction was performed, or at room temperature for the isolation of bacterial strains.", "Isolation and Maintenance of Bacterial Strains Associated with C. rotundus Pre-enrichment cultures were obtained by adding 1 g of rhizospheresoil or washed root/rhizoplane from each combined sample in flasks containing 10 ml of Bushnell-Haas medium (BH; Difco) supplemented with 0.1% crude oil obtained from the local oil field. After 7 days ofincubation at 28 oC, 1 ml of each pre-enriched culture was transferred to a new flask with 10 ml of BH and incubated under the same conditions. Enrichment cultures were then plated onto two differentculture media: LB (1% tryptone, 0.5% yeast extract, 0.5% NaCl, 1.2% agar, pH 7.2) and thiamine-biotin -nitrogen (TBN) agar [36].", "LB plates were incubated at 32oC for 48 h and TBN plates were incubated for 5 days at 28oC in Gaspak jars with an atmosphere of 80% N2, 10% CO2, and 10% H2 to facilitate isolation of nitrogen- fixing strains. Colonies presenting different morphologic characteristicswere selected for further purification under aerobic conditions. Thereafter, bacterial cultures were stored at -80oC in LB medium containing 20% glycerol.", "Microplate Assay Isolates from rhizosphere soil and washed root/rhizoplane obtainedfrom both solid media were screened for their ability to degrade crude oil. The isolates grown in LB medium (described above) were washed twice with sterile saline (0.85%). Twenty-four-well microplates were filled with 1.8 ml per well of BH and 200 µl of each isolate. A drop (approx. 50 µl) of crude oil was added to each well, forming an oil film on the surface of the medium, and plates were incubated for 7 days at 32 oC. Oil biodegradation was determined visually during incubation by observing alterations in the appearance of the oil film.", "DNA Extraction DNA was extracted directly from bulk and rhizosphere soils and from root samples (0.5 g of each) using a FastPrep Spin Kit for soilDNA (BIO 101 Systems, CA, U.S.A.) as described by the manufacturer. Genomic DNA was extracted from all bacterial strains using the BACTERIAL COMMUNITIES ASSOCIATED WITH CYPERUS ROTUNDUS 864 protocol described in Pitcher et al . [30].

DGGE profiles were analyzed with GelCompar II 4.06 (Applied Maths, Kortrijk, Belgium). The Pearson correlation coefficient for each pairof lanes within each gel was calculated as a measure of the similarity between profiles as described previously [6]. A binary matrix based on the presence (1) or absence (0) of individual bands of DGGEfingerprints was constructed independently for each gel. Hierarchical cluster analysis was performed using the Pearson coefficient of similarity and the unweighted pair group method with arithmeticmean (UPGMA) in GelCompar.

A total of 209 colonies presenting a variety of morphologies were selected to test their abilityto degrade hydrocarbons in 24-well plates. Of the coloniestested, 102 and 107 were isolated from the rhizosphere andrhizoplane/root interior, respectively, and 151 and 58 wereisolated from LB and TBN plates, respectively (data notshown).

Fragments of the expected sizewere obtained in at least one of the amplification reactionsusing all strains tested (data not shown). To aid in the phylogenetic placement of alkB (+) and nifH (+) strains, fragments corresponding to a part of the 16S rRNA gene from these 17 isolates were sequenced.BLASTN analysis revealed that these isolates are affiliatedwith the genera Bosea , Cupriavidus , Enterobacter , Gordonia , Mycoplana , Pandoraea , Pseudomonas , Rhizobium , and Rhodococcus , with identity values varying from 98% to DISCUSSION Some plants stimulate pollutant-degrading microorganismsin their rhizospheres by releasing carbon sources throughoutthe roots (rhizosphere effect), thus increasing the microbialdensity and enhancing microbial catabolism [22, 37]. Inthe present study, the total bacterial community associatedwith Cyperus rotundus grown in a petroleum-contaminated site in northeast Brazil was analyzed by 16S rRNA gene-based PCR -DGGE. Although the bacterial populations in the soil, rhizosphere, and rhizoplane/root interior of C.", "rotundus were grouped separately (Fig. 1A), they shared ahigh degree of similarity (94%) as determined by hierarchical cluster analysis. Therefore, the selection of a specificbacterial community associated with the rhizosphere/root ofC. rotundus was not observed. This result was corroborated by the statistical analyses presented in Table 1. In the sameway, Siciliano et al. [37] could not demonstrate any changes in bacterial diversity using a 16S rRNA gene-basedapproach, although an increase in the catabolic potential ofrhizosphere soil associated with tall fescue and rose cloverwas detected. However, the authors were able to demonstratethat the change in bacterial composition was linked tospecific functional genotypes with relevance to petroleumhydrocarbon degradation. When analyzing the hydrocarbon-utilizing bacterial populations associated with C. rotundus by alkB PCR DGGE, complex profiles were observed in all of the sample types studied (Fig. 1B). The results of the clustering analysissuggest that alkB-containing populations present in the rhizosphere and rhizoplane/root interior of C. rotundus were different from those present in the bulk soil. Somestudies have demonstrated that alkane-utilizing bacteria oralkB genotypes are present in high levels in the rhizosphere when compared with bulk soil [15, 25, 37]. Although ourstudy could not demonstrate differences in the diversity ofalkB sequences between sample types based on the Shannon index (Table 1), hierarchical cluster analysis showed thedissimilarity of alkB sequences between the rhizosphere plus rhizoplane/root interior and bulk soil profiles.", "Considering that changes in the composition (linked to specific functional genotypes) of bacterial communitiesassociated with plants that promote petroleum hydrocarbonTable 2.

When considering the phylogenetic position of the 37 clones, a high prevalence of clones related to alkB from Actinobacteria was observed in both the rhizosphereand bulk soils (Fig. 2). Other studies have highlighted theability of Actinobacteria to degrade a wide range of short-to long-chain alkanes [43, 44]. In addition, Gram-positiveGC-rich bacteria are considered to be K-strategists, beinggenerally adapted to resource-limited conditions. In contrast,most Gram-negative alkane-utilizing bacteria, such asPseudomonas , are r-strategists and are able to grow using only short- and medium-chain alkanes [45]. We hypothesizethat after the soil in Carmópolis was contaminated with oil,the most easily degradable short- and medium-chain alkanesmight have been used as a C source by r-strategist bacteria,whereas the heaviest portion of petroleum remainingmight have selected K-strategists capable of using theselarger molecules, as has also been suggested by Quatrini et al. [33]. In addition, when the two libraries were compared using LIBSHUFF, they were found to be statisticallydifferent despite the prevalence of Actinobacteria in boththe bulk soil and rhizosphere. This result suggests firstlythat, after colonization, C. rotundus stimulates a specific alkane-utilizing population, enabling it to coexist in therhizosphere, and secondly that the clone library strategywas more sensitive to differences between bacterial populationspresent in the rhizosphere and bulk soils than the DGGEanalysis using alkB primers. The microbial community associated with the rhizosphere of plants found in contaminated areas can also be involvedin protecting them against chemical injury [40] and promotingtheir growth, acting as PGPR [13]. Nitrogen is an elementessential for life, and is often a limiting factor for bothplant growth and microbial hydrocarbon degradation [32,42]. Only some bacterial and archaeal species are capableof transforming N", "2 to ammonia, and this process, called", "biological nitrogen fixation (BNF), is the major source ofnitrogen in many terrestrial sites [34]. However, the effectof petroleum hydrocarbons on nitrogen-fixing bacteria isalmost unknown [32]. For this reason, potential nitrogen-fixing bacterial populations associated with C. rotundus were characterized by nifH PCR -DGGE. The resulting DGGE profiles showed low values of similarity in theUPGMA-assisted cluster analysis between bulk soil andrhizosphere/root samples, suggesting that nifH-containing bacteria were selected by C. rotundus . However, the profiles were highly variable among triplicates, in contrast with theresults obtained for the total bacterial community and thealkane-utilizing bacterial population. Since it is known thata high concentration of hydrocarbons is toxic to manymicroorganisms [26], this variability could be explained bya deleterious effect of the oil contamination on some of the nitrogen-fixing bacteria. BLASTN analysis of the sequencesof the two bands that occurred in most replicates of nifH PCR -DGGE and a third band that appeared in both bulk and rhizosphere soil samples showed that they were relatedto the nifH gene of Bradyrhizobium sp. and Burkholderia sp. Although Bradyrhizobium species are mostly associated with leguminous plants, previous studies have demonstratedthe importance of this genus to nitrogen input in non-leguminous plants [3]. In the same way, species ofBurkholderia are found colonizing the rhizosphere and roots of diverse plants, showing a capacity to fix nitrogen,to produce siderophores, and to solubilize phosphate [2,21]. Moreover, species belonging to this genus are frequentlyfound in contaminated sites [49], and the capacity ofBurkholderia to utilize hydrocarbons has been studied in detail [20].", "We also attempted to isolate bacterial strains from the rhizosphere soil and roots of C. rotundus that were able to simultaneously degrade hydrocarbons and present plantgrowth-promoting characteristics. Despite the potentialenrichment with hydrocarbon degraders, only 37.8% of the209 isolates were capable of growing in the presence ofpetroleum hydrocarbons as the sole carbon source in themicroplate assay. Positive alkB dot-blot hybridization results were obtained with the DNA of 56 of the 79 hydrocarbon degraders usinga DIG-labeled probe. V omberg and Klinner [45], whenstudying the distribution of alkB genes among alkane- utilizing bacteria, showed the difficulty of analyzinghybridization results when working with the DNA ofdifferent bacteria. In our study, data were obtained bycomparison with the negative controls, which did nothybridize with the alkB probe, thus demonstrating its high specificity. The same result was obtained using the nifH probe. Of the alkB (+) strains, 17 have sequences with homology to nifH in their genomes. Additionally, the presence of part of the nifH sequence was confirmed in all of these isolates by PCR amplification using different setsof nifH primers. Considering the potential use of these 17 isolates in phytoremediation with C. rotundus , their 16S rRNA genes were partially sequenced. BLASTN analysis showed that these isolatesare affiliated with Alpha-, Beta-, and Gammaprotebacteria andActinobacteria (Table 2). Gram-negative bacteria belongingto Burkholderiales, Enterobacteriales, Pseudomonodales,and Rhizobiales are commonly found in association withplants, and many studies have demonstrated their importanceto phytoremediation. For example, members of the genusEnterobacter have been described as plant growth promoters in a hydrocarbon-contaminated site [12]. Interestingly,three isolates presenting homology to alkB and nifH were identified as Rhodococcus sp. and Gordonia sp. Members of these two Gram-positive, high GC-containing genera are 869 Jurelevicius et al.", "not usually cited in the literature as nitrogen fixers; however, they are recognized for their ability to degrade environmental pollutants, and are considered potentially useful for applicationsin environmental and industrial biotechnology [1, 9]. Escalante-Espinosa et al. [8] have demonstrated the participation of Gordonia sp. in phytoremediation using Cyperus laxus Lam. However, the present study is the first to describestrains belonging to the genus Gordonia as harboring at least part of the gene encoding nitrogenase reductase.", "In conclusion, the present study extends our current knowledge regarding the diversity of the microbiota associatedwith C. rotundus . Different bacterial strains from the rhizosphere soil and roots of C. rotundus with the ability to simultaneously degrade hydrocarbons and potentially fix nitrogen have now become available for further study. It is hoped thatthese strains will efficiently promote phytoremediation inassociation with C. rotundus grown in a tropical soil.

Because of the antimicrobial compounds (mainly thymol and carvacrol) found in the essential oil, we believe that t he endophytic microorganisms found in L. sidoides are selected to live in different parts of the plant. Results In this study, the endophytic microbial communities from the stem s and leaves of four L. sidoides genotypes were determined using cultivation-dependent and cultivation-indepe ndent approaches. In total, 145 endophytic bacterial strains were isolate d and further grouped using either ERIC-PCR or BOX-PCR, resulting in 76 groups composed of differ ent genera predominantly belonging to the Gammaproteobacteria. The endophytic mi crobial diversity was also analyzed by PCR-DGGE using 16S rRNA-based universal and group-specific primers for total bacteria, Alphaproteobacteria, Betaproteobacte ria and Actinobacteria and 18S rRNA-based primers for fungi. PCR-DGGE profile analysis and principal component analysis showed that the total bacteria, Alphaproteobacteria, Be taproteobacteria and fungi were influenced not only by the location within the plant (leaf vs. s tem) but also by the presence of the main components of the L. sidoides essential oil (thymol and/or carvacrol) in the leaves. However, the same could not be observed within the Actinobacteria. Conclusion The data presented here are the first step to begin shedding light on the impact of the essential oil in the endophytic microorganisms in pepper-rosmarin.", "Keywords Lippia sidoides , Essential oil, Stem, Leaf, Endophytic bacteria and fungi, Plant- microorganism interaction Background Lippia sidoides Cham ., popularly known as pepper-rosmarin, is an aromatic and medicinal plant species of the family Verbenaceae. This plant is a typic al shrub commonly found in northeast Brazil that produces a highly scented essential oil in its leaves. The L. sidoides essential oil has potential economic value because of its industria l use in the commercial production of perfumes, creams, lotions and deodorants [1]. Moreover, the leave s of L. sidoides are also extensively used in folk medicine for the treatment of acne, wounds, skin and scalp infections [1], allergic rhinitis and vaginal, mouth and throa t infections [2]. When tested against different pathogenic bacteria, including Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa , as well as different fungi, including yeasts, dermatophytes and filamentous fungi, the essential oil from L. sidoides proved to be very promising as an antimicrobial compound [3,4]. Additionally, it has been previously demonstr ated that the L. sidoides essential oil has insecticidal activity against the coleopter an Tenebrio molitor , larvicidal activity against Aedes aegypti linn and acaricidal activity against the two-spotted spider mite ( Tetranychus urticae Koch) [5-7]. Thus, the essential oil produced by L. sidoides is of great interest and value because of its bactericidal, f ungicidal, molluscicidal and larvicidal properties.", "The major constituents of the essential oil of L. sidoides are thymol and carvacrol, which are responsible for the remarkable inhibitory activity against microorgani sms [1,8,9]. However, the environmental conditions (such as soil type, the use of organic or m ineral fertilizers, temperature, humidity and exposure to the sun and wind) where L. sidoides is cultivated may influence the chemical composition of the volatile oils [9,10]. Additionall y, the amount of the essential oil components produced can vary depending on the plant genotype [11]. In other plants, the presence of intracellular bacteria found in asso ciation with the essential oil cells, such as the lysigen lacunae in vetiver root ( Chrysopogon zizanioides ), and the participation of bacteria in the biotransformation of essential oils have been previously demonstrated [12-14]. However, no evidence exists to suggest the partic ipation of the endophytic microbial community in the transformation of the essentia l oil in L. sidoides , which appears to be associated with plant trichomes [15]. Here, we h ypothesize that this community is influenced by the production of the volatile compounds of the essentia l oil in L. sidoides leaves. To the best of our knowledge, few studies concerning the micr obial endophytic community associated with L. sidoides have been performed to date that specifically use the genotypes and environmental conditions of northeast Brazil. Thus, the microbial communities from the stems and leaves of four L. sidoides genotypes (LSID003, LSID006, LSID104 and LSID105), which show different amounts of carvacrol and thymol, were determined using cultivation-dependent and cultivation-independent a pproaches. We used 16S rRNA-based universal and group-specific primers for total ba cteria, Alphaproteobacteria, Betaproteobacteria and Actinobacteria, as well as 18S rRNA-based primers for fungi, in combination with molecular (PCR-DGGE) and s tatistical (Principal Component Analysis - PCA) tools to evaluate whether the essential oil affects the endophytic microbial community in pepper-rosmarin.", "Methods Plants, sampling and experimental conditions This study was conducted at the Experimental Farm “The Rural C ampus of UFS”, located in São Cristóvão (geographical coordinates: latitude 11°00 ′ S and longitude 37° 12 ′ W) in northeast Brazil. The soil of this area is characterized as a red-yellow argisoil with the following chemical characteristics: pH – 5.4; organic matter – 21.1 g dm -3; P – 2.3 mg dm -3; K – 0.09 cmolc dm -3 (Mehlich 1); Ca + Mg – 2.70 cmolc dm -3; Al – 0.71 cmolc dm -3; S - – 2.76 mg dm -3. The seedlings were produced by utilizing approximately 15 cm-st aked herbaceous offshoots. A mixture of washed coconut shell powder and washed sa nd (2:1) and 20 g l -1 of Biosafra® organomineral biofertilizer (3-12-6) were used as s ubstrata for the rooted cuttings. Seedlings of approximately 20 cm were then ta ken to the field. The experimental plot consisted of rows with spaces of 1 m between the rows and 1 m between plants. The soil was first fertilized with 3 l per m 2 of aged bovine manure and four L. sidoides genotypes (LSID003, LSID006, LSID0104 and LSID0105) showing differences in their origin and the composition of the essential oils produced were planted i n each row. The chemical composition of the essential oil produced by each genotype has been previously described by Blank et al. [16] and is summarized in Table 1. Drip i rrigation was conducted daily.", "Table 1 Genotypes of pepper-rosmarin ( Lippia sidoides Cham.), their origins, and the major constituents and yield of their essential oils Major chemical constituents (%) * Genotype Origin Thymol Carvacrol Oil yield (ml plant -1) LSID003 Mossoró - RN LSID006 Tabuleiro do Norte - CE LSID104 Poço Redondo - SE LSID105 Poço Redondo - SE * These values correspond to individual measures performed in two consecutive years [16]. Three plants of each L. sidoides genotype were harvested in the morning period with the plants in full flower, and 20 pieces of stems (approximately 30 cm i n length) with leaves were sampled from each plant.", "Stem and leaf samples were surface sterilized by rinsing wi th 70% ethanol for 2 min, 2.5% sodium hypochlorite for 5 min, 70% ethanol for 30 sec and then washing thre e times with sterile distilled water. Only the stem samples were subjec ted to UV light exposure for 5 min prior to the final water wash. To check the efficiency of the dis infection procedure, 100 µl of the water used in the last wash was plated onto Trypticase Soy Broth (TSB) agar-containing plates and incubated for 5 days at 32°C. Samples that were not contamina ted according to the culture-dependent sterility test were cut into pieces of approxim ately 5 cm, 3 g of each stem and leaf samples were homogenized with 10 ml of sterile distill ed water in a sterilized mortar and pestle and used for counting and isolation of endophytic bacterial st rains and for DNA isolation.", "Counting, isolation and DNA extraction of endophyti c bacterial strains To determine the colony forming units per ml (CFU ml -1) in the stems and leaves of the different L. sidoides genotypes, each macerated sample (1 ml) obtained after disinfec tion was mixed with 9 ml of distilled water, and serial dilutions of these samples were pl ated onto TSB agar plates containing 1% nystatin (50 µg ml -1) and incubated for 5 days at 32°C. Colonies presenting different morphological characteristics in each plate used were selected for further purification. Bacterial cultures were stored at −80°C in TSB w ith 10% glycerol. All isolates were first divided based on their Gram staining characteristi cs. Genomic DNA was extracted from all bacterial strains using the protocol described by Pitcher et al. [ 17]. DNA preparations were separated by electrophoresis on an 0.8% agarose gel in 1X Tr is/Borate/EDTA (TBE) buffer [18] and visualized to assess their integrity, then stored at 4°C prior to PCR amplification.", "BOX-PCR, ERIC-PCR and the molecular identification of selected bacterial strains Amplification reactions using the primers BOXA1R [19] and ERIC1R and ERIC2F [20] were performed in the following mix: 1 µl (50–100 ng) of target DNA; 5 µl of 5X PCR buffer (Promega, RJ, Brazil); 2.5 mM (ERIC) or 3.75 mM (BOX) MgCl 2; 0.5 mM dNTP; 0.4 µM and 1 µM of the primers ERIC1R - ERIC2F or BOXA1R, respectively; an d 0.5 U (ERIC) or 1.25 U (BOX) of Taq polymerase in a 25 µl final volume. The cycle applied was 1 × [7 min at 95°C], 35 × [1 min at 94°C, 1 min at 52°C (with ERIC primers) or 53°C (with BOXA1R primer), 8 min at 65°C] and a final extension of 16 min at 65°C. Negativ e controls (without DNA) were run during all amplifications. Agarose gel electrophor esis of PCR products was performed using 1.4% agarose in 1X TBE buffer at 90 V for 4 h at room temperature. The BOX and ERIC-PCR results were collected into matrices indica ting the presence or absence (scored as 1 or 0, respectively) of bands. Dendrograms were constructed using D ice similarity coefficients and the unweighted pair group method with arithmeti c mean (UPGMA) through the BioNumerics software package (Applied Maths, Ghent, Belgium). For molecular identification of the selected isolates, their 16S rRNA coding gene was amplified by PCR using the pair of universal primers pA and pH and t he conditions described in Massol-Deya et al. [21]. The PCR products were then sequenced b y Macrogen (South Korea). The partial 16S rRNA gene sequences (~800 bp) were identifi ed using the BLAST-N tool (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast) on the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) website using the GenBank non-redundant database. A phylogeneti c tree was constructed based on partial 16S rRNA gene sequences using the ne ighbor-joining method. MEGA 5.1 software was used to calculate Jukes-Cantor distances. Boot strap analyses were performed with 1,000 repetitions, and only values higher than 50% are shown in the phylogenetic tree.", "Susceptibility of the bacterial isolates to the ess ential oil obtained from L. sidoides genotypes LSID006 and LSID104 The determination of the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was performed using a serial dilution technique in 0.2 ml thin-walled 8 strip cap microtubes a s recommended by CLSI M7-A4 for bacteria [22]. Bacterial isolates from the four genotypes were tested for susceptibility. The investigated essential oils containing contras ting amounts of thymol and carvacrol (Table 1) were diluted seven times using doubling dilution, fr om 4 to 0.03 mg ml -1, and 1 µl of each dilution was added to 189 µl TSB with 10 µl of the bacterial suspension (cells grown to a O.D. = 0.09 at 625 nm, then diluted 50X in TSB). The micr otubes were incubated for 48 h at 32°C. Positive controls consisted of inoculated grow th medium without the essential oil. The results were based on visual growth of bact erial strains, which was confirmed after the aseptic addition of 30 µl of resazurin to the tubes and further incubation at 32°C for 30 min. The MIC was defined as the minimum concentration of t he essential oil resulting in complete growth inhibition [23]. A paired two-sample t-test was used to compare the growth range of the strains tested with different concentrat ions of both essential oils. P values of <0.05 were considered statistically significant.", "DNA extraction from stem and leaf samples The total microbial community DNA was extracted directly from stem and leaf samples (0.5 g of each sample in triplicate) using the FastPrep Spin kit f or soil DNA (BIO 101 Systems, CA, USA). DNA preparations were visualized after electrophore sis in a 0.8% agarose gel in 1X TBE buffer to assess their integrity and then stored at 4°C prior to PCR amplif ication.

Principal component analysis (PCA) was used as described previously [31] using the PC-ORD statistical software [32]. Nucleotide sequence accession numbers The nucleotide sequences determined in this study for the culturable bacterial community were deposited in the GenBank database under accession numbers JX471071 – JX 471146 and for the DGGE band sequences in the DDBJ database under accession num bers Results The bacterial community in the stems and leaves of four L. sidoides genotypes as determined by a cultivation-dependent approach After disinfecting the stems and leaves of the different L. sidoides genotypes, serial dilutions of these samples were plated onto TSB agar plates for counting a nd selection of bacterial strains. Table 3 shows the determination of the colony forming units (CFU ml -1) in the stems and leaves. Across the four genotypes, the number of bacterial ce lls varied from zero to 1.6 x 10 3 CFU ml -1 in the leaves and 1.2 to 3.4 x 10 5 CFU ml -1 in the stems. Colonies presenting different morphologies in each plate used for counting were selec ted for further characterization. In total, 145 strains were collected: for stem s, 37 were from LSID003, 36 from LSID006, 26 from LSID104 and 29 from LSID105; 17 strains were collect ed from the leaves of LSID105. The strains were then Gram-stained; 96 of the strains were Gram- negative and 49 were Gram-positive (Table 3). DNA from both Gram-ne gative and Gram- positive strains was then amplified using ERIC and BOX-PCR, respe ctively, for a preliminary screening of their diversity. Based on 70% similarit y, 76 groups were formed: 49 groups originated from ERIC-PCR and 27 from BOX-PCR. While differ ent groups were formed by a single strain, others were formed by two to six strains (data not shown).

PCR fragments (~800 bp) obtained from part of the 16S rRNA coding gen e of one representative strain belonging to different ERIC and BOX groups were sequenced, and the sequences obtained were compared to those in GenBank using the BLAST-N tool. Different genera could be associated with the sequences analyzed (Figure 4), with the majority of the strains (66.2%) being associated with Gammaproteobacteria and the remaining ones with Firmicutes and Actinobacteria. Strains isolated from the leaves were predominantly related to Firmicutes or Actinobacteria. While some genera/species were f ound exclusively in one genotype (for example: Stenotrophomonas maltophila was only found in the stems of LSID104 and Pseudomonas psychrotolerans , Brevibacterium casei and Citrobacter freundii /C. murliniae in LSID003), others could be detected in all genotypes, such as Pantoea/Erwinia and Enterobacter cowanii . Two other genera ( Bacillus and Corynebacterium ) were exclusively found in the leaves of LSID105 (Figure 4). The i solates found were associated with B. nealsonii /B. circulans and C. variabilis , respectively. The most diverse culturable endophytic bacterial community was observed withi n the stems of the LSID003 genotype, while the least diverse was found in the stems of LSID105 (Figure 4).

The symbols ( ■) and ( ●) in the tree branches represent the isolates To determine the susceptibility of the bacterial isolates to the essential oil obtained from L. sidoides genotypes LSID006 and LSID104 containing contrasting amounts of thymol a nd carvacrol (Table 1), MICs were determined by a doubling dilution tech nique using the two essential oils at eight concentrations (from 4 to 0.03 mg ml -1). From the MIC determination (Figure 5), 85.7% and 74.6% of the strains tested presented a MIC ≥ 0.25 mg ml -1 for the essential oil from genotypes LSID006 and LSID104, respectively, sugge sting an intermediate susceptibility of the isolates to the presence of both essential oi ls. When a paired two-sample t-test was used, the strain susceptibility pattern against each of the essential oils was considered statistically significant ( P = 0.05).", "Figure 5 Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) determination of the isolate d strains for the essential oil from genotypes LSID006 and LSID104.", "The bacterial community in the stems and leaves of four L. sidoides genotypes as determined by a cultivation-independent approach In a cultivation-independent approach (PCR-DGGE), the endophytic bacterial , actinobacterial and fungal communities were evaluated with respect to their struc tures in the stems and leaves of L. sidoides genotypes. Highly reproducible PCR-DGGE profiles were obtained from triplicate samples (stems and leaves from the four genotypes ) from all communities evaluated in our experiment, indicating the robustness of the PCR-D GGE analyses (data not shown). To facilitate the comparison and further extraction of bands, two replicates per sample were loaded onto each gel.", "The total bacterial community was first evaluated using the 16S r RNA primer pairs described by Nübel et al. [26]. The DGGE profiles were found to be very simi lar when DNA samples (stems or leaves) obtained from the four genotypes were compared. How ever, the same was not observed when the stem-derived samples were compared to leaf-der ived samples (Figure 1a). Although certain common bands were detected in all of the sa mples, it appears that the colonization of the interior of the stems of L. sidoides is dominated by strains that are different from those found in the leaves. Cluster analysis corroborat ed the visual interpretation of the DGGE profiles, as stem-derived samples we re separated from leaf- derived samples at approximately 50% (Figure 1a). Some bands (marke d with the letter A, followed by a number) were retrieved from the gel, reamplifi ed and sequenced. Phylogenetic comparison of 14 bands revealed seven sequences affiliated with Enterobacter sp. (A2-A4, A7-A10), one with Pantoea sp. (A5) and six with chloroplast DNA (A1, A6, A11-A14). To minimize the annealing of the 16S rRNA-based primers with chlor oplast DNA, a nested- PCR using the primers described by Chelius and Triplett [29] in t he first round of amplification was chosen to re-evaluate the endophytic bacterial community in L. sidoides . An increase in the number of bands in the DGGE gel was observed, resulting in the sequencing of 30 bands (marked in Figure 1b with the letter B, follow ed by a number). Likewise, the diversity of genera also increased with the phylog enetic affiliation of the PCR fragments, and sequences related to Pantoea (B8, B10, B11, B13, B14, B29), Pseudomonas (B1, B3, B4, B9, B30), Enterobacter (B6, B20, B25, B28), Erwinia (B2, B12), Cronobacter (B26, B27), Rhizobium (B5), Lactococcus (B7), and Escherichia (B24) could be found. Similar to the identification of the bacterial isolates, membe rs of the Gammaproteobacteria were predominant in the endophytic bacterial community found in L. sidoides when molecular techniques were used. However, the remaining eight bands a nalyzed in Figure 1b, predominantly found in the leaves, were related to chloroplast DNA. Mor eover, from the cluster analysis, we observed that stem-derived and leaf-deri ved samples were separated into two groups (Figure 1b), as previously demonstrated when the primers U9 68 and L1401 were used in a single PCR amplification round. L. sidoides genotypes do not seem to influence the endophytic bacterial community as much as the location in the plant where this community is found (stem vs. leaf) does (Figure 1b).", "Because the Gammaproteobacteria appeared to predominate inside the L. sidoides plants studied, which made it difficult to recover members of the bacteri al community found in low numbers, primers for specific bacterial groups were used to detect Alphaproteobacteria, Betaproteobacteria and Actinobacteria. When the nested-PCR describe d in Gomes et al. [30] for detecting Alphaproteobacteria was used, a clear distinction bet ween the leaf-derived profiles and those from the stems could be observed in DGGE (Figure 2a ). Twenty-five bands were retrieved from the gel (marked in Figure 2a with the letter C, followed by a number), and the resulting sequencing allowed the identification of predom inantly Rhizobium sp. (15 bands: C1, C4-C15, C17, C20). One sequence could be associated with Balneimonas (C18) and another with Agrobacterium (C19). Still, five selected bands were related to chloroplast DNA (C2, C3, C16, C24, C25). However, two sequences were affil iated with the genus Cronobacter (C21, C22) and one band with Pantoea (C23), both of which belong to the Gammaproteobacteria. In the dendrogram, profiles obtained from ste ms were separated from those obtained from leaf samples at 40% similarity (Figu re 2a). Again, a more prominent influence of the location within the plant could be observed withi n the community of Alphaproteobacteria found inside the four genotypes of L. sidoides . Endophytic Betaproteobacteria found in the leaves and the stems of L. sidoides were determined using the primers described by Gomes et al. [30]. DGGE profiles (Figure 2b) show that the location in the plant where the Betaproteobacteria comm unity was found also influenced the structure of this community, although this observation is more evident within the leaf-derived community. Cluster analysis corroborated the vi sual interpretation of the DGGE profiles because leaf-derived samples formed a group at 74% (Figure 2b). Plants from the genotype LSID105 appeared to select for the Betaproteobacteri a community present in their stems, as a separate group was formed in the dendrogram at less than 20%. Furthermore, some bands (marked with the letter D, followed by a number) were retrieved from the gel, reamplified and sequenced. Phylogenetic comparison of 26 bands revealed seven sequences affiliated with the genus Ralstonia (D3-D6, D8, D18, D19), four with Acidovorax (D22, D24- D26), three with Massilia (D2, D11, D17), two with Burkholderia (D9, D20) and one band related to each of the following genera: Comamonas (D23), Cupriavidus (D1), Stenotrophomonas (D7), Enterobacter (D12), Cronobacter (D14) and Pantoea (D15). Unexpectedly, the last four genera do not belong to the Betaproteobacteri a, but rather to the Gammaproteobacteria which was the predominant class observed in tot al bacterial community inside the L. sidoides plants studied. Bands D10, D13, D16 and D21 were related to chloroplast DNA. While the genera Comamonas and Acidovorax were only found in leaf samples, Cupriavidus appears to be exclusive to stems.", "For the structure characterization of Actinobacteria, the PCR am plification was performed as described in Heuer et al. [27]. DGGE profiles showed that the sampl es from either the leaves or the stems were less similar among the genotypes than for the other communities studied (Figure 2c). Based on the dendrogram, no specific groupings were obs erved. The location where the actinobacterial community was found (stem vs. leaf) does not seem to influence its structure. Similar to the Betaproteobacteria, plants from the ge notype LSID105 may have selected the actinobacterial community in their stems because a separate group was formed in the dendrogram at less than 15% (Figure 2c).", "Twenty-four bands were retrieved from the DGGE gel (marked in F igure 2c with the letter E, followed by a number). From the sequenced bands, 17 sequences could be associated with the genus Microbacterium (E1-E9, E11-E14, E19-E21, E24), two with Actinobacteria (E10, E22) and one sequence for each of the following genera: Brachybacterium (E15), Cellulomonas (E16) and Nocardioides (E23). Two bands were related to chloroplasts (E17, E18). Although fungal communities were not evaluated by cultivation-depende nt approaches, their diversity was determined in the stems and leaves of the four ge notypes of L. sidoides by PCR-DGGE (using the primers listed in Table 2), contributing to a better understanding of the microbial communities associated with this plant. The resulting DGGE profiles (Figure 3) were more complex than the profiles obtained for the bacterial comm unities. However, an evident distinction between the leaf-derived profiles and those from t he stems could be observed in DGGE, as it was observed for the total bacteria, Alphapr oteobacteria and Betaproteobacteria. Two groups were formed at 54% in the resulting dendrogram based on the location in the plant (Figure 3). Plants from the genotype LSID 003 seemed to select the fungal community present in their leaves, as a separate group was formed in the dendrogram at approximately 20%. Different bands were retrieved from the gel (marked in Figure 3 with the letter F, followed by a number), and their phylogenetic compari son revealed 29 sequences associated with the genus Lasiodiplodia (F2-F4, F6, F8-F10, F12, F13, F15-F18, F20, F21, F22, F36, F48, F49, F51), seven with Mycosphaerella (F38-F40, F42, F43, F45, F46), two with Corynespora (F55, F56) and one with each of the following genera: Neoaleurodiscus (F27), Ceratobasidium (F29), Heteroacanthella (F37), Pantospora (F41), Passalora (F44) and Massarinaceae (F54). While bands related to the genera Neoaleurodiscus and Heteroacanthella were found in the stems, Mycosphaerella , Pantospora , Passalora , Massarinaceae and Corynespora were exclusively detected in the leaves. Although a few members of the Basidiomycota ( Ceratobasidium and Heteroacanthella ) were present, the majority of the bands from both leaves and stems were associated with the As comycota. Principal component analysis (PCA) of DGGE patterns Ordination of the PCR-DGGE profiles using PCA supported the aforement ioned effects of plant location on the bacterial (Alphaproteobacteria and Betaproteobac teria) and fungal communities (Figure 6a, b, c, d, f). This effect was not clearly obs erved for the actinobacterial community (Figure 6e).", "Figure 6 Principal component analysis (PCA) ordination diagram with stem and leaf samples from Lippia sidoides genotypes LSID003, LSID006, LSID104 and LSID105 and the components of the essential oil (thymol and carvacrol) as variables (arrows ): first axis - horizontal, second axis - vertical. The fraction of the total variance accounted for by each axis is indicated in parentheses. The corresponding communities analyze d are as follows: ( a) ( b) total bacteria, ( c) Alphaproteobacteria, ( d) Betaproteobacteria, ( e) Actinobacteria and ( f) fungi. The genotypes are represented by the three first numbers (LSID - 003, 006, 104 and 105), followed by C or F for stem and leaf samples and T1 and T2 corresponding to the replicates.", "The first PCA axes explained 51.2, 32.8, 25.0, 26.3, 25.9 and 23.4% of the variance, wh ereas respectively). With respect to the total bacterial communities , PCA ordination of the samples showed a tendency for these communities to group based on their origin, i. e., from the leaves or from the stems, mainly along the second axis (Figure 6a, b). Furthermore, it was possible to separate the leaf-derived samples in accordance to the prese nce of thymol (Figure 6a, b). PCA of the samples from the Alphaproteobacteria showed a separat ion along the first and second axes of the communities found in the leaves and in the stems ( Figure 6c). While the leaf-derived samples belonging to the genotypes LSID003, LSID006 and L SID105 were grouped in accordance to the presence of thymol, those from LSID104 we re also correlated with the presence of carvacrol (Figure 6c). Likewise, PCA of the Betaproteobacteria samples showed the tendency to group according to plant location. Stem-derived s amples were separated from leaf-derived samples mainly along the first a xis. The Betaproteobacteria community found in the leaves was also associated with the prese nce of thymol (Figure 6d). With respect to the Actinobacteria, PCA ordination of the samples did not show any tendency to group, along either the first or second axes (Figure 6e). In t his case, the presence of thymol does not seem to be related to the actinobacterial communities found in the leaves of L. sidoides (Figure 6e). Finally, PCA ordination of the fungal communities showe d a loose grouping in the function of the plant location along the second axis (F igure 6f). Again, the essential oil component, thymol, may have a positive effect on the selection of the leaf- derived fungal communities.", "Discussion The interaction between plants and microorganisms has already be en studied in different essential oil-producing plants, such as vetiver [13,14,33] and basil [34]. In a few cases, the microbial community associated with the plant interferes with the composition of the essential oil [13,14]. Thus far, there is no evidence that the essent ial oil produced in the leaves of Lippia sidoides (pepper-rosmarin), which is composed mainly of the two strongly antimicrobial monoterpenes thymol and carvacrol, is biotransformed inside the plant. Additionally, no data were available in the literature showing wheth er the essential oil interferes with the diversity of the microbial communities foun d inside of the plant and in strict contact with the volatile components of the essential oil. Therefore, w e used cultivation- dependent and cultivation-independent methods to analyze microorganisms to inc rease our understanding of the behavior of the different microbial communities present in the s tems and leaves (where the essential oil is found) of L. sidoides .", "The CFUs were determined following the disinfection of the stems and leaves of four genotypes of L. sidoides . Bacterial colonization of the interior of L. sidoides was expected as it was previously observed in other plants [35,36]. However, no bacterial c ells were recovered from the leaves of three genotypes (LSID003, LSID006 and LS ID104), and the number of colonies from the leaves of the remaining genotype was much lower than the CFUs found in the stems. We hypothesize that the cells were kill ed when they were placed in direct contact with the essential oil after the maceration of the leaves. The endophytic bacteria found inside the stems would be better protected against t he antimicrobial effect of the essential oil. To support this argument, the susceptibility of t he bacterial isolates to the essential oil obtained from L. sidoides genotypes LSID006 and LSID104 was determined. The essential oil from the genotype LSID006 was chosen to represent the ones f rom LSID003 and LSID105 which are similar in their thymol and carvacrol content s. MIC determination showed that 85.7% and 74.6% of the strains tested presented a MIC ≥ 0.25 mg ml -1 of essential oil from genotypes LSID006 and LSID104, respectively, sugge sting an intermediate sensitivity of the isolates to the presence of both essential oi ls. However, no difference in the susceptibility range could be observed between the stem-derived and l eaf-derived strains. It is important to state that the number of leaf-derived strains test ed was much lower than the number of stem-derived strains, thus compromising the interpretation of the resul ts obtained. In total, 145 endophytic bacterial isolates were obtained mostly fr om the stems. Our results suggest that the most dominant group associated with the L. sidoides genotypes was the Gammaproteobacteria, which is consistent with other studies [33,37,38]. Isolates from the genera Bacillus and Paenibacillus (belonging to the Firmicutes) were mainly obtained from LSID105 leaves (Figure 4). Because members of these genera ar e spore formers, they may have resisted exposure to the essential oil after maceration of the leaves. Although we do not know whether the isolated strains have any plant growth promoting pot ential, other studies have already demonstrated the importance of the different gener a found here as nitrogen fixers, phosphate solubilizers and/or auxin producers in other plants [39,40]. As the cultivation-dependent methodology used was affected by cell dea th in the leaves, the PCR-DGGE approach chosen to determine the structure of the microbia l communities found in the leaves and stems of L. sidoides became crucial to this study. Moreover, it allowed access to the communities (such as the Alphaproteobacteria, Betap roteobacteria and Actinobacteria) possibly present in lower numbers or that failed to grow under the conditions used for isolation.", "Similar results were obtained when the total bacteria (acces sed by two different sets of primers for PCR amplification), Alphaproteobacteria and Betaproteoba cteria communities were considered. Slight differences in DGGE profiles were obse rved among the genotypes; nevertheless, these differences did not contribute to the grouping of the different communities as much as the location in the plant (stem or leaf) where these communities were found. In contrast, plant genotypes were shown to have great influence on the m icrobial communities associated with other plants [41,42].", "While total bacteria and Betaproteobacteria were correlated w ith the presence of thymol in the leaves, the Alphaproteobacteria community was correlated with the presence of both thymol and carvacrol (more specifically in the genotype LSID104 where carvacrol is the main essential oil component). Because Rhizobium was the predominant genus detected within the Alphaproteobacteria community, we may assume that it c an withstand the presence of the volatile components of the essential oil. The same postulation can be made for the genera Comamonas and Acidovorax because they were only found in samples from leaves. In contrast, no specific grouping was observed when Actinobacter ia were considered. Actinobacterial communities do not seem to be influenced drastically by plant location or the presence of the essential oil in the leaves of L. sidoides . It is well documented that Actinobacteria are particularly adapted to survival in harsh envi ronments [43], which may explain why strains belonging to the genera Curtobacterium , Microbacterium , Brevibacterium and Corynebacterium were isolated in this study. Corynebacterium was the only actinobacterial genus found in the leaves (genotype LSID105). When the fungal communities were evaluated, we also observed the i nfluence of the part of the plant sampled on their structure, as previously demonstrated for bacteria. However, the DGGE profiles were more complex, and a greater diversity of genera was observed within the fungal communities. The phylum Ascomycota was prevalent among the different fungal taxa found. Similarly, Siqueira et al. [44] isolated endophytic fungi representing different species belonging to the groups Ascomycota, Coelomycetes and Hyphomy cetes from L. sidoides Cham. In Hevea brasiliensis (rubber tree), Gazis and Chaverri [45] observed fungal communities present in the leaves that were different from those isolated from the stem. Ascomycota was also the prevalent fungal group found. Based on PCA, funga l communities were to some extent correlated with the presence of thymol in the leaves. Conclusion On the basis of the data from bacterial and fungal communities found in the leaves and stems of different genotypes of L. sidoides , we believe that both communities are selected by the conditions found in the interior of the plant. Thus, the presence of an esse ntial oil with antimicrobial properties in the leaves certainly represents har sh survival conditions for the endophytic microorganisms. To understand how the microbial community ass ociated with L. sidoides contributes to the physiology of the plant is the next step to be achieved. Competing interests The authors declare that they have no competing interests.", "Authors’ contributions TFS, REV and DJ carried out the experiments and LS wrote the manus cript.

The genome contained a total of 3,555,295 bp, arranged in a single replicon with an average G ?C percentage of 70.9%. It revealed the presence of complete pathways for basically all central metabolic routes. Also present were completesets of genes for the glyoxalate and reductive carboxylate cycles.

Secondary metabo-", "lism was evidenced by the presence of genes for thebiosynthesis of terpene compounds, frenolicin, nanaomycin and avilamycin A antibiotics. Further- more, a probable role in azinomycin B synthesis, an important product with antitumor activity, was indi- cated. The complete alkoperon for the degradation of n-alkanes was found to be present, as were clusters of genes for biphenyl ring dihydroxylation.

They are widely distributed in nature, as they have been isolated from soil, deep sea sediment, sodalakes, reed rhizomes, skin and the intestinal tracts of marine ﬁsh (Yassin et al. 2006 ).Dietzia cinnamea strain P4 was isolated in a study on the diversity ofhydrocarbon degraders in a tropical rainforest soil in Brazil, with no history of oil contamination (Evans et al. 2004 ). In subsequent work, von der Weid et al.", "(2007 ) demonstrated that D. cinnamea strain P4 is able to degrade a wide range of n-alkanes, pristane as well as phytane, whereas it grows in mineral liquidmedia amended with aromatic hydrocarbons as sole carbon sources. It thus may have applications in the bioremediation of contaminated soils.", "The ability to degrade a wide range of organic compounds probably derives from the lifestyle of D. cinnamea like bacteria, which may assimilate a variety of different carbon sources and may also respond rapidly to environmental stressors, thus coming up with an excellent candidate in bioreme-diation processes in environments that have suffered oil spills. Recently, different strains belonging to Dietzia sp. were also described as petroleum hydro- carbon degraders, conﬁrming their potential for the recovery of areas where oil leakage occurred (Bihari To the best of our knowledge, so far not a single Dietzia genome has been published. In an effort to better understand the relationship between Dietzia - like soil actinomycetes and the tropical soil habitat, including the response to oil contamination, we pyrosequenced and annotated the genome of D. cinna- mea P4. Our results not only conﬁrm the potential for bioremediation of hydrocarbon contamination, butalso the ability to degrade other xenobiotic compounds and biotechnology potential, e.g. biosynthesis of compounds of industrial interest, such as frenolicin,nanaomycin and avilamycin antibiotics, the antitumor compound azinomycin, and rhamnolipids. Further- more, a complex metabolic network tuned to energyacquisition and biosynthesis of products of commer- cial interest was revealed.", "Materials and methods Strain and growth D. cinnamea strain P4 was previously isolated from samples of an acidic sandy loam (Cambisol) soil collected from an environmentally protected area of tropical Atlantic forest (Biological Reserve of Poc ¸o das Antas) located in Rio de Janeiro state, Brazil. It was cultivated and maintained in Luria–Bertani (LB; tryptone 1%, NaCl 0.5%, yeast extract 0.5%) mediumat 30/C176C under shaking up to exponential phase. Genomic DNA was obtained from strain P4 as described by Seldin and Dubnau ( 1985 ).", "Escherichia coli K12A15 wild-type is proﬁcient in all DNA repair/damage tolerance systems. This strain was used as a positive control in tests for cellularresistance to stressors (Nghiem et al. 1988 ). In contrast, E. coli BH980 ( mutY -) mutant strain is deﬁcient in base excision repair mediated by theMutY protein. It was used as the positive control in tests of spontaneous mutagenesis (Nghiem et al.", "Hydrocarbon degradation and growth experiments with D. cinnamea P4 were performed in minimal Bushnell Haas Broth (BHB), supplemented with theappropriate carbon source.

Samples from each bottle were taken on adaily basis to assess growth by CFU counting. All experiments were conducted in triplicate and at least two independent growth experiments were conducted for each carbon source. Growth experi- ments were also performed in 2-l bioreactors inaerobic conditions using 1 l of BHB supplemented with n-hexadecane at 1%. Here, we analyzed growth at pH 5–10, and temperatures from 25 to 45 /C176C.

Ultra- violet A (UV-A), ultraviolet B (UV-B) and ultravioletC (UV-C) were used as the stress factors, as follows. Cultures in the exponential growth phase (*2e8 CFU/ml in 10 ml LB) were centrifuged at 6,000 9gat 4/C176C, washed twice with phosphate buffer (PB), as described above. For UV-C, cell suspensions were irradiated with a General Electric 15-W germi-cidal lamp (G15T8, 254 nm) with increasing doses. After each treatment, aliquots were taken and plated on solid LB. Plates were incubated for 24–48 h andscored for remaining CFUs. UV strength was deter- mined by means of a Latarjet dosimeter. For UV-B, a VL215 lamp (312 nm) was used. The strength wasalso determined by using a VLX-3W dosimeter with a UV-B photocell.

After incubation at 30/C176C for 24–48 h, colonies were scored and mutation frequency was determined. Mutagenesis was expressed as the frequency of Rp mutants per 10 cells (Rp/108cells).", "Statistical analyses of survival and mutagenesis experiments The results are presented as means of at least three experiments with respective standard errors. Data were analyzed by ANOVA followed by the Student– Newman–Keuls multiple comparison test using thestatistical program InStat version 3.01 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA). A 5% level of signiﬁcance was adopted to evaluate the data.", "Pyrosequencing, genome analysis and annotation Pyrosequencing was performed (one run) on a FLX Roche apparatus at the University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark. Over 500,000 reads of goodquality were obtained. Following contig formation by automated software, the genome was automatically annotated, after which all annotation was manuallycontrolled and analyzed. The total of sequenced bases was 3,555,295 which correspond to about 99% of the D. cinnamea P4 genome. Predicted protein-encoding genes were identiﬁed using GLIMMER v3.02 (Del- cher et al. 2007 ) and EMBOSS for prokaryotes, followed by automatic annotation using search resultsagainst Pfam (Finn et al. 2010 ), Smart (Letunic et al. 2009 ), COG (Tatusov et al. 2003 ) and conserved Domains Database (CDD, Marchler-Bauer et al.2010 ) databases. Metabolic pathways found were categorized using the KEGG database. Transmem- brane domains were identiﬁed using TransportDB (Ren and Paulsen 2007 ) or THMMH (Krogh et al.", "2001 ) and SignalP was used to predict signal peptide regions (Emanuelsson et al. 2007 ). All annotation was done manually by using NCBI BLASTP against the non-redundant database. Orthologous genes wereidentiﬁed by cut-off scores of e \\10 identity. In addition, we only considered the putativeAntonie van Leeuwenhoek (2012) 101:289–302 291 genes of D. cinnamea P4 when they showed coverage of at least 30% with orthologous genes.

Ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes were detected by searching the whole genome sequence against rRNA databases with NCBIBLASTN and transfer RNAs by using tRNAscan- SE (Schattner et al. 2005 ). The G ?C content was determined by using the software EMBOSS (seewebsite). The total nucleotide sequence and annota- tion of D. cinnamea P4 is deposited in GenBank under accession no.

Bootstrap analysis was performed with 1,000 repetitions and scale barindicates the distance in substitutions per amino acids. Results and discussion Ecology and physiology of D. cinnamea P4 The habitat from which D. cinnamea strain P4 was isolated, a tropical rainforest soil (sandy loamCambisol; pH 5.5), revealed the presence of high levels of humic acids and heavy metals (Evans et al.", "2004 ). The forest soil further showed oxygen char- acteristics that rapidly ﬂuctuate between anaerobic/ microaerobic and aerobic conditions, as a result of rapid ﬂuctuations in moisture content. Hence, cellswere likely exposed to periodic ﬂuctuations in water and osmotic potential, impacting their physiology.", "Strain P4 was non-spore forming, non-motile and strictly aerobic. It was also able to grow at pH values up to 10 but not at pH below 6.0 and tempetures of25–40/C176C. Furthermore, it showed growth at NaCl concentrations in the range 0–10%. Assays of deg- radation of different petroleum hydrocarbons (e.g.hexadecane and benzene) revealed the ability of strain P4 to use compounds from oil and diesel, inparticular benzene and alkane compounds, as sole carbon sources (von der Weid et al. 2007 ).", "In order to evaluate the biological responses of strain P4 to environmental stresses conferred by physical and oxidative chemical mutagens, exponen- tial phase cultures (next to those of E. coli wild type strains K12A15 and BH980) were exposed to UV-A, UV-B and UV-C irradiations, as well as oxidative stress (using H", "2O2and CH). Surviving fractions in the", "treated populations were determined by using the ratio between the number of viable cells before and after each treatment (see Supporting information). D. cin- namea P4 revealed to be quite resistant to the stressors.", "In fact, it performed as well as, or better than, the E. coli wild type strains with all physical agents tested(P\\0.05), indicating that it is endowed with efﬁcient tolerance mechanisms. In particular, its resistance to UV-A was remarkable (Fig. 1). Regarding the muta- bility of strain P4, spontaneous mutation to Rp resistance occurred at the same level as that of E. coli K12A15. The latter strain is not considered to be amutator phenotype, especially when compared to strain BH980 (data not shown). Interestingly, strain P4 was extremely refractory to UV-A-induced muta-genesis, which was signiﬁcantly different from that of wild-type strain K12A15 ( P\\0.05). Whereas strain K12A15 revealed a 10.8-fold increase of mutation toRp after UV-A treatment, strain P4 displayed no increase in the frequency of Rp mutants. Under UV-B, P4 was quite susceptible to mutagenesis, but to a lesserextent than K12A15, both in terms of absolute numbers of Rp mutants as in fold increase ( P\\0.05). A similar response was observed between strains P4 andK12A15 after challenge with UV-C, and these two strains did not reveal the Rp mutant levels of the BH980 mutator strain. Overall, these data indicate thatDietzia cinnemea P4 is not a spontaneous mutator. It was particularly resistant to UV-induced mutagenesis, especially to the UV-A part of the solar UV spectrum.", "General genome featuresUsing high-coverage pyrosequencing on a FLX machine, we assembled the genome (coverage 30 9).", "The sequencing yielded 565,157 shotgun reads for a total of 3,555,295 nucleotides (Table 1). The resulting assembly ﬁnally consisted of 428 supercontigs, with alength range of [1 to 61 kb. Given the difﬁculty to completely close the genome (due to repeats and292 Antonie van Leeuwenhoek (2012) 101:289–302 extremely-high G ?C% regions), we focused on the roughly 3.5 Mb in 1 repllicon evidenced by pulse-ﬁeld gel electrophoresis, of sequence for annotation. Theaverage G ?C content of the genome was 70.9%, similar to that of the genomes of related actinomycetes, such as Rhodococcus jostii RHA1 and Nocardia farcinica IFM 10152 (Table 2).", "Similarity and domain searches showed that the D. cinnamea strain P4 genome contains 3,328 predicted protein-encoding genes (CDS). The puta- tive CDSs encode 2,665 proteins of known function,next to 389 conserved hypothetical proteins without function (source: NCBI, NR database and CDD). A total of 484 proteins were unique to D. cinnamea strain P4, with no signiﬁcant similarity to sequencesthat represent known functions in the database (Table 1).

The high number of genes devoted to different carbon acquisition pathways, coupled to the versatile pathways for degradation of hydrocar- bons and plant compounds, and elaborate stressresponse systems, indicated the presence of potential strategies that allow the survival and competitiveness of strain P4 in soil settings.

The high degree of similarity to genes of Rhodococcus is understandable given its taxonomic proximity. In fact, D. cinnamea strain P4 was initially classiﬁed as a member of the genus Rhodococcus (Evans et al. 2004 ).Alternative energy generation pathways In spite of the fact that gene annotations do not necessarily imply functionality, genome sequences of other bacteria have provided insights into keypotential functions. Thus, aerobic CO oxidizers have been uncovered, including several actinomycetes from soils (King and Weber 2007 ). We here indicate the presence of a CO oxidation pathway in the strain P4 genome by the identiﬁcation of genes that likelyencode the aerobic oxidation of CO to CO 2, which is catalyzed by the so-called carbon monoxide dehydro- genase complex (CODH). The genome of strain P4further revealed the presence of all genes for the large, medium and small subunits of this complex, i.e. the (Table S1). The distribution of these genes may differ between species (Santiago et al. 1999 ; Fuhrmann et al.", "2003 ; Pelzmann et al. 2009 ), however the typically clustered c oxSLM organization was indeed found in the strain P4 genome. Two forms of CODH, i.e. form I (which oxidizes CO) and form II (function unknown)have been described (King and Weber 2007 ). Our analysis also revealed that the large subunit of the Cox complex of strain P4 matched form I (Fig. 1S; Fig. 3).", "One putative accessory gene coxE (ZP_08022289) as well as a single xanthine and CODH maturation factor (xdhC/coxF —ZP_08023609) were also identiﬁed.", "The presence of accessory genes in addition to the CODH complex supports the proposition of Santiago et al. ( 1999 ), that the presence of coxaccessory genes is essential, with a CuMoO", "2metal centre, composed", "by the Cox complex, for complete CO oxidation.Table 2 Comparison between the D. cinnamea strain P4 genome and those other hydrocarbon degrader microorganisms Organism Size (Mb)a%G?CaRegulatorsaOxygenasesaTransport proteinsa Dietzia cinnamea P4 3.5b70.9 88 67 311 Rhodococcus jostii RHA1 9.7 67.0 705 203 890 Nocardia farcinica IFM 10152 6.3 70.8 448 96 838 Bulkholderia xenovorans LB400 9.7 62.6 745 134 1,139 Corynebacterium glutamicum ATCC 13032 3.3 65.6 148 27 402 Acinetobacter sp.

The ‘‘Others’’ column includes oxygenases, cell division,multidrug resistance and cell wall biogenesis proteins294 Antonie van Leeuwenhoek (2012) 101:289–302 The genome of D. cinnamea strain P4 also showed the possible use of nitrogenous organic compounds as terminal electron acceptors in oxygen-limiting con- ditions by dissimilatory nitrate reduction. The capac-ity to reduce NO 3-to NO 2-by strain P4 was suggested by the ﬁnding of large and small subunit membrane-bound NarGH complexes and the acces-sory soluble proteins NarIJ clustered in the narGHIJ operon (ZP_08022539–42). In addition, we found a single gene moaA (ZP_08022534), one moaE moeA1 (ZP_08024513), and a single copy of moaC / mogC (ZP_08022523). These genes clustered together with a gene for multicopper oxidase, CopA (ZP_08022537), which is involved in the synthesis of molybdenum cofactor, and is essential for nitrate reductase activities (Moreno-Vivia ´n et al. 1999 ). The supply of nitrate for use by the NarGH omplex in thereduction reaction is probably performed by the ABC-type transporter NarK (ZP_08022543, ZP_08024598), which clustered along the narGHIJ operon, and a second copy which was localized in another site in the strain P4 chromosome.", "Autotrophic carbon ﬁxation The energy generated and conserved via aerobic CO oxidation can be directed to ﬁx CO", "2into biomole-", "cules. In strain P4, this may proceed by two different mechanisms, i.e. via the reductive TCA cycle (rTCA)and/or the 3-hydroxypropionate cycle. Here, we found evidence for the ability of strain P4 to employ both metabolic pathways by the presence of the main genes that are required for them (Table S1).", "Although these cycles are prevalent among anaer- obic bacteria, e.g. inhabitants of hydrothermal vents, in actinomycete species it was shown that the keyenzymes for autotrophic CO", "2ﬁxation can operate", "under microaerophilic conditions, sometimes using sulﬁde or hydrogen as the preferred electron donors(Rothschild 2008 ). Our genome analysis revealed the presence of the multisubunit pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase (ZP_08023401), phosphoenolpyr-uvate synthase (ZP_08024792) and phosphoenolpyr- uvate carboxylase (ZP_08025255), which are indicative for the presence of this branch of the TCA cycle, in addition to both 2-oxoglutarate:ferre- doxin oxidoreductase subunits (ZP_08023094–5),isocitrate lyase (ZP_08022794) and citrate lyase (ZP_08024811). The latter are both constituents of the normal TCA cycle, but operating in reverse mode.Autotrophic CO", "2ﬁxation by the 3-hydroxypropionate", "cycle, which was ﬁrst described for Chloroﬂexus aurantiacus (Eisenreich et al. 1993 ; Herter et al.", "2001 ), is possible by a reaction in which two molecules of CO 2are converted into glyoxylate by action of the large biotin-dependent acetyl/propionyl-CoA carboxylase enzyme and malonyl-CoA reduc- tase. In the strain P4 genome, we found one cluster of genes containing malonyl-CoA reductase next to Fig. 3 Phylogenetic relationship between aminoacid sequence D. cinnamea P4 and the sequences of form I and II large CODH proteins (CoxL) of related organismsAntonie van Leeuwenhoek (2012) 101:289–302 295 genes for both subunits of acetyl/propionyl-CoA carboxylase (ZP_08022855–57), and the complete pathway for the biosynthesis of biotin compounds(see below). Besides these results, we assessed the utilization of CO", "2at different concentrations as the", "sole carbon source to spur the growth of strain P4 (seesupporting information). The ability of D. cinnamea strain P4 to use C1 compounds as energy and carbon sources is sug-gested by our ﬁnding of genes involved in formate oxidation and formaldehyde transfer (CH", "2O). In", "formate oxidation, there are two possible mecha-nisms: formate can be taken up from the environment by the ABC transport system and subsequently become oxidized to CO", "2by the formate dehydroge-", "nase complex, which is encoded by the fdhABD genes 1997 ). The second mechanism utilizes formaldehyde as the substrate, which can be converted to formate by the bifunctional enzyme 5,10-methylene-tetrahy- drofolate dehydrogenase/methenyl tetrahydrofolatecyclohydrolase (ZP_08022869). The subsequent reaction catalyzes the oxidation of formate to CO by the formate dehydrogenase complex (Eisenreich et al. 1993 ). The formaldehyde transfer mechanism involves the participation of three different metabolic cycles: serine, glyoxylate regeneration and poly- b- hydroxy isobutyryl-CoA (PHB) cycles, with genes overlapping between distinct pathways. This complex mechanism found in the strain P4 genome is similarto the one described in Methylobacterium extorquens strain AM1 (Chistoserdova et al. 2003 ). This strain utilizes tetrahydrofolate (H", "4F) as a cofactor and 5,10-", "methylene-tetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase/methenyl tetrahydrofolate cyclohydrolase catalyzes the forma- tion of methylene-H 4F from formaldehyde and H 4F.", "Moreover, it is directed to C1 assimilation cycles by the serine, glyoxylate regeneration and PHB cycles (Table S1).", "Hydrocarbon metabolismAlkane compounds are the most abundant compo- nents of crude oil, making up over 50% of total oilmass. Alkane molecules are chemically rather inert, but in the presence of O", "2they can be activated by", "oxygenases and directed to complete oxidation (vanBeilen et al. 2001 ). In a previous study, strain P4 showed to be capable of degrading differentcompounds present in crude oil, such as differently- sized alkanes (C-11 up to C-36) and aromatic hydrocarbons (von der Weid et al. 2007 ). In the current genome analysis, we identiﬁed one gene cluster containing genes for enzymes that are likely involved in n-alkane degradation. These encom- passed one TetR family transcriptional regulator (ZP_08022270) and one alkane 1-monooxygenase- rubredoxin (Rub) fusion protein (ZP_08022271). Wealso noted the presence of the gene for a lipid transporter (ZP_08022272), which clusters with the previous genes. In agreement with the phylogeneticrelatedness of the putative transcriptional regulator TetR with AlkS transcriptional regulators of several actinomycetes, this suggested a likely regulatoryfunction of ZP_08022270 in the alkane biodegrada- tion pathway (Canosa et al. 2000 ). The putative monooxygenase region revealed 96% amino acididentity with the alkane hydroxylase-Rub fusion protein of Dietzia sp. E1. A comparison with the THMMH database indicated that the protein encodedby this gene contains six transmembrane loops, which is similar to other AlkB proteins. The Rub region protein, which is involved in electron transfer,showed similarity with the RubA protein of other actinomycetes.", "Analysis of the P4 genome further conﬁrmed the presence of genes encoding enzymes involved in the biphenyl and benzoate degradation pathways. One chromosomal region was identiﬁed, which was foundto contain the 2,3-dihydrobiphenyl 1,2-dioxygenase, bphB (ZP_08022749), 2,3-dihydroxybiphenyl 1,2- dioxygenase, bphC (ZP_08022738, ZP_0802 4903) and 2-hydroxy-6-oxo-6-phenylhexa-2,4-dieno- ate hydrolase, bphD (ZP_08024298) genes. These three genes make part of the upper biphenyl pathway.In addition, we found a LysR transcriptional regulator (ZP_08022766) clustering with these genes, indicat- ing involvement in the regulation of expression of thebphBCD operon. The metabolites resulting from the upper pathway are 2-hydroxy-penta-2,4-dienoate and benzoate. The ﬁrst compound can be converted to TCA intermediates by the lower biphenyl pathway, which is encoded by bphEFG genes that were also benzoate is converted to catechol by the benzoate dioxygenase complex, benABC (ZP_08023230–32), which is directed to the catechol branches of the b-ketoadipate central pathway (Table S1) (Gonc ¸alves296 Antonie van Leeuwenhoek (2012) 101:289–302 et al. 2006 ; McLeod et al. 2006 ). In addition, two genes probably encoding MFS family benzoate transporters were found (ZP_08022153), which sup-ports the importance of this pathway for strain P4. Other oxygenasesOxygenases are enzymes that catalyze the insertion of oxygen atoms from O 2into an organic substrate.", "They consist of two types: enzymes that catalyze the insertion of a single oxygen atom, monooxygenases, and enzymes that catalyze the insertion of twooxygen atoms, dioxygenases. Reactions in which organic compounds are oxygenated have great value for organic synthesis, thus there is great interest ofbiotechnology industries. Genomic analysis of P4 revealed the presence of 45 monooxygenases and 22 dioxygenases (Table S2). The number of oxygenasespresent in the D. cinnamea strain P4 genome is relatively high, as judged by comparing the number of oxygenases per Mb across the genomes of differentspecies (Table S2). R. josti RHA1 and Burkholderia xenovorans LB400, strains known to have large numbers of oxygenases in their genomes, have 20.9and 13.8 oxygenases per Mb respectively, while strain P4 has 19.1. The number of cytochrome P450 genes in the strain P4 genome was nine, which is inline with that in other actinomycetes (Mongodin et al. 2006 ). Among the cytochrome P450 of strain P4, genes encoding linalool monooxygenase and cypXstood out. Both are involved in secondary metabolism (Table S2).", "We identiﬁed coding genes for the enzyme 3-keto 9-b-hydroxylase, which is responsible for opening the ring of cholesterol compounds. In addition, we noted two coding genes for cholesterol oxidase. There aretwo different classes of cholesterol oxidase, each with two subclasses. Class I contains the FAD cofactor non-covalently bound to the enzyme; this class occursmainly in actinomycetes. Class II contains the cofac- tor covalently linked to the enzyme, with Gram- negative bacteria as main representatives. The strain P4 genome was found to contain two different cholesterol oxidases of class I (ZP_08024621,ZP_08025358). Phylogenetic and similarity analyses suggested that CDSs ZP_08025358 and ZP_08024621 were distant from each other, being the ﬁrst similar toclass I-1, and the second to class I-2. The latter lacks a signal sequence, suggesting cytoplasmic localization(Navas et al. 2001 ). In addition, strain P4 also possessed genes described for catabolic pathways:", "speciﬁcally, genes encoding lactate monooxygenase,dimethylalanine monooxygenase, glycolate oxidase and lysine/ornithine monooxygenase (Table S2).", "Secondary metabolism The genome sequence of strain P4 revealed genes coding for the biosynthesis of terpene compounds, non-ribosomal peptide and polyketide synthases (PKS), which were distributed non-uniformly overthe strain P4 genome. We found genes of the so-called DOXP/MEP pathways of terpenoid backbone biosyn- thesis, responsible for the synthesis of geranyl biphos-phate and undecaprenyl diphosphate compounds quently, the geranyl can be converted into (S)-carvone by limonene 6-monooxygenase and carveol dehydro-genase genes (ZP_08023075, ZP_08024532). The full pathway for L-rhamnose biosynthesis was L-rhamnose is a component of cell walls of pathogens which spurs virulence, and so this charac-teristic might confer virulence characteristics on this bacterium. We also found the complete pathway for the secondary carotenoid metabolite that is probablyconnected to UV-resistance (see below). We identiﬁed 10 putative PKSs of PKS type II, and a single regulator of PKS expression(ZP_08022881). PKSs catalyze a decarboxylative condensation of simple metabolites like acetate, malonate, propionate, butyrate and their derivativesinto growing polyketide chains (van der Ploeg et al. 2001 ). Microbial PKSs are divided into three major types. The PKS type I system consists of one or moremultifuntional proteins that contain a different active site for each modiﬁcation. PKS type II comprises individual proteins for the synthesis of aromatic products. PKS type III is composed of homodimers grouped in the synthase superfamily. In addition,there is an atypical PKS type, which catalyzes iterative condensation of extenders in a polyketide chain, called iterative type I PKS. We deduced thepresence of two coding genes that likely catalyze the synthesis of new antibiotics: a gene homologous toAntonie van Leeuwenhoek (2012) 101:289–302 297 aviGT4 , the product of which is responsible for the synthesis of avilamycin A (ZP_08024273), and a gene homologous to ncnH , possibly involved in biosynthesis of the aromatic antibiotic naphthocycli- none (ZP_08022739). The latter antibiotic exhibits activity against Gram-positive bacteria (Sthapit et al.2004 ). The genome annotation further identiﬁed a single copy of a gene for naphthoate synthase (ZP_08024639), a component of the interactive typeI PKS family that participates in the biosynthetic pathway of Azinomycin B, a complex natural poly- ketide with strong antitumor activity (Bru ¨nke et al.", "Stress responses and DNA repair mechanismsThe strain P4 genome showed elaborate systems that allow tolerance to environmental stresses. Also, multi-ple DNA repair mechanisms were found. Strain P4 may resist reactive oxygen radicals [produced by redox reactions in aerobic metabolism] using two superoxidedismutases, namely one SodA (ZP_08023526) and a single Cu–Zn SodC (ZP_08021853). Furthermore, two peroxidases (ZP_08023084, ZP_08021854) may be involved. We also noted the transcriptional regulatorOxyR (ZP_08023122), which—at high levels of hydrogen peroxide (H", "2O2)—activates the detoxifying", "enzyme alkyl peroxidase (ZP_08023120).", "The strain P4 genome was further found to contain genes involved in thiol redox control, e.g. thioredoxin 08024653) and thioredoxin reductase (ZP_08023294, ZP_08023504, ZP_08024475), glutathione peroxidase(ZP_08023200, ZP_08024106), glutathione reductase (ZP_08022216) and glutathione S-transferase (ZP_ 08024195). Also, we found the organic hydroperoxideresistance gene (ZP_08023119–20), which is involved in detoxifying organic oxidative agents and methio- nine sulfoxide reductase (ZP_08023523). In addition, we detected a gene cluster composed of genes homol- ZP_08023534, ZP_08025308). This cluster is likely expressed under conditions of iron starvation and oxidative stress, working in protection or repair of [Fe–S] proteins (Zhao et al. 2008 ). Another important system involved in the acquisition of iron present in thegenome of D. cinnamea strain P4 is the ABC sidero- phore transport system (Table S1).", "Strain P4 probably repairs damage to its DNA through nucleotide excision, as evidenced by the ﬁnding of uvrA ,uvrBC and uvrD -like helicases, genes for DNA alkylation repair and DNA glycosy-lases. Furthermore, pyrimidine dimer resolving enzymes, e.g. photo lyase, and recombination repair proteins— ruvAB and recAB —were found. Also, other components of the recombination apparatus, recNOQ , and other enzymes of Holliday junction resolution were found. Four copies of the Nudixfamily of genes (which has as a role in cleaning the cell of toxic nucleotide metabolites), were found. In addition, we noted the presence of phytoene synthe-tase (ZP_08023983), phytoene dehydrogenase 08022078) and lycopene elongase (ZP_08024381)genes. These genes compose the b-carotene biosyn- thesis pathway, which is suggested to confer radiation resistance by scavenging electrons from reactiveoxygen species (Bessman et al. 1996 ). The ability of D. cinnamea P4 to protect itself from toxic effects of heavy metals was evidenced bythe 32 putative coding genes identiﬁed that are potentially involved in conferring resistance against these compounds (Table S1). Genes for arsenicresistance (through extrusion) and inactivation by reduction were localized at two different sites in the genome. The ﬁrst was a region composed of genes foran arsenite export protein (ZP_08022909) and two arsenate reductases (ZP_08022908, ZP_08023703), the second contained two transport systems intandem, probably involved as an efﬂux pump of arsenic compounds (ZP_08023621). Also, genes for mercury resistance were detected: one putative mer-cury reductase protein (ZP_08021869) and one transporter system involved in heavy metal translo- cation (ZP_08023622). Interestingly, two transcrip-tional regulators were found to be localized at different sites in the genome (ZP_08021962, ZP_08024385), beside other transport systems involved in heavy metal translocation, such as copper, zinc and cadmium. Although we found threecopies of terC genes (ZP_08025049, ZP_08025084, ZP_08025329), responsible for resistance to tellurium ions, other genes involved in this, e.g. terBDE , were missing. Resistance to copper was associated with the presence of the sensor genes copRS (ZP_08023436–7)298 Antonie van Leeuwenhoek (2012) 101:289–302 and c usS (ZP_08022249), two copies of copper- translocating P-type ATPase copA (ZP_08024603, This suggested one mechanism of copper trafﬁcking, triggered by redox-dependent coordination properties of the metal (Phillips et al. 2002 ). In spite of some metals being necessary for cell homeostasis, a single gene coding for a protein involved in the efﬂux of iron was detected, which probably has a role in theresistance to iron at high concentrations. Another seven ATPase efﬂux transporter systems for cad- mium, cobalt and zinc were found in the P4 genome,showing the importance of metal resistance for strain P4 ecology (Table S1).", "The genome information further showed that strain P4 may sense osmotic stress by virtue of an osmolarity sensor protein (ZP_08022040), after which a response is triggered. The internal osmoticequilibrium is probably maintained by accumulation of organic osmolytes (compatible solute strategy), which are synthesized by the enzymes cholinedehydrogenase (ZP_08024621) and betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase (ZP_08023435). We also noted the presence of genes encoding transport mechanisms forthese compounds (ZP_08024080–82, ZP_08024126, we identiﬁed the so-called ehuA gene, which is involved in the uptake of extracellular ectoine compounds (ZP_08022970). Intracellular accumula- tion of trehalose and glycogen has been reportedunder water stress conditions. The genes in the strain P4 genome responsible for trehalose biosynthesis from glycogen were found to be clustered in thetreYXZ operon (ZP_08022640, ZP_08022646–47). TreX is a glycogen-debranching enzyme, yielding 1,4-a-glucan compounds, TreY reduces the end of 1,4-a-glucan to form trehalose residues and TreZ liberates trehalose from the product of the TreY- catalyzed reaction (Arnesano et al. 2003 ). In addition, the presence of an aquaporine Z gene (ZP_08024724) suggests the role of control of water movement in efforts to osmotic stress tolerance.", "One of the desirable characteristics in a strain with potential for bioremediation/biocatalysis is toleranceto solvents. Strain P4 is able to grow in oil, diesel, benzene and alkanes (von der Weid et al. 2007 ). This tolerance is probably due to the presence of anABC transporter system encoded by the ttgABC operon (ZP_08024403–11). These genes may beconstitutively expressed, as their control is normally accomplished by the transcriptional repressor ttgR, which we could not ﬁnd in the genome annotation.The genome of strain P4 further possesses universal stress-related proteins (USPs) (ZP_08022937, ZP_08023009, ZP_0802386, ZP_08025031), whichare involved in a wide variety of responses to environmental stress, such as carbon, nitrogen and phosphate starvation, exposure to heat shock and UVradiation. Also, we found the gene for the transcrip- tional regulator of heat shock, HcrA (ZP_0802 ZP_08023540), c lpBCX (encoding chaperonins) Among the genes that are potentially involved in survival and adaptation of strain P4 in soil, a widerepertoire of antibiotic resistance genes was found. In total, 12 genes encoding B and C classes of beta- lactamases and penicillin biosynthesis were found,next to at least 12 putative ATP-ABC and 10 MFS transport systems (Table S1). The latter are likely involved in the efﬂux of drugs like enterobactin(ZP_08023706) and daunorubicin (ZP_08024809). We found four copies of genes coding for ami- are involved in the modiﬁcation/efﬂux of neomycin and kanamycin, next to two genes involved inexport of polyketide antibiotics (ZP_08023291, ZP_08025214). One gene coding for the radical SAM 23-S rRNA methyltransferase of the Cfr family(ZP_08022226) was found. This is thought to perform post-transcriptional modiﬁcation of rRNA, thus conferring resistance to ribosome-targeting anti-biotics (Kaminska et al. 2010 ). Also, we identiﬁed a single copy of a gene for erythromycin esterase (ZP_08022936), which presents a likely role against the action of this antibiotic.", "Transport of molecules Analysis of the strain P4 genome using the THMMH, NR, CDD and TransportDB databases revealed the presence of about 311 CDSs with putative transport roles (Table S1). This value represents about 8.8% ofthe whole strain P4 genome, which is consistent withAntonie van Leeuwenhoek (2012) 101:289–302 299 values from other sequenced actinomycete genomes.", "The best-represented transporter class was the ABC family (49%), followed by the MFS family (13%). Inboth families, the presence of genes involved in drug export, solvent and metal efﬂux stood out. This may reﬂect a requirement for these systems in anenvironment like soil, where the presence of antibi- otic producers is likely. Hence, the ability to compete in the niche is enhanced by the use of efﬁcientantibiotic efﬂux systems next to the synthesis of own antimicrobials. In addition to the uptake transporters described above, the strain P4 genome containsseveral genes for permeases for diverse sugar classes, glycerol, nucleosides, amino acids, acetate, urea, vitamin B12 and C4-dicarboxylate. The secADEFY genes (Table S1), which encode the Type II secretion system, were also detected in strain P4 genome. The tatAC translocase genes (Table S1) were also found.", "They encode a component of the Sec-independent protein translocation system, which is involved in translocation of folded proteins across the periplas-mic membrane. Concluding remarks The tropical soil from which D. cinnamea P4 was isolated is characterized as a complex environment with frequent chemical and physical inputs. The resulting energy ﬂux is mainly due to the primaryproduction, which is reﬂected in root exudation as well as in the decomposition of plant parts. The current annotation of the strain P4 genome assists usin gaining new insights in the mechanisms employed byD. cinnamea P4 in its adaptation to soil. The presumably saprophytic lifestyle of D. cinnamea P4 is reﬂected in the complex network of gene products involved in the acquisition of carbon, as well as in the seemingly efﬁcient processes of protection againstenvironmental stress. The diverse array of ABC- and MFS-like transporters, which are predicted to be involved in the acquisition of different materials from soil, next to the complex catabolic mechanisms for the (simultaneous) use of plant compounds likelimone, pinene, alkane/alkanesulfonate, cyclic alkanes, nitrogen compounds and complex carbohy- drates, highlights the strategies for growth andsurvival in a complex habitat. The genome sequencealso conﬁrmed the existence of pathways for the transformation of aromatic and phenolic compounds which are generated following decomposition ofplant materials. Here, the assimilation of aromatic compounds like biphenyl, benzoate and phenol converge to the common b-ketoadipate pathway.", "The ability to use aerobic CO oxidization and a possible anaerobic dissimilatory nitrate reduction pathway as energy generation mechanisms, and theﬁxation of CO 2, support the capacity to grow autotrophically. However, an aerobic heterotrophic lifestyle may predominate in the organism. The harshclimate can be inhospitable to microorganisms dwelling in tropical soils, as alternating periods of drought and high humidity, high sun incidenceraising the temperature, and the presence of chemi- cals constitute typical stressors. Another factor of importance for the ﬁtness of strain P4 is the highnumber of genes devoted to a rapid response to stress signals. Strain P4 was shown to possess elaborate systems for osmotic stress control, also revealing thecomplete pathway for synthesis of carotenoid com- pounds that confer UV and oxidative stress resis- tance. Moreover, the multiplicity of genes devoted toantibiotic resistance in the P4 genome reveals the importance of drug tolerance in its habitat.", "Finally, the D. cinnamea P4 genome was found to encode a high number of enzymes with potential application in biocatalysis. Oxygenases involved in secondary metabolite biosynthesis, e.g. of carveolcompounds and genes for the biosynthesis of aro- matic antibiotics exemplify some products of com- mercial interest.

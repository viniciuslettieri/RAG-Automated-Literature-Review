A study of gluten -free cereal -based cake premixes . Rio de Janeiro, 2020. Thesis (Doctorate in Engineering of Chemical and Biochemical Processes) – School of Chemistry, Federal University of Rio de Janeiro , Rio de Janeiro, Sorghum represents an essential crop for human use, with an increasing world population and decreasin g water supplies. Nevertheless, there are few industrialized foods made with this gluten -free (GF) cereal to reach more people arou nd the world. So , food innovation is essential to expand the range of sorghum -based products available to consumers, main ly because, in general, GF products are inferi or in quality. The beneficial effects of a healthy diet on the quality of life become the nutritional and the functional values crucial aspects of GF products. Moreover, sensory analysis is indispensable to promote the project of developing sorghum -based products and, therefore, work on sensory profiles of these products and consumer acceptance is needed to help them succeed. Due to a lack of GF ingredients, the first part of this Thesis aimed to obtain GF flours wi th sustainable claim, achieved by i) the usage of a drought -tolerant cereal (sorghum) and of food industry wastes (orange pomace and whey protein, which can nutritionally and technologically impr ove the utilization of sorghum), and ii) the adoption of a pr ocess that does not generate residue (thermoplastic extrusion). A central composite rotational design was employed to study the impact of changing the total amount of whole -grain sorghum flour, the conditioning moisture in composite flour , and the temperat ure in the third zone of the extruder on the energy expenditure of the process and flour properties. Pregelatinized GF composite flours with similar pasting properties to cross -linked chemically modified sorghum starches were obtained. The results indicate the perspective of offering both the food industry and customers new GF cereal flours, with excellent technological characteristics and sustainable claim. Subsequently, the simplex -centroid mixture design was used to evaluate the effect of red sorghum whole -grain, polished rice, and pregelatinized composite flours on technological (oven spring, specific volume, volume, symmetry, and uniformity indexes, firmness , and sprin giness), nutritional (protein, lipid, ash, total dietary fiber and carbohydrates contents , and in vitro protein digestibility) , and functional (total phenolic content and antioxidant capacities) properties of GF cakes made from cake premixes. Pregelatinized composite flour was shown to be a possible option to retain food safety and technological aspects of cake premixes. All GF cakes in this Thesis can be labeled as protein and dietary fiber sources, besides being enriched in bioactive compounds. Finally, this Thesis investigated the acceptance of 5 optimized GF sorghum -based and a Reference (with gluten) cakes (prepared from cake premixes), considering their drivers of liking and disliking and their purchase intention. Chocolate - and orange -flavo red GF cakes were develop ed based on the numerical optimizations of the formulations (technological, nutritional, functional, technological and nutritional, and technological and functional optimizations). Three sensory evaluation techniques were applied t o cakes: acceptance testing, purchase intention , and Check -all-that-apply. There was an improvement in the sensory properties of the GF samples in which the nutritional or functional characteristics were optimized together with the technological characteri stics, resulting in higher acceptances. It was confirmed that sensory studies are indispensable to confront the challenge of developing sorghum -based foods with sensory characteristics desired by consumers. Therefore, it is concluded that it was possible t o offer a GF cake premix that presents good sensory quality, having the potential to be offered as a novelty by the food industry, given that most consumers stated that they did not know sorghum.", "Keywords: Orange pomace.

However, eating healthy is still a big challenge for many consumers, as 20% of Brazilians detect it challenging to find healthy and tasty products and 34% claim that a modern lifestyle makes it difficult to be healthy (MINTEL, 2017a). It is often proposed that today’s food consumption in industrialized soci eties is mainly affected by three significant trends: health concerns, sustainability, and convenience (GRUNERT, 2013). It is important to offer food products where consumers save time in the cooking process without, however, sacrificing a key element: bal anced nutrition (MINTEL, 2017b).", "In the bakery sector, one of the fastest -growing categories is whole -grain, with the latest releases showing variations through the incorporation of whole -grains, ancestral grains, multigrain, concentrated fibers, plant so urces of antioxidants, etc. (QUEIROZ; REGO; JARDIM, 2014). In this context, it is essential to highlight that sorghum, the cereal proposed in this study, is still little consumed in Brazil and is present only in artisanal formulations (QUEIROZ, 2013 apud RIBAS, 2014). Notwithstanding, it is already widely used in resource -poor or developing countries (YOUSIF; NHEPERA; JOHNSON, 2012; BORÉM; PIMENTEL; PARELLA, 2014; RIBAS, 2014), providing an excellent base for gluten -free (GF) bread, cakes, snacks and pasta (TAYLOR; SHOBER; BEAN, 2006). Because it is free of gluten -forming proteins, sorghum has a great potential to be inserted in the diet of individuals with celiac disease (QUEIROZ et al., 2009), those non -celiac and/or with other gluten -related disorders con sumers of GF products. Extrusion is an industrial process used in sorghum processing to improve the nutritional efficiency of this cereal, as it increases its exposure to enzymatic action during digestion (DUODU et al., 2003; RIBAS, 2014).", "Another rising f ood category is GF, which has surprisingly crossed the line of celiac disease through widespread dissemination in weight loss diets. This food section is gaining an increasingly robust market through the communication of claims that bring the perception of a healthier and safe product (QUEIROZ; REGO; JARDIM, 2014). In contrast, the researchers’ efforts demonstrate that a GF diet may not be the most appropriate in terms of protein and dietary fiber, for instance.", "According to the 2008 -2009 Household Budget S urvey, 74% of Brazilian people aged ten and over have inadequate dietary fiber intake (RIO DE JANEIRO, 2011). In general, fruits’ dietary fiber concentrates have better nutritional quality compared to those isolated from cereals (JIMÉNEZ -ESCRIG et al., 200 1; CHAU; HUANG, 2003; LARIO et al ., 2004; ARVANITOYANNIS; VARZAKAS, 2008). Hence, Brazil’s orange juice industry, which is the largest in the world, can provide excellent fiber - enriched raw material, that is present in the fruit residues after juice remova l, corresponding to approximately 50% of the total orange mass (VAN BOEKEL, 2012). Another by -product of the food industry that can be used as a high nutritional value functional ingredient is whey (IEA, 2013), which is in the GRAS (Generally Recognized as Safe) substance category (KRISSANSEN, 2007). Whey is a by -product of the dairy industry that has a high environmental pollution factor if discarded without previous treatment in soil and rivers (PILER; TAKEITI, 2011). About 8 kg of whey is produced in eve ry 1 kg of cheese made (SANTIAGO, 2013). The employment of this by-product in food manufacturing can reduce the disposal of waste in the environment and improve the nutritional quality of food products concomitantly.", "1.2 Project Justification", "The importanc e to simultaneously improve both the quality and the nutritional profile of GF products has been stimulating researchers to investigate new ingredients and technologies to be applied in GF bakery products.", "Overall, consumers are increasingly looking for he althy, innovative, convenient, reliable, and tasty foods. In this framework, a cake premix without the addition of gluten -forming proteins, containing fibers, and proteins with high biological value may attract the attention of consumers of the above niche , as well as those with gluten - related disorders.", "Sorghum is a valuable cereal for human consumption, as it demands few water resources and nutrients, and its production cost is low. Also, it contains higher levels of polyphenolic compounds than other more commonly consumed cereals.", "Approximately 75% of the Brazilian population does not have the necessary daily intake of dietary fiber. Thus, it is pertinent to add these compounds to food product formulations. Orange has been chosen as the source of these fi bers, as Brazil is the world’s largest producer of orange juice and, consequently, has a large amount of very", "rich waste in those substances. This by -product has a high potential for use in the food industry, reducing in parallel, the deposition of solid w aste. Whey, which is a by -product of the cheese industry, has proteins of high biological value, with potential in the development of innovative and nutritious products.", "Therefore, developing a product that is both rich in dietary fiber (which becomes from an agro -industrial process and whole -grain cereal) and in protein (which also comes from an industrial by -product) can be a promising alternative for sustainable food production.", "1.3 General Objective", "The general objective of the present Thesis is the stu dy of GF cereal -based cake premixes, with better technological, nutritional, and sensory profiles.", "1.4 Specific Objectives", " To examine variations in the quantities of sorghum flour and orange pomace flour in the suitability for the composition of a GF prege latinized composite flour applicable to cake production;  To evaluate thermoplastic extrusion process parameters for the production of a GF pregelatinized composite flour suitable for cake production;  To analyze the technological characteristics of GF flours produced by varying their composition in quantities of sorghum flour and orange pomace flour and conditions of the extrusion process;  To study the formulation of GF cereal -based cake premixes made with whole - grain sorghum flour, polished rice flour, and pregelatinized composite flour;  To measure the technological, nutritional, and functional profiles of GF batter high ratio type cakes made from the premixes;  To optimize the formulations of the GF cereal -based cake premixes in terms of the technological, nutritional and functional attributes;  To investigate the acceptance of optimized GF cereal -based cakes;  To examine the drivers of liking and disliking of the optimized GF cereal -based cakes and their purchase intention.", "References ARVANI TOYANNIS, I.S.; VARZAKAS, T.H..

It is assumed that gluten means wheat pro teins that are insoluble in salt solutions: gliadins and glutenins (LESZCZYNSKA, 2009). Prolamins, which are defined as the fraction from gluten that can be extracted by 40 –70% aqueous ethanol, are the gluten components responsible for the immune -mediated response. They are found in specific cereals: wheat (gliadin), rye (secalin), barley (hordein), some cultivars of oats (avenin) and their derivatives (PIETZAK; FASANO, 2005; CELIAC DISEASE FOUNDATION, 2013 ; DI CAIRANO et al., 2018) and their content in gluten is generally taken as 50%. Gluten and related proteins found in grains contribute to a cluster of diseases, not limited to celiac disease (O’BRYAN; FORD; KUPPER, 2012). Underneath the umbrella of gluten -related disorders, there are also people with wheat allergy, non - celiac gluten sensitivity, dermatitis herpetiformis and gluten ataxia (O’BRYAN; FORD; KUPPER, 2012; FOSCHIA et al., 2016). For them, gluten could also be considered a “toxin” based upon its mechanism of action in the small bowel and perh aps even in the central nervous system (PIETZAK; FASANO, 2005). Besides the people needing to follow a GF diet for health reasons, a new segment of consumers has arisen who consume GF products as a lifestyle choice (FOSCHIA et al., 2016).", "Gluten -related di sorders -inducing cereals are in the Triticeae group (Figure 1). Oats, the most closely related, is safe for the vast majority of celiac (and related) patients; however, the main practical problem is cross -contamination with other cereals during manufacture (THOMPSON, 2004). Other cereals are distantly related and are safe to be part of a GF food formulation (HOWDLE, 2010).", "Figure 1 - Taxonomic relationships of cereal grains", "Source: Adapted from HOWDLE, 2010.", "According to the CODEX Alimentarius (FAO/WHO, 2008), GF foods “are dietary foods: a) consisting of or made only from one or more ingredients which do not contain wheat (i.e. all Triticum species, such as durum wheat, spelt, and khorasan wheat, which is als o marketed under different trademarks such as KAMUT), rye, barley, oats or their crossbred varieties, and the gluten level does not exceed 20 mg/kg in total, based on the food as sold or distributed to the consumer, and/or b) consisting of one or more ingr edients from wheat (i.e. all Triticum species, such as durum wheat, spelt, and khorasan wheat, which is also marketed under different trademarks such as KAMUT), rye, barley, oats or their crossbred varieties, which have been specially processed to remove g luten, and the gluten level does not exceed 20 mg/kg in total, based on the food as sold or distributed to the consumer”.", "An enzyme -linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) has been developed for the detection of gluten in food. In this test, the lower limit of wheat gluten detection is 0.016%. From this method, studies began to emerge on the concentration of celiac - tolerated gluten intakes, both in daily intake (10 mg of gliadin) and in protein concentration in foods (220 ppm). It should be noted that the thresh old dose varies from one individual to another (TAYLOR; HEFLE, 2005) .", "In GF products, wheat flour is mainly substituted with rice or maize flour and commercial starches, resulting in products with poor nutritional quality and low acceptability (LEE et al ., 2007). There is an excellent question of improving the nutritional profile of products that do not contain gluten -forming protein, as this", "category is generally low in dietary fiber, for instance. Moreover, it remains a challenge for food processors to re plicate the taste and aroma similar to gluten -containing counterpart (PACYŃSKI; WOJTASIAK; MILDNER -SZKUDLARZ, 2015) and also surpass their commonly less desirable appearance and dry and sandy textures (RAMOS; PIEMOLINI -BARRETO; SANDRI, 2012; GAO et al., 2018). Consumers, food manufacturers, and health professionals are uniquely influenced by the growing popularity of the GF diet. Consumer expectations have urged the food industry to continuously adjust and improve the formulations and processing techniques used in GF products manufacturing (KHOURY; BALFOUR -DUCHARME; JOYE, 2018).", "Novel approaches, including the application of dietary fibers and alternative protein sources combined with response surface methodology, are emerging in the manufacture of GF bakery products (GALLAGHER; GORMLEY; ARENDT, 2004).", "The main objectives of dietary fiber enrichment in GF products are to enhance the nutritional value, improve techno -functional characteristics, and increase sensory appeal. The adoption of compositional and tec hnological approaches can assist in the production of GF products enriched with dietary fiber exhibiting desirable properties and lower cost (ARSLAN et al ., 2019). GF formulations can also include dairy ingredients, such as whey protein concentrate and whey protein isolate (VAN RIEMSDIJK et al., 2011) that are known for both nutritional and technological benefits (BADIU; APRODU; BANU, 2014). Another possibl e strategy to increase the nutritional value of GF products is to include nutritionally valued flours, such as ancient cereals, pseudocereals, root and tubers, and leguminous flours (ROSELL; MATOS, GF products are in the free-from category, in which interest grows alongside safe, healthy, and sustainable foods. This expansion is far beyond those people who must follow specific diets: 30% of Brazilian adults would like to see a broader range of free- from products available and 10% of Brazilians say that the presence of wheat or gluten in the product is a barrier to consumption of bread and baked goods (MINTEL, 2017). The GF products market was valued at USD 4.18 billion in 2017 and is projected to reach USD 6.47 billion by 2023 (MARKETSANDMARKETS, 2019 ). It is expected to reach an annual growth of about 10%, besides its high potential for nutritious GF products (ARSLAN et al., 2019). Market growth is attributed to the following factors: i) increased diagnosis of gluten -related disorders, and ii) health benefits and adoption of individual dietary lifestyles (MARKETSANDMARKETS, 2019). Despite the growth of", "these products category, it is observed that there is still a potential to be explored due to the lack of specific places that provide quality and safe food for people with this food restriction. Moreover, these products also have shorter shelf -life issues, making it difficult to maintain them available in the conventional distribution chain (QUEIROZ; REGO; JARDIM, 2014).", "2.2 Cakes and cake premixes", "Cakes are known to be present at celebration times or as part of today’s food routine. The so -called “wheat cake” emerged as the daily food of Ancient people and was featured on the royal banquet menu, which was offered on festivities (FLANDRIN; MONTANARI, 2007 ). The modern cake is characterized by a sweet taste, short and tender texture, and pleasant flavors and aromas (CONFORTI, 2014). Due to their wide variety and the broad range of their formulations, it is challenging to define cakes in a precise manner (TIREKI, 2008). Nevertheless, the main attributes of a cake are the structure, texture, moistness, color (brown crust), high volume, and a sweet flavor (CONFORTI, 2006).", "In 2018, Brazilian cake industry earned R$ 876 million (≈US$ 219 million) from the sale of 34 thousand tons of the national product, since there is also a massive market for this imported food as well. In this same year, Brazil ranked 10th in the world in terms of sales volume and consumption of cakes (ABIMAPI, 2019). Cakes represent a specia lty with the highest added value per kilogram in the bakery segments, and it is estimated that this market grows 7.5% per year in Brazil. Between 2002 -2003 and 2008 - 2009, there was an average increase of 49.7% in the consumption of cake premixes by Brazili an consumers, especially those with up to 2 minimum monthly wages, with 278.1% on the expansion of this market (QUEIROZ; REGO; JARDIM, 2014). Ingredients play an essential role in creating an acceptable cake (CONFORTI, 2006). Among the main ingredients, we can mention flour, sugar, fat, eggs, milk, salt, water, chemical leavening agents, cocoa powder, commercial starch, aromas, and emulsifiers. Each ingredient contributes to a particular aspect of cake quality: i) structure; ii) tenderness; iii) moisture; i v) flavor; and v) preservative (CONFORTI, The cake batter is an emulsion of the oil -in-water type with air bubbles entrapped in the fat phase, and the remainder of the ingredients dissolved or dispersed in the water phase (BENNION; B AMFORD, 1997). The processes during cake making are not fully", "understood. During baking, the cake structure sets as a result of starch gelatinization and egg protein coagulation. Sugar controls oven rise, structure fixation, and collapse, while fat enhance s aeration for leavening and improves tenderness and mouthfeel (WILDERJANS et al ., 2013). Egg proteins contribute to stabilizing the gas cells migrating from the fat to the aqueous phase during the first stage of baking (HESSO et al., 2015). The essential ingredients for a risen product are the leavening agents. They are characterized as air, steam, and carbonic gas (CO 2). In a cake batter, chemical sources of CO 2 are baking powder and baking soda (sodium bicarbonate) (CONFORTI, The cake flour specification used will be strongly influenced by the recipe and type of cake being manufactured. Protein content tends to be relatively unimportant because cake structures are mainly based on the properties of the starch in the flour (CAUVAIN, 2009). The substitution of wheat flour with other starchy flour is favored in the formulation of cake premixes since soft wheat flour is used when compared to those used in bread making (RESENDE, 2007; RAMOS; PIEMOLINI -BARRETO; SANDRI, 2012). Soft wheat flours have lower amounts of protein (≈ 7−9%), higher starch content, and rheological characteristics of greater extensibility and less elasticity. The cake recipe is a balanced formula, and, therefore, measurements must be precise (CONFORTI, 2014). Based primarily on their recipe and/or production methods, cakes can be divided into several categories (Figure 2).", "Figure 2 - Major ingredients and classification of cake types based on the combination of formulations and production methods", "Source: Adapted from WILDERJANS et al., 2013 .", "The trend toward conscious indulgence, which is marked by the redesign of traditional products to meet consumers’ expectations of linking food enjoyment with nutrition, health, naturalness, and sustainability, has strongly in fluenced changes in most bakery products, including cakes (QUEIROZ; REGO; JARDIM, 2014). These products, for example, are presented in controlled (or individual) portions, which satisfy the demand for a piece of indulgence, not significantly affecting cons umers’ weight control and healthy eating habits (CAKES, 2012 apud QUEIROZ; REGO; JARDIM, According to “Brazil Food Trends 2020”, the cake is in the category of products that will be most consumed due to the impacts generated by the convenience trend (ITAL, 2010). Products that are easy to prepare and do not require much skill or knowledge of culinary techniques attract the attention of many consumers. Cake premixes are in this niche, and their main advantage is the guarantee of product standardizatio n. Cake premixes appeared in 1943, and after the World War II has begun its large -scale sale, due to the following attractive features: longer shelf life, low prices, and time -saving in preparation (BORGES, 2007). It is merely necessary to add eggs and milk (and sometimes fat) to the commercially available cake premixes to prepare homemade cakes (RESENDE, 2007). Or, if the mixture is a complete one, the addition", "of only water is needed to obtain the cake batter (BORGES, 2007). The production of cakes from t heir premixes is shown in Figure 3.", "Figure 3 - Flow diagram of cake production from cake premixes", "Source: A self elaboration.", "Another fundamental requirement for a good cake is the complete dispersion of the ingredients. Hence, the purpose of batter mixing is: i) to disperse all the ingredients as efficiently as possible, and ii) to incorporate air into the mix (CONFORTI, 2006) . The optimum cake-baking conditions are determined by several factors such as level of sweetener in the formulation, milk amount in the batter, batter fluidity, pan size, the shape and size of the cakes, and so forth. Incorrect baking can offset the effect of all the other factors like correct formulations, excellent raw materials, and proper processing methods. Due to these circumstances, baking is probably the most critical factor governing the quality of a cake (TIREKI, 2008). When the cake is removed from the oven, it cools and the gases contract or condense (WILDERJANS et al., 2013) . There is no legislation, either Brazilian or international, that states a definition or mandatory ingredients for cake premixes. The only definition contained in the “Techni cal Regulation for Food Preparation and Ready -to-Eat Food Mixtures” deals with food preparation mixtures: “These are the products obtained by mixing ingredients, intended for the preparation of food by the consumer with the addition of other ingredient(s). May require heating or cooking. The resulting product after preparation, according to the manufacturer’s instructions, must be the one mentioned in the designation of Mixture” (BRASIL, 2005).", "2.3 Thermoplastic extrusion", "Extrusion is a process that combine s several unit operations, including mixing, cooking, kneading, shearing, shaping, and forming (FELLOWS, 2017). Today, their processing functions may include conveying, mixing, shearing, separation, heating or cooling, shaping, co -extrusion, venting volati les and moisture, flavor generation,", "encapsulation, and sterilization (GUY, 2001a). It is a method in which starch and/or protein are transformed into plastic polymers by adding little water, and they are cooked with a high degree of mechanical energy. Foo d extruders can perform one or several functions at the same time while processing food or feed: starch cooking (gelatinization); enzyme in -activation; thermal cooking; agglomerating ingredients; protein denaturation and texturization; degassing ingredient s; pasteurization and sterilization of food spoilage and pathogenic microorganisms; homogenizing; unitizing; expansion, puffing; texture alteration; and dehydration (RIAZ, 2000 apud RIAZ, 2001; SHARMA; MULVANEY; RIZVI, 2003).", "Thermoplastic extrusion is a p rocess that modifies the physical and chemical properties of raw materials, which, in turn, determine the quality attributes of the food product. This technique is one of the most versatile operations used by the food industry to cook or process food, gene rating ready or semi -ready products for consumption (SHARMA; MULVANEY; RIZVI, 2003). Extrusion is a widespread process in the production of snacks, breakfast cereals, confectionery, and protein -based foods (SHARMA; MULVANEY; RIZVI, 2003; FELLOWS, 2017). It can be seen as an example of a size enlargement process, in which granular or powdered foods are re - formed into larger pieces (FELLOWS, 2017).", "A wide range of thermomechanical treatments is feasible due to the control of critical process variables, such as speed and profile of the screw, temperature, moisture, feed speed, and size, and shape of die (SHARMA; MULVANEY; RIZVI, 2003). The extrusion process operates in a steady state of dynamic equilibrium due to its continuous nature, where the input variable s are equivalent to the output. Therefore, to obtain the required characteristics for an extruded product, the inputs must be adjusted to provide the right physical conditions for the occurrence of chemical changes within the extruder", "Figure 4 - Interaction of raw material properties, process variables, and product characteristics", "Source: Adapted from CHESSARI; SELLAHEWA, 2001.", "Extrusion has become a notorious type of processing due to some particularities (GUY, 2001a; FELLOWS, 2017): i) it is highly versatile as it is possible to offer the consumer a considerable variety of products that cannot be easily manufactured by other methods, only by changing ingredients; ii) it has lower processing costs and higher productivit y when compared to other cooking and/or forming processes; iii) because they operate continuously, the extruders have high automated production rates (between 300–9,000 kg / h, depending on the product); iv) if the heat treatment HTST occurs, there is the maintenance of many heat -sensitive nutritional components, besides the reduction of the microbial load, which impacts the product quality directly; and v) as there is no process effluent, there are not, therefore, no water treatment costs and no environmen tal pollution problems.", "Many extruded foods of nutritional importance are produced nowadays, although snacks were the first products in this category to achieve great commercial success (CAMIRE, 2001). The most commonly used raw materials are wheat and cor n. However, other starchy bases may be employed, such as potato, rice, barley, rye, oat, sorghum, tapioca, cassava, buckwheat, pea flour, etc. (GUY, 2001b). Extrusion can help to improve nutrition in less -developed countries, as single - screw extruders are relatively inexpensive and easy to maintain. Processes involving extrusion should be developed for the recovery of food industry residues, such as whey", "protein and fruits by -products, and other vegetable crops (beans, millet, and cassava), thus producing h ighly shelf -stable foods and free from microbial contaminants Functional ingredients that have an unpleasant taste alone can be mixed with other components into a novel food item through extrusion, thereby developing the functional foods ma rket. In this regard, extruded functional foods: i) for weight loss diets should have fewer calories by increasing dietary fiber and resistant starch in their formulation, ii) to promote better heart health should increase the amount of soluble fiber, and iii) focused on protecting the immune system may invest in the use of milk proteins. Also, extrusion can reduce antinutritive compounds, promoting safer and more nutritious foods (CAMIRE, 2001).", "The extrusion process involves high temperature, pressure, an d shear. Every above -cited characteristic causes axiomatic changes in all physicochemical and functional properties of raw materials, including the content of phenolic compounds and their antioxidant activity (SARAWONG et al., 2014).", "There are two types of extruders used in food and feed industries: single -screw and twin -screw extruders. Pasta, fish, and pet foods are preferably produced in the single -screw extruder, where the only force that keeps material rotating and advancing with the screw is friction against the inner surface of the cylinder (or extruder barrel) (Figure 5). In contrast, raw materials that require uniform processing, low cutting speeds, and high pressures, such as those with low viscosity, suspensions or sugars, high temperature -sensiti ve, and fast solubilizing gums, are processed in the twin -screw extruders (SHARMA; MULVANEY; RIZVI, 2003).", "Figure 5 - Single -screw extruder barrel components", "Source: Adapted from RIAZ, 2001.", "There is a similarity on the principles of operatio n in both types of extruders: raw materials are fed into the extruder barrel and, then, the screw(s) convey the food along with it. Further down the barrel, smaller flights restrict the volume and increase the resistance to movement of the food. As a resul t, it fills the barrel and the spaces between the screw flights and becomes compressed. As it moves further along the barrel, the screw kneads the material into a semi -solid, plasticized mass (FELLOWS, 2017). Several operations (heating, cooling, conveying , feeding, compression, reaction, mixing, homogenizing, melting, cooking, texturing, and forming) take place in different processing zones of an extruder (SHARMA; MULVANEY; RIZVI, 2003). The main components of this equipment are (Figure 6): i) feeding zone : where low -density raw materials are introduced into the extruder barrel; ii) kneading zone: where the compression proceeds and raw material loses its granular characteristic, and its density begins to increase, while the pressure inside the barrel also r ises; iii) final cooking zone: a region where a rapid rise in temperature and pressure occurs, affecting density, color, and functional properties of the final product; and iv) die: an area where the final product is established.", "Figure 6 - Representative process of direct expansion of an extruder", "Source: Adapted from SHARMA; MULVANEY; RIZVI, 2003.", "The water added to starchy foods during extrusion cooking causes the starch granules to swell, which absorb water and become hydrated. Starch gelatinization takes part when higher moisture contents and higher temperatures occur. Its consequence is the production of a viscous plasticized mass, which, when leaving the die, is in a glassy state. Then the product expands rapidly, and the temperature falls below the glass transition state, forming a structure of strands and matrices that determine the texture of the product. The agents that most influence the texture and color of the extruded product are the chemical composition, especially the amount and type of starches, proteins, fats, and sugars, and the moisture content of the raw material, which results in different viscosities and several flow characteristics (FELLOWS, 2017) (Figure 7).", "Figure 7 - Changes in raw materials in an extrusion cookin g process", "Source: Adapted from GUY, 2001b .", "The use of high temperatures reduces the processing time and allows a full transformation of raw material to its functional form in periods as little as 30 –120 s", "(GUY, 2001b). If the raw material is heated above 100 °C, the process is called thermoplastic extrusion cooking and is categorized as HTST (High -Temperature Short Time). Concomitantly with its emerging from the die, the food rapidly expands and cools as moisture is flashed off as steam. Usually, the formed product has low water activity (between 0.1 and 0.4) (FELLOWS, 2017).", "Although processing units have become very sophisticated since the 1990s (GUY, 2001a), the extrusion process has been conceptualized as one of the most popular procedures designe d by the food industries for the production of ready and semi -ready foods, with enhanced technological and sensory profiles (WANG et al., 2007) (Figure", "Source: Adapted from CHESSARI; SELLAHEWA, 2001.", "Two main product requirements extruded products must meet, and most of them are affected by the composition of the raw materials, extruder operating conditions, and post extruder operations.

Other routes of introd uction may have been the regions of Italian colonization, in the valleys of the Uruguay and Pelotas Rivers, whose people cultivated the “seed cane”, a type of sweet sorghum, which is used in the manufacture of molasses and cachaça in this region. From 1920 until the late 1960s, sorghum culture was reintroduced in Brazil in an orderly way, through public Research Institutes and Universities.

The relatively higher hydrophobicity of sorghum kafirins compared to maize zeins may influence their relative d igestibilities. It appears that there is a higher number of protein crosslinkings during wet cooking of sorghum than corn, for example, which may explain the lower protein digestibility of cooked sorghum (DUODU et al ., 2003). Extrusion is an industrial pro cess used in sorghum processing to improve the nutritional efficiency of this cereal because that process increases sorghum exposure to enzymatic action during digestion (DUODU et al., 2003; RIBAS, 2014).", "Many sorghum varieties contain higher levels of pol yphenolic compounds than other commonly consumed foods, including other cereals such as wheat, rice, barley, and millet. These polyphenols, which contain antioxidant properties that help to maintain good health, may also contribute to the slow digestion of sorghum starch by inhibiting digestive enzymes (AWIKA; ROONEY, 2004). The type and levels of phenolic compounds present are related to pericarp color and the presence of pigment testa on the sorghum grain (KHAN et al., 2013).", "Regarding sorghum starch, the amylose and amylopectin concentrations are 27% and 73%, respectively, in the white sorghum genotype, and 25% and 75%, in the red cultivar (BOUDRIES et al., 2009), resulting in amylopectin/amylose ratio around 3:1. The gelatinization temperature of native sorghum starch is in the range of 68 –75 °C, with an initial temperature higher than the common cereals and tubers (BOBBIO; BOBBIO, 2003). Sorghum starch granules (Figure 11) are tightly packed, surrounded by protein bodies and embedded in a protein matrix (DUODU et al., 2003), which can reduce starch gelatinization during cooking. Due to the conjunction of three factors present in sorghum, which are i) the differing nature of the protein matrix and its interaction with starch, ii) a greater abundance of dis ulfide -bonded proteins, and iii) presence of nonwaxy starch and the accompanying granule -bound starch synthase, starch digestibility appears to be lower than other cereal starches (WONG et al., 2009).", "Figure 11 - Sorghum protein bodies, starch, and the glutelin matrix", "Source: Adapted from MESA -STONESTREET; ALAVI; BEAN, 2010.", "Low starch digestibility is undesirable for efficient livestock feed and human consumption under energy -deficient conditions.

Dietary fibers are grouped into two main categories. The first category includes water -soluble polymers, which include pectins, gums, and β -glucans. The second category consists of water -insoluble components such as cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin, and resistant starch. All physiological effects attributed to dietary fiber are related to the components of both categories (JIMÉNEZ -ESCRIG; SANCHÉZ -MUNIZ, 2000; FERNÁNDEZ -LOPEZ et al., 2009).", "In general, dietary fiber concentrates from fruits have better nutritional quality compared to those isolated from cereals, due to a series of characteristics: higher proportion between soluble and insoluble fibers; higher fiber content in general; lower metabolic energy value; water and lipid holding capacities; absence of phytic acid; and expressive content of associated anti oxidant bioactive compounds (flavonoids, carotenoids, vitamin C, etc.) (JIMÉNEZ -ESCRIG et al., 2001; CHAU; HUANG, 2003; LARIO et al., 2004; ARVANITOYANNIS; VARZAKAS, 2008). Orange fiber products are already being marketed as supplements, claiming to decrea se fat absorption during digestion (VAN BOEKEL, 2012). Since a large amount of fresh fruit would be needed to achieve the effect of the dried peel, it can be valuable the offering of a capsule or food with dried orange pomace (BARBIERE, 2004).", "According to the 2008 -2009 Household Budget Survey, 74% of Brazilian people aged ten and over have inadequate dietary fiber intake (RIO DE JANEIRO, 2011).", "2.4.2.2 Production data", "According to the latest Systematic Survey of Brazilian Agricultural Production (LSPA, Levantamento Sistemático da Produção Agrícola ), made by Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatística (IBGE), Brazil produced 16,677,091 t of orange in 2018, being the Southeast region the responsible for about 82% of national orange production Brazil is the world’s largest producer of oranges, with approximately 24% of production, followed by China, India, Mexico, and the United States of America. These five countries are responsible for 59% of all orange produced in the world in 2017 (FAOSTA T, 2019), although they use their productions in different ways. For example, while Brazil and the United States of America use more than 70% of the oranges they harvest for juice production, Mexico and China sell their fruits mainly for fresh consumption (CITRUS BR, 2019).", "Brazil is responsible for the vast majority of orange juice consumed worldwide, as it holds 85% of the world’s export of this product. Only in the Citrus Belt region (located between São Paulo and “ Triângulo Mineiro ”) is produced 53% of all orange juice in the world (CITRUS BR, 2013).", "2.4.2.3 Orange pomace", "Although cereals are characterized as the preponderant raw materials in the supply of dietary fiber to the food industry, there is a tendency to find new sources of dietary fiber (CHAU; HUANG, 2003). As interest in fiber -rich foods has increased and given the importance of these food constituents, fiber -rich products and ingredients are expanding rapidly in western markets (VERGARA -VALENCIA et al., 2007). Since approximately 50% of the m ass of citrus fruits comprise the tailings when they are squeezed in the juice production, the economic yield in the citrus juice industry can be increased by obtaining co -products from these residues. Some barriers make these wastes having a limited use, among them a large amount of water they contain, which raises problems of collection, transport, and storage (ALEXANDRINO et al ., 2007). Substantial use of orange processing residues is in addition to animal feed, with good acceptance by cattle and goats ( ITAVO et al., 2000; LOUSADA JR et al., 2005). From the residue remaining after the extraction of juice, called citrus pulp (consisting of a mixture of rind, inner portions, seeds and unselected fruits, which represents between 50 and 65% of the total by ma ss, depending on the variety of fruit,", "processing methods used and the influence of environmental factors), other products can be obtained, such as: i) dehydrated citrus pulp; ii) citrus molasses (made by concentrating the pressed liquor from the residue o f citrus peels); iii) citrus peel liquor (similar to citrus molasses, but not concentrated); iv) citrus activated sludge (produced from liquids of the citrus processing plants); v) beverage clouding agent (made by enzymatic peel treatment); vi) bioabsorben ts for heavy metal removal; vii) natural antioxidant obtained from the peel extract, utilized to suppress the development of rancidity in oils and fats, which can replace the use of butylhydroxyanisol (BHA) and butylhydroxytoluene (BHT); viii) essencial oi ls; ix) insecticides (made from volatile fractions of peel); x) pectin; xi) flavonoids (mainly hesperidin); and xii) carotenoids (ARVANITOYANNIS; VARZAKAS, 2008).", "Although abundant studies point to diversified uses for orange waste, orange juice industry by -products remain largely unused (ALEXANDRINO et al ., 2007). Nevertheless, as the functional food market is becoming increasingly prestigious and rapidly developin g, antioxidant compounds and dietary fibers from citrus fruit processing are promising players in this market. These components help to overcome the deficit of dietary fiber in the contemporary human diet and the prevention of several diseases (FERNANDEZ -LOPES et al., 2004).", "2.4.3 Whey powder", "Bovine whey is mainly obtained from the acid and/or enzymatic coagulation of most of the whole or skimmed milk protein in cheese making (Figure 13) (IEA, 2013). Whey is a by -product of the dairy industry that has a hig h environmental pollution factor if discarded without previous treatment in soil and rivers (PILER; TAKEITI,", "Figure 13 - General process of cheese manufacture and whey obtention", "Source: Adapted from ORDÓÑEZ, 2005c; BALDASSO, 2008.", "About 8 kg of whey is produced in every 1 kg of cheese made. This by -product can be used in the manufacture of a range of foods, such as energy drinks, cookies, bread, bar -shaped foods (cereal, chocolate, protein bars, etc.), ice cream, and fruit drinks (SANTIAG O, 2013). In Brazil, some industries use whey for concentration and drying, producing whey powder, or also use in the fluid form, in various dairy drinks (IEA, Whey contains approximately 20% of soluble proteins, almost all lactose, and about 50% of all nutrients generally found in milk. It is a by -product of industrial production of casein and butter as well. It is a liquid that contains a mixture of proteins with various functional properties (such as emulsification, aeration, gel formation) and numerous uses, requiring processing for each specific purpose. Countries with developed dairy industry add value to the production line by processing this by -product, as they recognize it as a high nutritional value functional ingredient (IEA, 2013). Advance s in various solid -liquid separation technologies enable the dairy industry to produce a large number of whey products, with excellent functional, nutritional, and taste properties (ABD EL -SALAM; EL -SHIBINY; SALEM, 2009). Ingredients made from whey are not only used for their functional properties but also because of their high nutritional value and GRAS (Generally Recognized as Safe) status (KRISSANSEN, 2007).", "Over the past two decades, the evolution of separation technologies (porous and/or selective memb ranes) has allowed numerous whey components to become", "widely used additives in food manufacturing. Whey can undergo several treatments, giving rise to products with specific qualitative and quantitative profiles of proteins, minerals, lipids, and sugars. U ltrafiltration is used to concentrate proteins. Diafiltration is used to remove lactose, minerals, and other low molecular weight components, thus producing whey protein concentrates (WPC). Depending on its concentration, there are WPC containing 35%, 50%, 65% and 80% protein. When the 90% protein threshold is reached, the product is called Whey Protein Isolate (WPI) (MADUREIRA et al., 2007). Besides, protein hydrolysates made from whey are also commercialized (ABD EL - SALAM; EL -SHIBINY; SALEM, 2009).", "Powder ed milk is gradually being replaced by whey powder in bread, cookie, and ice cream formulations, as it is also a nutritious ingredient, performs well in the industrial process, and is cheaper. The industry has been diversifying products with whey, as the c hallenge is to let the consumer know the benefits and properties of this ingredient. Sports nutrition and milk protein consumption are becoming popular all over the world (SANTIAGO, 2013).", "2.4.3.1 Composition and nutritional aspects", "Milk has two large protein families in its composition. The first encompasses caseins, which are insoluble, account for 80% of all milk protein, and can be recovered by isoelectric precipitation (by in situ acid addition or production) or by rennet additio n.

During the extrusion process, the temperature in the last section reaches very high levels (between 100 –180 °C). However, as the retention time in this section is short, only partial denaturation of whey proteins occurs, ensuring the maintenance of their nutritional and functional properties (BRNČIĆ et al., 2011).", "2.4.3.2 Production data", "Brazilian data on whey availability is highly inaccurate since a significant portion of the cheese is produced by small companies, which have no structure to process whey. Hence, the destination of this by -product is for animal feed and discarding surplus in rivers. This tailing is one of the significant environmental problems of the dairy chain The São Paulo Dairy Industry Union ( Sindicato das Indústrias de Laticínios de São Paulo - Sindileite ) estimates that Brazil already can produce 115,000 t of whey powder per year. Nevertheless, the production is only 40,000 t due to the technology used in this process, as liquid whey is very perishable. It needs to be k ept refrigerated, and it is expensive to transport. It is estimated that this sector is growing above 10% per year and that Brazil is moving towards self -sufficiency (SANTIAGO, 2013). The demand for Brazilian industries for whey is not adequately supplied with the national production of this product. Brazil’s main trading partners in this market are, in order of importance, Argentina, the United States of America, and France (FAOSTAT, The top five world producers of whey powder in the period of 2004 -2014 were France, the USA, Germany, the Netherlands, and Poland. Europe is the largest producing region, with about 72% of world production (FAOSTAT, 2019).", "2.5 Sensory analysis", "Recently, just about all consumer product companies in the food and beverage industry are aware of sensory evaluation, and most agree that it has a role within their company (STONE; SIDEL, 2004a). Thus, companies must have a deep understanding of how consumers identify products, how their needs are shaped and influenced, and how the y make product choices based on their convenience (ARES et al., 2010c). An important focus of current research on innovative and emerging technologies for food production concerns the acceptance by consumers. In this context, optimizing", "the sensory qualit y of these products is critical to market success. However, in today’s context of highly competitive and fast -moving markets, optimal sensory quality alone does not guarantee success or consumer acceptance (CARDELLO; SCHUTZ; LESHER, 2007; ENNEKING, NEUMANN e HENNEBERG, 2007). Consumer perceptions of safety, cost, risk, and/or benefits associated with new technologies can negatively influence consumer choice and purchasing decisions ( CARDELLO; SCHUTZ; LESHER, 2007 ). Consumers also deal with various sensory a nd non -sensory factors such as product information (brand, price, place of origin), attitudes and beliefs (convenience, health properties), and past experiences to make decisions related to food consumption (JAEGER, 2006).", "Sensory food evaluation is a scie ntific discipline used to evoke, measure, analyze and interpret reactions of ingredients and/or food characteristics that are perceived by the senses of sight, smell, taste, touch, and hearing (STONE; SIDEL, 2004a). Sensory testing makes it possible to stu dy the sensory properties of products using humans as measuring instruments (LATREILLE et al ., 2006). Although the sensory qualities of food are often described in terms of its taste, in practice, this taste experience is a complex interaction among multip le sensory attributes (YEOMANS et al., 2008). From a food production and development perspective, the dynamic and multisensory aspects of food perception have important consequences for a better understanding of the processes used by consumers to assess th e acceptability and sensory properties of food products (BLAKE, 2004).", "Sensory analysis is a tool capable of identifying and quantitatively modeling the main drivers for product acceptance. The use of this instrument allowed companies to increase their mar ket shares, as well as implement cost reduction through better use of technology. All of this has been made possible as a direct result of the use of sensory resources, better understanding of human behavior measurement, combined with a more systematic and professional approach to the testing process (STONE; SIDEL, 2004b). Product evaluation is a multi -step process in which a group of individuals responds to stimuli, i.e., a set of products, by marking a table of indicators according to a specific set of instructions. The marks are then converted to numerical values for statistical evaluation (STONE; SIDEL, 2004b).", "The type of sample presentation that will be evaluated is a critical experimental factor that may affect the perceived variation between simila r products. There are 2 sample presentation protocols used for sensory analysis: simultaneous or monadic. In", "simultaneous presentations, all products are presented to assessors at one time, and only one feature at a time is evaluated in all samples. Also, assessors have the opportunity to compare samples on each attribute carefully. When samples are directly compared, tasters can detect minor differences between samples and make more precise decisions about their relative differences (SAINT -EVE et al., 2006 ). By using monadic sequential presentation, a product is evaluated on all the individual affective sensory attributes for which it is questioned. The sample is then removed before the next product is supplied and evaluated. Thus, differences between sampl es are less likely to be observed because no other example can be used as a direct reference and, therefore, assessors should also rely on their reference structure and expectations for judging the sample (COLYAR et al., 2009). The monadic sequential metho d is considered more realistic by some researchers because it more accurately reflects the process of obtaining a product by consumers, using it at home, and making opinions on the subject without the opportunity to make direct comparisons (SAINT -EVE et al., 2006).", "Measuring how much consumers appreciate a particular food is a logical and necessary strategy before substantial capital investment in equipment, production and distribution, advertising, and all other steps related to the launch of a new food pr oduct (STONE; SIDEL, 2004b). In recent years, many techniques using untrained assessors or consumers to create sensory profiles have been developed and studied to overcome some limitations of descriptive analysis (VALENTIN et al ., 2012; VARELA; ARES, 2012) . Affective sensory methods are hedonic resources which objective is to evaluate the preference and/or acceptance of a product in the consumer market. The test is performed with the target audience of the product, being the untrained assessors. The develo pment and launch of new food products on the market require some measure as to whether the products are appreciated or not (NICOLAS; MARQUILLY; O’MAHONY, 2010). One possible approach to product optimization is to ask consumers to describe the sensory chara cteristics of products and also to identify their ideal product (ARES et al ., 2011). In the preponderant paradigm of sensory science, information about the sensory characteristics of food is collected from panels formed by trained assessors, while consumer s are only asked about their preference, not providing data on how they perceive the sensory attributes of products (ARES; JAEGER, 2013). One of the most recently developed methodologies is Check -All-That-Apply questions (CATA), also known as “pick any” (D UTCOSKY, 2013).", "The CATA technique was first used in marketing research to study consumer perceptions of different brands. It was recently introduced in sensory analysis to understand consumer preference, helping to optimize food products (VALENTIN et al., The CATA method is based on a list of words or phrases displayed to the assessors to choose all the options they consider appropriate to describe a product, indicating which sensory attributes are actually perceived by the consumer in a food (ARES et al ., 2010b). This assessment is different from scaling in the sense that the intensities of the attributes are not measured (DOOLEY; LEE; MEULLENET, 2010). These data consist of dichotomous response (presence = 1; absence = 0) corresponding to each attr ibute, and various multivariate statistical techniques can be applied for the exploration and representation of these data (GIACALONE; BREDIE; FRØST, 2013). This type of methodology has the advantage of gathering information about the identified attributes of the product without the need for scale and, depending on how the terms are created, allows a slightly less artificial description of the main sensory properties of the tested article (DOOLEY; LEE; MEULLENET, 2010).", "Attributes are not limited to sensory aspects, but may also be related to hedonic and emotional aspects (DOOLEY; LEE; MEULLENET, 2010). The questions are part of a specific type of multiple -choice question where assessors are not limited to selecting only one answer option. Instead, they are free to choose any option they consider appropriate, and the relevance of each response option is determined by calculating its frequency of use (ARES; JAEGER, 2013). Another favorable aspect of this methodology is that assessors are not forced to focus th eir attention and evaluate product -specific attributes (SMYTH et al., 2006).", "The CATA is a versatile tool that is increasingly being applied for several different purposes in sensory and consumer science (ARES; JAEGER, 2013). Some studies have already show n that the results obtained by CATA are similar to those obtained by trained assessors panels (ARES et al ., 2010a; DOOLEY; LEE; MEULLENET, 2010; BRUZZONE; ARES; GIMÉNEZ, 2012). The CATA method requires minimal instruction, is relatively easy to perform, an d the questionnaire is quickly completed. Besides, the CATA approach directly includes consumer input into the product development process (VALENTIN et al., 2012).", "The main problems with CATA are how to choose and optimize the list of words, terms, or phra ses proposed to assessors and the definition of the number of attributes to", "address (VALENTIN et al ., 2012). Sensory terms may correspond to the descriptors used by trained panelists to characterize products or could be selected by considering the results of previous focus groups or quantitative consumption studies (VARELA; The order in which terms are included in the CATA test could be a valuable source of bias in consumer profile studies, as memory limitation, cognitive processing, and the wa y assessors complete the questionnaire are factors that influence the result (ARES; JAEGER, 2013).", "Although the use of the CATA methodology is already established as a way to obtain reliable sensory characterizations of products from consumer supplied elem ents, and at a lower cost than would typically be associated with a trained sensory panel, little is known about how decisions regarding data collection and analysis in CATA influence the results obtained (ARES; JAEGER, 2013).", "Sensory product descriptions using the CATA method with consumers are highly reproducible (JAEGER et al., 2013; ARES et al., 2014a) if the randomized presentation of terms in the questionnaire (ARES et al., 2014b) is used. Additionally, the evaluated products are presented to the asse ssors in a monadic sequential manner, with a balanced order of sample presentation (VARELA; ARES, 2012).", "References ABD EL -SALAM, M.H.; EL -SHIBINY, S.; SALEM, A..

According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), “sustainable diets are those diets with low environmental impacts which contribute to food and nutrition security and to healthy life for present and future generations. Sustainable diets are protective and respectful of biodiversity and ecosystems, culturally acceptable, accessible, economical ly fair and affordable; nutritionally adequate, safe and healthy; while optimizing natural and human resources” (FAO, 2010). In this context, consumers demand foods ‘free from’ ingredients which are recognized negatively in various ways (INGREDION, 2014), such as, for example, chemically modified starch. Hence, food producers must adapt to this trend by offering ‘clean label’ foods, which are based on the assumption that consumers favorably perceive ingredients that appear natural and known, and they avoid the processed and synthetic ones (ASCHEMANN -WITZEL; VARELA; PESCHEL, 2019).", "Currently, food processing ‘wastes’ are considered as a cheap source of valuable nutraceuticals. Thus, they must be recovered inside the food chain as functional additives in diffe rent products (GALANAKIS, 2012). Orange pomace is generated in large volumes since approximately 50% of the mass of orange forms the tailing when they are squeezed in juice production, and it represents a great by -product from the nutritional point of view due mainly to its high dietary fiber content. Whey is a by - product of cheese and casein manufacture, and it represents a significant environmental pollutant if discarded in the soil and rivers without previous treatment. Whey protein, which represents 20% of the total milk protein content, is acknowledged as a functional ingredient of high nutritional value (DIAAS1 = 96% of histidine for adults) (FAO, 2013). Also, it has been notified as GRAS (Generally Recognized as Safe) (KRISSANSEN, 2007).

Sorghum ( Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench) is a cereal that can be used as a starchy base to prepare GF ingredients to be used in food products. Sorghum is the fifth most important cereal crop worldwide (Statistics D ivision of FAO [FAOSTAT], 2018), which were destined for human and animal feeds. Sorghum is one of the most drought -tolerant cereal grain crops and out - performs other cereals under environmental stresses, such as high average temperatures and water defici t during the year. Besides, it requires little input during growth, and it is consequently more economi cal to produce. It represents an impor tant crop for future human use, due to the increase in world population and the decrease of water supplies (TAYLO R; SCHOBER; BEAN, 2006; PONTIERI et al. , 2011). Nevertheless, as there is little industrialized food and ingredients made with this GF cereal, such products reach fewer people around the world (RATNAVATHI; PATIL, 2013).

Extrusion cooking has many advantages, such as its lower processing cost, and it is an environmentally -friendly operation, g iven that it is a low -moisture technique. Consequently, it does not produce significant process effluents, reducing levels of environmental pollution, and water treatment costs. Extrusion produces shelf -stable, safer, and more nutritious foods. Functional ingredients, such as sorghum, extra dietary fiber, and whey protein, can be incorporated into new food items, using the ability that extruders have to blend different ingredients in novel foods (GUY, 2001).

The highest SME values (> 300 kJ/kg) occurred under lower CM values (≤ 16%) and higher S (≥ 75%) (Figure 15). In extrusion processes, SME is an excellent quantitative parameter, since the mechanical energy delivered to the extruded bulk determin es the degree of macromolecular transformations and the consequent interactions that occur in that bulk, that is, the rheological properties of the melt ( MORARU; KOKINI, 2003) . Consequently, SME can be used to indicate the energy consumption of the process .

The increase in WSI can be attributed to the increase in the portion of amylose and amylopectin degraded into smaller fragments leaching out through opened starch granules, whose structures mod ified due to thermal treatment (LAI, 2001). WSI also reveals the degradation of dietary fiber components submitted to severe processing conditions, which implies the production of compounds having a low molecular weight ( HUANG; MA, 2016 ). As S decreased, t he amount of orange pomace flour increased, which consequently increased the content of fibers in the formulation. Hence, it was observed that the WSI in the formulations with a higher amount of fibers increased, that is, fiber concentration and degradatio n during the extrusion process increased.", "The higher CM values during extrusion result in a lower degree of starch gelatinization due to the lower shear rates that occurred during the process, therefore resulting in lower WSI values (HAGENIMANA; DING; FANG , 2006). Similarly, an increase in WSI was verified in the assays that presented the lowest CM values. In general, the increase in T leads to the increase in WSI, owing to the increase in damaged starch granules, which result in more water -soluble compoun ds (HAGENIMANA; DING; FANG , 2006; RASHID et al., 2015). This circumstance was not confirmed by the WSI results of the mixtures studied since WSI increased as T decreased. Starch granules in sorghum are surrounded by protein bodies (MESA - STONESTREET; ALAVI; BEAN, 2010). Hence, it is possible that gelatinization prevailed over granular disorganization, for the proteins and fibers may have caused a damping effect on shear rate, preventing the starch from degrading.", "WAI estimates the amount of water absorbed by the starch. It can be used as a measuring parameter for the gelatinization degree of the sample ( ANDERSON et al., 1969), given that the native starch does not absorb water. In contrast, the extruded starch absorbs water quickly and form a gel (RASHID et al., 2015), at room temperature or lower. As a consequence, the damaged starch presents a higher capacity for holding water at room temperature and swelling when compared to the native starch, increasing WAI (SARAWONG et al., 2014).

The PV corresponds to the maximum viscosity presented by the sample during the heating cycle of the pasting viscosity profile. This property indic ates the water -binding capacity of the sample, and also the maximum swelling of the starch granules, which correlates to the quality of the final product (RAGAEE; ADBEL -AAL, 2006). The higher PV values (> 220 cP) occurred at the CM conditions between 16% a nd 18% (Figure 15). The higher the CM values during the processing of raw material, the lower the integrity loss and the crystallinity of the starch granule (LAI, 2001), given the lower shear rate in the extrusion process, increasing the swelling power and the size of the granules; therefore, allowing higher PV. In our study, the PV values of the pregelatinized composite flours ranged from 127 to 257 cP, which were below the PV values reported by Winger et al. (2014) for flours of 4 varieties of sorghum (45 60 to 5148 cP), which demonstrates the damaging or pregelatinization of the starch during the extrusion process.", "The TR was influenced only by CM, as it may be verified in the mathematical model obtained (Table 7). The higher values of TR (> 180 cP) occurr ed in the CM conditions higher than 16% (Figure 15). The TR corresponds to the minimum viscosity presented by the sample during the cooling cycle of the pasting viscosity profile. The TR may represent the extent of converted starches forms, which are incap able of maintaining, during the cooling process, the integrity of its structure and the entanglements with vicinal starch molecules dispersed in the material, reducing, therefore, pasting viscosity (CARVALHO et al., 2010). Consequently, the TR is usually accompanied by the BKD. After maximum viscosity is reached, the starch granules that are still intact in the sample disrupt, causing the amylose molecules leaching and aligning ( WU et al. , 2016). The higher the CM, the lower will be the degree of starch gelatinization in the extrusion process, due to the lower shear rate caused (HAGENIMANA; DING; FANG , 2006) and, therefore, the higher the amount of starch still native in the sample, at the beginning of the RVA analysis.

The FV highlights the capacity of the sample to form a viscous paste or gel after the cooking and cooling cycle (WU et al. , 2016). During the cooling process, a gel structure will be formed due to the reassociation between the starch molecules, mainly amylose, which causes the FV to increase (RAGAEE; ADBEL -AAL, 2006). Thus, the higher the CM, the higher the introduction of hydrophilic groups in the starch chain, therefore increasing the FV.", "The SB was influenced by the CM, which may be observed in the mathematical model obtained (Table 7). The higher SB values (> 230 cP) occurred in the CM conditions higher than 16%, similarly to what happene d to the TR and FV (Figure 15). The SB frequently correlates to the texture properties of the final product, given that it expresses the degree of starch retrogradation, as a result of the change in the viscosity during its reassociation at the stage of RV A cooling ( WU et al. , 2016).

However, the formulation and the manufacture of baked goods without gluten results in considerable technological problems for both cereal technologists and bakers (GALLAGHER et al ., 2004; MATOS; SANZ; ROSELL, 2014). The development o f food products from other cereals to replace those containing gluten might lead to i) attractive aerated products for the section of the population who consumes GF products and ii) increase utilization of these cereals for human food. Sorghum is particula rly appealing because it can be grown in areas not suitable for wheat (MACRITCHIE, 2010).", "Sorghum ( Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench), a tropical cereal belonging to the tribe of Andropogoneae , is the fifth most important cereal crop worldwide, with more than 57 million tons produced from approximately 41 million ha of land in 2017 (FAOSTAT, 2019). It is yet considered of low value to humans and often used as animal feed (STEFOSKA -NEEDHAM et al. , 2015). For millions of people in parts of Africa and Asia, sorghum is a vital food crop, while it is an underutilized resource in most developed countries (TAYLOR et al., 2006). Still, it has peaked commercial interests in developed economies on how to make sorghum -based food products due to a growing consumer movement de dicated to “healthy living” (STEFOSKA -NEEDHAM et al. , 2015). Nevertheless, unlike wheat proteins, sorghum proteins are not highly functional (MESA -STONESTREET et al., 2010) because they are encapsulated in protein bodies, and this fact probably turns into unavailable its participation in a viscoelastic dough fibril formation (DUODU et al., 2003). Therefore, a modification of sorghum proteins could be one way to get around the technological properties challenge. In this context, it is mandatory to employ an economical, food -compatible, safe, and scaled up to commercial level method to modify the functional properties of sorghum proteins, to enlarge their applications in food formulations (MESA -STONESTREET et al., 2010). As GF has become an expectation for con sumers seeking clean label products (SCHIERHORN, 2018), thermoplastic extrusion can be a process used to satisfy this", "public. The reason is due to its absence of effluents (GUY, 2001) and to improve the protein functionality of sorghum (MESA -STONESTREET et al., 2010) because it is a non-wet cooking process. It is a method in which starch and/or protein and/or dietary fiber are transformed into plastic polymers by adding little water, and they are cooked with a high degree of mechanical energy. The precookin g of sorghum flour promoted by thermoplastic extrusion, to produce pregelatinized starch, seems to be effective in reducing the rate of gas loss from the batters, which has a vital role in the final cake quality (TAYLOR et al ., 2006). Limited research has been performed on the heat treatment of whole -grain sorghum flour.", "Specifically for cakes, reach both oven spring and specific volume similar to a cake with gluten in GF cakes is generally a technological challenge itself, as well as achieving a similar te xture. Particle size profile and dietary fiber, protein, and starch contents and types, which impact on hydration and pasting properties, could have a significant role in technological characteristics of cakes (GÓMEZ et al ., 2008; WILDERJANS et al., 2008; OH et al., 2014; DHEN et al., 2016).", "There are many studies, summarized by Di Cairano et al . (2018), showing the importance of the combination of GF flours on the enhancement of dough and biscuits properties, such as technological, nutritional and sensorial characteristics. This relevance can be easily extrapolated to cakes since gluten plays a minor role in both biscuits and cakes. As designing an experiment typically involves selecting among several candidate designs, a popular choice is a mixture design, which is largely used whenever a multi -component system is concerned. In this type of expe rimental design methodology, the sum of the proportions of the mixture components is always 1, and the other elements that are not part of the design must not change. The application of a mixture design can allow finding the optimal composition to achieve a desirable response (LARROSA, 2013), using mixture contour plots methodology. Rice offers numerous benefits to be a cereal to take part in a mixture design, considering its bland natural taste, colorless and hypoallergenic properties (ARSLAN et al., 2019) . Because of its ready -to-eat nature, availability in many types, and affordable cost, cakes are the most popular bakery items consumed nearly by all levels of society (JEDDOU et al ., 2017). This fact could explain the reason why there are countless resea rches focused on the technological quality of GF cakes. On the other hand, studies based on cake premixes are scarce, despite their comparatively good shelf -life. Since consumers do not usually have easy access to GF flours (especially if it is made of an", "ancient whole -grain) suitable for bakery and confectionery products, it becomes crucial to offer a carefully industrial prepared cake premix. Therefore, costumers find the convenience of rapidly prepare a GF cake at home.", "As the naturally GF flours, such as sorghum, millet, or buckwheat, are not mainstream items in GF foods, because commercial starches are preferably used in these products (LEE at al., 2019), researches into the development of products using GF whole -grains becomes especially important. GF products consumers are progressively demanding GF foods comparable to the long -established gluten ones (MATOS; SANZ; ROSELL, 2014). This fact is stimulating much product innovation because GF products do not match with products containing gluten in term o f technological attributes (ARSLAN et al ., 2019). Hence, the present study was focused on optimizing a cake premix formulation, based on GF cereals (sorghum – in natura and pregelatinized – and rice) and using orange pomace flour as a fiber -rich coproduct, investigating the technological characteristics of GF batter high ratio type cakes, assessed by the mixture contour plots.", "4.2 Material and Methods", "4.2.1 Ingredients", "The ingredients used in the preparation of the cake premixes and the cakes were: pregelat inized composite flour (E) (prepared as described in Section 4.2.1.2), red sorghum whole -grain (Empório Figueira, São Paulo, Brazil), whey powder (Laticínios Porto Alegre, Ponte Nova, Brazil), vegetal shortening (FRS Alimentos, Barueri, Brazil), alkalized and natural cocoa powders (Pryme Foods, Sorocaba, Brazil), emulsifier (polyglycerol fatty acid esters, mono - and diglycerides of fatty acid and polysorbate 80; Corbion, Araucária, Brazil), sodium acid pyrophosphate and monocalcium phosphate (Diadema Agro I ndustrial Ltda, Itapecerica da Serra, Brazil) and chocolate and orange aromas (Frutarom do Brasil Indústria e Comércio Ltda, Porto Feliz, Brazil).

It is crucial to get proper air incorporation in the batter during mixing because the air bubbles serve as nuclei for other leavening agents (STAUFFER, 1990). Regrettably, the SG gives little information about bubble size or dispersion (ZHOU; FAUBION; WALKER, 2011).", "The SG has a direct influence over the final cake volume (KIM; WALKER, 1992). Low SG is desired in cake batter because it indicates that more air was incorporated into the batter (TURABI; SUMNU; SAHIN, 2008), and, therefore, it has been related to a higher cake volume (GÓMEZ et al. , 2007). Similarly, the increase in the number of air bubbles in the batter system seems to translate into a tender baked product (MARSTON; KHOURYIEH; AR AMOUNI, 2016), as the change in the density of the batter affects its crumb attributes (YILDIZ; DOGAN, 2014). For the SG values, it was verified, through the mathematical model (Table 10), that the increase in S, R, and E caused increments in this batter parameter. In contrast, the interaction between R and E displayed a decrease in SG. It is noticed that the SG was affected more strongly by E variation (Figure 18a). This fact is justified because E is a pregelatinized flour (Figure 18) and contributed as a viscosity increasing agent (thickener -like) at the time of mixing, while S and R contributed to increasing viscosity during baking. Since S is the flour that presented the highest amount of lipids in its composition (Table 11), it is plausible that S had shown the highest air -holding capacity", "during mixing, represented by the lowest coefficient value in the mathematical model (Table 10). Lipids contribute to the interface stabilization that favors gas entrapment in the batter matrix (GULARTE; GÓMEZ; ROSEL L, 2012).", "Table 10 - Fitted regression models for the batter specific gravity and the technological parameters of the cakes Parameters Fitted regression model Batter specific Oven spring (OS) Specific volume (SV) Volume index (VI) Symmetry index (SI) Uniformity index (UI) Firmness Springiness S = red sorghum whole -grain flour; R = polished rice flour; E = pregelatinized composite flour; r2 = coefficient of determination.", "Source: A self elaboration.", "Figure 18 - Mixture contour plot for (a) specific gravity (SG), (b) oven spring (OS), (c) specific volume (SV), (d) volume index (VI), (e) symmetry index (SI), (f) uniformity index (UI), (g) firmness, and (h) springiness", "S = red sorghum whole -grain flour; R = polish ed rice flour; E = pregelatinized composite flour.

During baking, starch gelatinization, protein denaturation (especially egg protein coagulation) and air bubbles expansion occur, and cake structure sets as a result of the harmonization of these processes (YANG; FOEGEDING, 2010; HESSO et al., 2015). In the case of chemically leavened cakes, leavening is understood as being due to carbon di oxide (CO 2) produced by chemical reactions, but the expansion of air incorporated into a batter during high -temperature baking also leads the cake to enlarge and form an open interior texture to some extent. Nevertheless, if CO 2 is released too early or to o late, the final product has a small height and volume (STAUFFER, 1990). A more viscous batter with lower SG prevents large air, CO 2 or steam bubbles from coalescing and leaving the batter from the surface (MARSTON; KHOURYIEH; ARAMOUNI, 2016). The baking step underlines the physical and chemical changes in the product components prompting a stabilized crumb structure. During the cooling process, the joined effect of starch gelation and protein coagulation is responsible for the framework setting of the end product (HESSO et al., 2015).", "The amount of time available for batter expansion before the structure sets is a critical factor for the magnitude of the OS (STAUFFER, 1990) . Therefore, as crumb is partially created during baking (CONFORTI, 2014), two impor tant parameters related to the OS are the range of gelatinization temperature and the pasting properties of the flours (Table 11 and Figure 19). The starch gelatinization at low temperatures would prevent the correct expansion of batters (GÓMEZ et al ., 200 8). As higher is the gelatinization temperature, the longer is the development of the crumb (CAUVAIN; YOUNG, 2000), which is dependent on the number and size of air, CO 2, or steam bubbles (CONFORTI, 2014). Hence, it is crucial to have a batter with a suita ble viscosity to retain both the air incorporated during mixing and the expanding air nuclei produced by the baking powder during baking, likewise to ensure the uniform dispersion of the ingredients for optimum performance (WILDERJANS et al., 2008). In the mathematical model of the OS (Table 10), it is showed that increments in S, R, and E increased OS values. Nevertheless, it is observed that R variation affected more intensely the OS than S and E variations (Figure 18b). Meantime, thermal analysis data", "show that the onset and the peak temperatures of R gelatinization were lower than the S and E ones (Table 11). However, the values of PT, PV, TR, and BKD of R are higher than the S and E ones (Table 11 and Figure 18), suggesting that, in this study, the viscosity provided by the flours is more important for crumb development than their gelatinization temperatures. Among the three vertex points of SCMD (Figure 18b), only R presented the pasting properties profile suitable to be used alone in a GF cake formulat ion, to achieve the best OS. S and E must be mixed with another source of starch to reach better values of OS, hence justifying the experimental design adopted in this study. Analyzing the pasting properties profiles of the flours employed in the cake prem ixes (Figure 19), it can be inferred that the choice of R as another source of starch of SCMD was successful. The aim was to achieve at a GF mixed flour that more closely approached the pasting parameters of the flour with gluten. As R has fewer coarse particles (> 250μm) (Figure 20), this may also have contributed to the higher increase in the OS, because the smaller particles are lighter and therefore easier to be carried by air, CO 2, or steam bubbles. Choi and Baik (2013) stated that small flour particle s with a larger total surface area could trap more air bubbles during batter mixing than could coarse particles. This effect was not observed in our results since R did not contribute to decreasing the SG. Nevertheless, R may have contributed to the better bubble distribution, resulting in increased OS. Further investigations would be necessary to corroborate both effects described for the relationship among the flour particle size with the SG and OS.", "Figure 20 - Particle size distribution of the flours used to prepare the cake premixes", "Columns with different script letters, within the same sieve opening, are significantly different according to Tukey’s test (p < 0.05). Source: A self elaboration.", "4.3.2.2 Speci fic volume", "Similar to the OS, the mathematical model of the SV (Table 10) shows that increases in S, R, E, and in the interactions between S and R and R and E caused an increment in the SV. It is noticed that the SV was affected more strongly by R and S variations (F igure 18c). The volume of cake is partly a consequence of the air incorporated in the batter, which agrees with the described results on the SG. Gómez et al. (2008) explained that cake ingredients with higher protein content resulted in a SV value decrease . Among GF flours used, R presented the lowest content of protein and being not significantly different from the flour with gluten (Table 11). This result may contribute to diminish the collapse of the structure during the final stages of the baking proces s or cooling in the cakes with higher amounts of R. Moreover, dietary fiber usually contributes to decreasing the cake volume (GÓMEZ et al ., 2010; ITTHIVADHANAPONG; SANGNARK, 2016). This reduction in the volume might be due to the collapse caused by the f ibers in the air, CO 2, or steam bubbles during baking", "(WALKER et al., 2014). On the other hand, the increase in the dietary fiber in a cake formulation might increment the SV because of its exceptional properties of water absorption and swelling power, which cause high water retention and subsequent increase in the SV (OH et al., 2014). It is also possible that dietary fibers may increase starch gelatinization temperature by reducing the available water for this process, as well as interacting with starch molecules and, thus, promote cake expansion (MAJZOOBI et al., 2016). Dietary fibers can also interact with proteins of GF flours and strengthen the overall structure and, therefore, preserve the volume of GF cakes. Further investigations are required to prove these changes. As GF flours used in this study have different dietary fib er content and WAI value (Table 11), all of them contribute to the enhancement of the SV. Generally, low SV indicates a dense and less attractive crumb, although high SV does not always mean a desirable cake ( BROOKER, 1993 ). A cake with high SV may not be associated with a desirable texture since variations in bubble size and the presence of large bubbles result in an unstable mix, producing cakes of coarse and uneven texture (CONFORTI, 2014). If the bubble does not reach it to the surface, it may instead f orm a tunnel in the cake ( STAUFFER, 1990), which can generate a cake with high SV, but too porous. For the cake, more contact and interaction between starch and water resulted in higher volumes (WILDERJANS et al., 2008). Due to this, the interaction betwee n a flour (R), which presented the lowest values for dietary fiber content and WAI, with flours (S and E) that possess higher values of these parameters (Table 11), promoted an increase in the SV. It is as if the flours act synergistically to increase the SV, i.e., as if there were a compensatory effect of the characteristics abovementioned among R, S, and E. Another feature of the flours that may have contributed to enlarge SV was their particle size distributions because the larger quantities of the flour s were in the finer particle size fractions (≤ 180μm) (Figure 20). Changes in volume may be related to differences in air retention and expansion during the baking process (SEGUNDO et al., 2017), in which the size of particles could impact. This result is in agreement with a study of de la Hera et al. (2013), where it was shown that the finest rice flours produced higher volume GF cakes. It is known that the reduction of flour particle size brings about significant improvements in cake quality, e.g., volume and softness, primarily when the flour is used in high ratio cake recipes (CAUVAIN, 2009). Remarkably, most of the cake formulations reached SV values higher than 2.0 mL/g, approaching the reference cake closely, although some assays", "presented SV values l ower than 2.0 mL/g (Table 9). This result emphasizes the importance of SCMD in the technological study of GF cereal -based cake formulation.", "4.3.2.3 Volume, symmetry and uniformity indices", "As expected, the VI followed a similar tendency as the SV, because t he VI is an indicator of cake volume as well. So, the same parameters that influenced the SV influenced the VI too. VI indicates the amount of air entrapped in cake through the cake crumb (RAHMATI; TEHRANI, 2014). The mathematical model of the VI (Table 10 ) shows that increases in S, R, and E caused an increment in the VI. The difference between the SV and VI models was on the interaction factors: they were between S and E and S, R, and E on the VI. This distinction may be related to the different approache s used to measure these responses. Nonetheless, it can be seen in Figure 18 (c and d) that both cake volume measurement responses have similar profiles, i.e., they are similarly influenced by the characteristics of R, S, and E discussed above.", "The SI show s height differences between central and lateral areas of a cake (DE LA HERA et al., 2013), expressing how flat the surface of a cake is. If the sum of the heights B and D (laterals) were close to twice the height C (central), then we have a SI value near to zero, indicating a flatter surface. The SI values greater than zero indicate a peak neighboring the center of the surface contour of the cake, while SI values less than zero indicate a collapse on the center of the cake surface contour. This collapse wo uld seem to suggest that the cake structure is not stable enough to support its weight after baking (DE LA HERA et al., 2013). Consequently, SI is related to gas retention in the final baking phase (GÓMEZ et al., 2008). As it is possible to observe in Tabl e 9, all cakes presented the SI greater than zero, revealing that the crumb structure of none of them collapsed. It is desirable a SI greater than zero in batter type cakes, in which they present the “grandma’s classic cake format”, that is, a slight peak in the center. In the mathematical model of the SI (Table 10), it is verified that increases in R and E caused an increment in SI. In contrast, S presented a negative interference in this response. The positive interference of R was higher than that of E ( Figure 18e). De la Hera et al . (2013) showed that the finest rice flours produced higher SI in GF cakes. More than 50% of S presented coarse particles (> 250μm) (Figure 20), and this may also have contributed to its negative influence in the SI. The larger particles of S may not have been uniformly distributed in the batter during the baking process, thus hindering both the retention of the formed gas and the water vaporization from the mass, decreasing the", "SI values. Generally, cakes with higher volume exh ibit higher central loaf height (RAHMATI; TEHRANI, 2014), suggesting a causal relationship between the SV and SI. However, this tendency was not observed in this study (Figure 18, c and e). The UI evaluates the distribution of heat inside the oven during t he baking process, expressing if the sides of the cakes grew equally. So, the closer the UI value is to zero, the more uniform the contour of the cake. All of the cakes assessed in this study presented satisfactory uniformity (Table 9), that is, close to z ero. In the mathematical model of the UI (Table 10), it is verified that increases in S, R, and E displayed increment in the UI. In contrast, the interaction between S and R displayed a decrease in the UI. Hence, it is possible to notice that the most unif orm cakes were those that had higher values of S and R together (Figure 18f).", "4.3.2.4 Cake texture", "During a product development process, texture analysis is one of the most helpful analytical methods, as it is suitable to quantify the effects of flour blen ds on the physical properties of the crumb of the bakery products (JEDDOU et al., 2017). The texture can be affected by the cake structure (PIZARRO et al., 2013), with ingredients’ influence on the size and distribution of the air cells within the product structure, which consists of air cells distributed throughout its matrix (SOZER et al ., 2011). Its tender texture characterizes a desirable cake.", "The fir mness (Table 9) test simulates the gentle squeezing by the hand that consumers apply to bakery products and many other food items (BOURNE, 1990). The mathematical model of firmness (Table 10) shows that increases in S, R, and E caused an increment in the f irmness. It is noticed that the firmness was affected more strongly by E variation and followed by the S one (Figure 18g). The influence of flours on the firmness was inversely proportional to the OS, SV, and VI (Figure 18, b, c, d, and g), a theoretically expected result, since as higher are the OS, SV, and SI, the lower the firmness presented by the cake. This result indicates that the improvement in the softness was due both to an increase in height and cake volume. Springiness (Table 9) measures the ela stic recovery of a sample, and it was determined as a ratio of constant force during time holding to peak force before the holding time (SANGNARK; NOOMHORM, 2004). According to this definition, it is possible to infer that a good cake is one that presents higher springiness values. The mathematical model of springiness (Table 10) shows that increases in S, R, and E and, additionally, in the", "interactions between S and R and S and E, displayed increment in springiness. It is also showed a negative interferenc e of the interaction between R and E, as it was expected, since the influence of flours on springiness was directly proportional to OS, SV and VI (Figure 18, b, c, d, and h), while it was inversely proportional to firmness (Figure 18, g and h). It is remar kable that i) R leaves the cake less firm and more elastic, and ii) among the three vertex points of SCMD (Table 11), R was the only flour that most approached the firmness of the reference cake. These observations showed the importance of R in this study once again.", "4.3.2.5 Crumb structure analysis", "The contour, symmetry, and shape of samples can be seen in Figure 21. The quality perceived in a GF cake is considerably related to the appearance of the crumb (GAMBUŚ et al., 2009), as a good cake should show a multitude of evenly distributed minute cells without any large holes (BENNION; BAMFORD, 1997). All the cakes in this study presented good OS, SV, and UI, if they are compared with the reference cake, except for the assay 3 in the OS and SV perceived on th e images. This technological problem occurred because the formulation of the cake premix and the ingredients used to prepare the cake itself, i.e., milk, eggs, and margarine, were based on industrial formulations, which are commercially available already i n Brazil market. The amount of liquids added to the premix is practically standardized on the ingredient list of the commercial premixes, and it was chosen to maintain these quantities in this study. Hence, it can be visually concluded that liquids were la cking so that the assay 3 would obtain better technological parameters, considering it is a batter high ratio type cake. Visually, the assay 3 resembles a brownie cake.", "Figure 21 - Images of sliced cakes", "Ref = reference . See Table 9 for more information about the samples’ descriptions. Source: A self elaboration.", "4.3.3 Quality during shelf -life", "In a shelf -life study of cake premixes, three important parameters should be considered: the M and A w of the cake premixes themselves and the SV of th e cakes. The M and A w are crucial ingredient characteristics because they will dictate the spoilage speed of a food product. As lower these both parameters are, the lower the pace of microbial activities and chemical reactions in the food matrix. Moreover, the rate of reaction of leavening agents is governed by their rate of dissolution (STAUFFER, 1990) . In this way, the contact with the cake premix moisture already initiates the chemical reaction processes by which the chemical leavening act on bakery prod ucts. Cakes prepared from premixes present fluctuation in their quality by the day of their preparation and the day of the premix production. The main reason is that time contributes to decreasing the quality of the final product. Especially for cake premi xes, it is crucial to sustaining the capacity to form a cake with the SV as higher as possible, throughout its storage period.", "The M varied from 3.16 % to 5.16 % and the A w ranged from 0.46 and 0.62 (Table 12). Mathematical models for the M, A w, and SV -Day180 as a function of S, R, and E were found and showed interaction effects (Table 13). In the M and A w, the related impacts to E were the lowest. Hence, an increment in E is the least contributing to increase these responses (Figure 22, a and b), which is desirable to heighten shelf -life related to microbiological, enzymatic, or chemical activities.", "When comparing the SV in Day 0 (Figure 18c) with the SV after 180 days of cake premixes storage (Figure 22c), through mixture contour plots it is concluded tha t i) in Day 0, an increment in any range of E entails a decrease of SV, and ii) in Day 180, an increment of until 50% of E contributes to maintaining SV in the highest values region. Thus, to retain food safety and technological aspects of these cake premi xes, E was shown to be a possible option.

Nowadays people list several reasons to consume GF foods if not for gluten intolerance, for example, i) to have more energy, ii) because it is more natural, iii) to improve athletic performance, iv) to stabilize the mood, v) to treat or improve the skin, or even iv) to manage attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. For most people, adopting a GF diet is not a healthier alternative, accordin g to assorted recent studies. In contrast, for the celiac population can suffer severe intestinal damage and boost their risk of many undesirable medical conditions if they consume products with gluten (SCHIERHORN, 2018). After several years with consumers and producers’ attention focused on gluten absence and sensory characteristics, the nutritional value has also become an essential aspect of GF products (RYBICKA; GLISZCZYŃSKA -ŚWIGŁO, 2017). Currently, the food industry is facing the challenge of developi ng new products with peculiar health strengthening characteristics, given the growing consciousness of the valuable effects of a healthy diet on the quality of life (ALTAN; MCCARTHY; Considering that GF foodstuffs are generally made from ref ined flour and/or starch and are not frequently enriched/fortified, they may not enclose the same levels of nutrients as the gluten -containing equivalents they are expected to replace (GALLAGHER; GORMLEY; ARENDT , 2004). GF products frequently present poor nutritional quality because of the substitution of wheat flour with mainly rice or maize and commercial starches (ARSLAN et al. , 2019; PHIMOLSIRIPOL; MUKPRASIRT; SCHOENLECHNER, 2012). GF products are usually inferior sources of protein and dietary fiber (C ALVO -LERMA et al ., 2019; FRY; MADDEN; FALLAIZE , 2018; MIRANDA et al., 2014). Particularly, GF rice -based formulations have low contents of minerals, proteins, and dietary fiber (PHIMOLSIRIPOL; MUKPRASIRT; SCHOENLECHNER, 2012). Consequently, the nutritional quality improvement of GF rice-based products with other whole -grain GF cereals seems to be unavoidable.", "Recently, there is an appreciation movement to incorporate underutilized crops, such as sorghum, and food industry by -products (namely, fruit pomace) into the human diet, in behalf of the nutritional enrichment, as well as bioactive compounds like phytochemicals (LOHANI; MUTHUKUMARAPPAN, 2016). Despite being historically neglected towards major cereals (TAYLOR; DUODU, 2010), sorghum is an appealing GF c ereal in composite flours due to its bland flavor, color of specific varieties, low allergenicity and capacity to grow in drought -like situations (AZARBAD; TEHRANI; RASHIDI , 2019). Moreover, sorghum contains high bioactive phenolic compounds (TAYLOR et al ., 2014), is high in dietary fiber and has low starch and protein digestibilities in vitro (DUODU et al. , 2003). Food products in which this cereal is added have a high potential to be classified as health -promoting and likely to impart satiating qualities (STEFOSKA -NEEDHAM et al., 2015). In general, fruit pomace has the potentiality to be employed as a food ingredient due to its composition, which is rich in minerals, organic acids, dietary fiber, and phenolic compounds (DJILAS et al ., 2009). Thermoplastic extrusion can act as a possible food processing method to incorporate dry pomace into a variety of raw materials (KAISANGSRI et al ., 2016), such as cereals, and transforming them into intermediate ingredients, for instance, composite flours, or finished pr oducts, like breakfast cereals. This non -wet cooking process can also enhance the sorghum protein digestibility (MESA -STONESTREET; ALAVI; BEAN , 2010). In the context of protein enrichment, the literature contains compelling evidence in support of the excep tional nutritional quality of whey protein, a by-product of cheese, casein, and yogurt manufacture, when compared with other common dietary protein sources (SMITHERS, 2015). This information makes whey powder an attractive ingredient to compose pregelatini zed composite GF flours as well. Snack foods are an essential target for the development of healthy options because they represent an increasing trend in many food markets, as well as GF products, both requiring a more extensive selection of foods high in nutrients, such as whole -grain cereals (POUTANEN; SOZER; DELLA VALLE , 2014). Cakes can be included in an everyday diet in different meals, and their consumption is presently rising, reflecting a consumer market share that is looking for easy and ready -to-make foods with improved sensory and nutritional qualities (ÁVILA et al ., 2017). Due to being versatile bakery goods and, therefore, able to support plenty of modifications in their formulations, cakes become excellent candidates for nutritional improvement through the enrichment with whole -grain cereals and food industry by -products.", "To the best of our knowledge, there is limited research regarding the effect of adding pregelatinized composite flour on the nutritional quality of GF cereal -based cakes made f rom cake premixes. As a result, the present study aimed attention at optimizing cake premix formulations, based on GF cereals (whole -grain sorghum – in natura and pregelatinized – and polished rice), using orange pomace flour and whey powder as nutrients -rich by -products. The objective was to investigate the nutritional and functional characteristics of GF batter high ratio type cakes, assessed by the mixture contour plots.", "5.2 Material and Methods", "5.2.1 Materials", "The ingredients used in the preparation of the cake premixes and of the cakes were: pregelatinized composite flour (E) (prepared as described in Section 5.2.1.2), red sorghum whole -grain (Empório Figueira, São Paulo, Brazil) , whey powder (Laticínios Porto Alegre, Ponte Nova, Brazil), vegetal shorte ning (FRS Alimentos, Barueri, Brazil), alkalized and natural cocoa powders (Pryme Foods, Sorocaba, Brazil), emulsifier (polyglycerol fatty acid esters, mono - and diglycerides of fatty acid and polysorbate 80; Corbion, Araucária, Brazil), sodium acid pyroph osphate and monocalcium phosphate (Diadema Agro Industrial Ltda, Itapecerica da Serra, Brazil) and chocolate and orange aromas (Frutarom do Brasil Indústria e Comércio Ltda, Porto Feliz, Brazil).

In foods derived from plants in general, m ethionine and cysteine are most likely to be limiting, but this is not true of cereal grains (KENT; EVERS, 1994). When pure starches or non -cereal flours are used for the manufacture of GF products, consumers have less access to the abovementioned amino ac ids. Ash content represents the total mineral content in foods (MARSHALL, 2010). According to the results presented in Table 15 it was possible to obtain a mathematical model of ash (Table 16). It shows that increments in S, R, E, and interactions between S and R and R and E increased ash content, while the interaction among these 3 flours displayed a decrease in ash content. It is noticed that ash was affected more strongly by S and E variations (Figure 24b), which can be explained by the employment of who le- grain sorghum, orange pomace flour, and whey powder. It would be expected that whole -grain cereals have more minerals than refined cereals (MARSHALL, 2010). Indeed, Moraes et al. (2015) showed that decorticated sorghum flour has 64% less ash", "than whole -grain sorghum flour, a fact that corroborates the preeminence of whole -grain cereals in the input of macro - and microelements on a diet. The orange pomace flour and whey powder utilized in this study presented 3.59 ± 0.01 and 7.94 ± 0.01 g of as h per 100 g, respectively, contributing to heighten the ash content, and consequently, the minerals content, of the GF cakes. These results reinforce the recovery importance of these by -products and the employment of whole -grain sorghum to improve the nutritional aspects of industrialized foods. In a comparative study of the dietary compositions of a GF diet (GFD) and a non GF diet (non -GFD), Wild et al . (2010) signaled that a GFD delivers lower contents of minerals, especially magnesium, iron, zinc, mangan ese, and selenium. In a study with 50 grain GF products available on the European market, Rybicka and Gliszczyńska -Świgło (2017) found that the content of minerals was generally higher in GF products from buckwheat, millet, chickpea, oats, amaranth, teff, and quinoa than in GF products made from the most popular raw materials like rice and corn. Ash content results of the present study indicate a high potential of our GF cereal -based cake to enter the list of GF products that have higher mineral content.", "Dietary fiber (DF) is a common term for an assortment of plant constituents that are resistant to digestion by human gastrointestinal enzymes (THEUWISSEN; MENSINK, 2008). The results for cakes’ TDF (Table 15) present that all SCMD’s assays can be claimed as a DF source according to the CODEX Alimentarius (FAO/WHO, 1997) because they contain more than 3 g of DF per 100 g, except for the Assay 2. The mathematical model of TDF (Table 16) shows that increases in S, R, E, and the interactions between S and R, S an d E, and R and E caused an increment in TDF. In contrast, the interaction among these 3 flours displayed a decrease in TDF content. It is observed that TDF was influenced more incisively by S and E variations (Figure 24c), due to the utilization of 2 ingre dients rich in TDF: whole -grain sorghum and orange pomace flours. In general, cereals and grains are not a good source of soluble dietary fiber (SDF) (KUMAR et al., 2012). Between 90% and 99% of TDF of whole -grain sorghum is composed of insoluble dietary f iber (IDF) fraction (MARTINO et al ., 2012; MORAES et al ., 2015), with high amounts of glucuronoarabinoxylans (TAYLOR; SCHOBER, T.J., BEAN, 2006). In turn, about 83% of orange pomace’s TDF is IDF fraction, and its SDF fraction is mostly composed of pectin ( CHAU; HUANG, 2003). These data in conjoint suggest that orange pomace flour may have contributed to heightening SDF content in our cereal -based cakes, once again exhibiting", "the rescue importance of the orange pomace into the food industry and justifying it s employment on this study. Besides contributing to give application to the massive bulk of this by -product, the utilization of its fibers is also an opportunity to open new businesses and profits to the food industry (FOSCHIA et al., 2013). Gularte, Gómez , and Rosell (2012) studied rice -based GF layer cakes enriched with legumes (chickpea, pea, lentil, and bean, with rice flour/legume flour, 50:50), reporting TDF values between 1.4 and 2.8 g/100g. It can be inferred that the utilization of whole -grain cere al and orange pomace flour were more efficient in TDF enrichment of GF cakes than legumes, for example. Our TDF results were similar to those found by Saeidi, Nasehi, and Jooyandeh (2018), in which the optimized rice -based GF cake enriched with 25.75% of p omegranate seed powder presented 4.14 g TDF /100g of cake. Their result revealed another potential by -product to produce DF source industrialized GF foods. DF intake is associated with several health outcomes (VERONESE et al ., 2018), as indicated by the lo wer concentrations of inflammatory and oxidative stress markers reported on experiments in animal models (MILLER et al., 2016; XU et al., 2014). As part of a healthy diet, it is essential to promote higher fiber intake (VERONESE et al., 2018). Then, the em ployment of flours that present higher dietary fiber can meet human requirements for healthy foods (ZHANG et al ., 2018). One way to provide adequate amounts of DF to the general population is promoting the increase in DF’s quantities in industrialized food s which is often eaten as snacks or desserts or at breakfast, such as cakes.", "5.3.1.2 In vitro protein digestibility (IVPD)", "Beyond the content, the capacity of digestive enzymes to liberate protein is vital to define the nutritional quality of them (RAFIQ; SHARMA; SINGH, 2017). The IVPD values of the present study reached between 66% and 95% of the Reference cake’s IVPD (Table 15), reinforcing the promising potential that the blended flour composed of any combination of S, R, and E inside the limits of the S CMD has to constitute a GF product of superior or similar quality, regarding the protein -related characteristics. As well as for protein content, it is seen that increases in S, R, and E raise IVPD (Table 16). The positive interference of E in the IVPD was higher than caused by S, indicating a positive correlation between the IVPD and both the whey powder and the thermoplastic extrusion applied on sorghum. Whey powder has a calculated Digestible Indispensable Amino Acid Score (DIAAS) of 96% (value consolida ted from data presented in", "MOUGHAN et al., 2012; FAO, 2013; MARTENS et al., 2014), a piece of evidence in support of the remarkable nutritional quality of whey protein. The poor digestibility of sorghum proteins on cooking is a dietary constraint to the us e of sorghum as food (DUODU et al., 2003). The main obstacle consists in the physicochemical packaging of protein bodies in sorghum grain, which comprise of protease -resistant β - and γ -kafirin (LIU et al ., 2019). Additionally, indigestibility was shown to be related to a greater abundance of disulfide -bonded proteins, especially between the above -cited kafirins (WONG et al ., 2009). Thermoplastic extrusion can be a process used to improve the protein digestibility and, consequently, amino acid availability o f sorghum flour, due to a disruption in the sorghum protein bodies and glutelin matrix (MESA - STONESTREET; ALAVI; BEAN , 2010). Complementarily to protein content, IVPD was positively affected more intensely by R variation (Figure 24d). Our results are simil ar to those shown in the study of Mkandawire et al . (2015), where the authors presented IVPD for ready -to-eat cereals made with sorghum, which encompassed IVPD values between 40% and 60%. This same study displayed that a commercially -available whole -grain oat-based ready -to-eat cereal exhibited 70% of IVPD, being a similar value of our Reference cake’s IVPD. When comparing the cakes’ IVPD of this study with other GF products on the literature, it was found that i) IVPD of the millet pasta ranged between 41 and 50% (CORDELINO et al., 2019), ii) in a biscuit made with amaranth flour, puffed chickpea flour, and potato starch, the reported IVPD value was 60% (SARABHAI; SUDHA; PRABHASANKAR, 2017), and iii) Curiel et al . (2014) published IVPD values for an experim ental GF pasta (made with pregelatinized rice flour and wheat flour rendered GF) and a commercial GF pasta (made with maize and rice flours), being 54.8% and 52.3%, respectively.", "5.3.1.3 Total Phenolic Content", "A large group of compounds containing the phen ol functional group as a fundamental component is formed by phenolic compounds (TAYLOR et al. , 2014). These phytochemicals are perhaps the most important in sorghum. Also, the phytochemical quality of this cereal, such as the content of phenolic compounds and the antioxidant activity, is of particular interest (TAYLOR; DUODU, 2010). In the mathema tical model of TPC (Table 16) found from the results (Table 15), it is verified that increases in S, R, and E displayed an increment in TPC. It is noticed that TPC was affected more strongly by E variation (Figure 24e), which could be explained by the", "thermoplastic extrusion process applied on sorghum and the content of orange pomace flour in E. Extrusion cooking of whole -grains contributes to increase bioactive compounds levels in extruded products, as the shearing caused by this process releases those com ponents from the cereal matrix (BRENNAN et al. , 2011). In its turn, orange pomace is an important source of phenolic compounds (MOLAN; ISMAIL; NSAIF , 2016; SHAHRAM; DINANI, 2019). Consequently, E is showed as a GF pregelatinized composite flour enriched in phenolic compounds, which came from both a whole -grain and a fruit by -product. Regarding the content of phenolics, it is difficult to make direct comparisons between results in literature due to differences in solvents and standards which have been used ( TAYLOR et al. , 2014). Nevertheless, the results presented for TPC in our study are encouraging the development of new GF products enriched in bioactive compounds by utilizing whole -grain cereals, food industry by -products, and thermoplastic extrusion as a processing technology, to create new GF nutritious pregelatinized ingredients.", "5.3.1.4 Antioxidant capacity", "Since antioxidant capacity assays can provide a variety of information about a complex mixture of antioxidants and its synergistic interactions, th ese tests are of growing interest in the study of dietary antioxidant properties (SERRANO; GOÑI; SAURA -CALIXTO , 2007). Researchers consider more than one method to evaluate the real antioxidant capacity of a sample because the current literature undoubtedl y asserts that there are no broadly adopted standardized methods to determine the total antioxidant capacity of foods (CÖMERT; GÖKMEN, 2018). As there are two types of methods to measure the antioxidant capacity ‒ electron transfer based assay (ABTS, DPPH2, FRAP3, CUPRAC4, FCR5) and hydrogen atom transfer -based assay (ORAC, TRAP6) (CÖMERT; GÖKMEN, 2018) ‒ choosing one method in each group may be promising in terms of more robustly expressing the antioxidant capacity of a given sample. The antioxidants pres ent in a sample eliminate ABTS•+ radical cation in the TEAC assay, while the ORAC method calculate the capability of the antioxidants to protect a target protein ‒ fluorescein (3’,6’ -dihydroxyspiro[isobenzofuran -", "2 DPPH: α, α-diphenyl -β-picrylhydrazyl 3 FRAP: Ferric Reducing Antioxidant Power 4 CUPRAC: Copper Reducing Antioxidant Capacity 5 FCR: Folin -Ciocalteu Reagent 6 TRAP:Total Reactive Antioxidant Potential", "1[3H],9’[9H] -xanthen] -3-one ‒ from oxidative injury (ZULUETA; ESTEVE; FRÍGOLA, 2009).", "The results for TEAC of cakes (Table 15) show the importance of employing as much of the whole -grain flour as possible in the formulation of cereal -based foods. The refined flour contains less of streams rich in TDF, vitamins, and phytochemicals, which are health -promoting compounds present in the whole -grain cereal (POUTANEN; SOZER; DELLA VALLE , 2014). The mathematical model of TEAC (Table 16) shows that increments in S, R, and E increase the antioxidant capacity of the samples. At the same time, the inter action among these 3 flours displayed a decrease in TEAC values. It is noticed that TEAC was affected more strongly by S and E variations (Figure 24f). The explanation is also the employment of whole -grain sorghum, orange pomace flour, and whey powder, wit h the same arguments that were discussed during the ash content analysis. Due to behavioral similarities between the mathematical models for ash content and TEAC (Table 16, Figures 1b and 1f), it is suggested that there should be a correlation between the ash content and the antioxidant capacity measured by TEAC. Minerals are bioactive compounds that also have antioxidant activity (FARDET, 2010). In an investigation of selected micronutrients and their related antioxidant capacity, Kaulmann et al. (2014) sh owed that selenium concentrations were well correlated with TEAC in plums (r2 = 0.817, p < 0.01), besides this mineral was an important predictor for antioxidant capacity.", "From the results obtained to the antioxidant capacity measured by ORAC (Table 15) i t was possible to define a mathematical model (Table 16), which shows that increases in S, R, and E displayed an increment in the antioxidant capacity of the samples. It is observed that ORAC was influenced more incisively by S and E variations (Figure 24g ), due to the utilization of 3 ingredients rich in bioactive compounds: whole - grain sorghum and orange pomace flours, as well as whey powder. The role of both whole -grain sorghum and orange pomace flours in improving the antioxidant capacity is similar to the characteristics discussed for TPC, because there is a strong correlation between TPC and the antioxidant activity (BARROS; FERREIRA; GENOVESE , 2012; MOLAN; ISMAIL; NSAIF , 2016; YAĞCI; GÖĞÜS, 2009). In turn, the antioxidant activity of whey is primarily linked to thiol groups of β -lactoglobulin, the main whey protein (FARDET; ROCK, 2018). In the present study, it is also possible to infer a correlation between the TPC and the antioxidant capacity measured by ORAC, due to", "noticeable resemblances between t he mathematical models and the mixture contour plots for TPC and ORAC (Table 16, Figures 1e and 1g).", "It is important to highlight that DF and the antioxidant capacity of samples cannot be treated separately (MACAGNAN; SILVA; HECKTHEUER , 2016). These two dietary factors produce synergistic effects within the gastrointestinal tract, as they follow some common physiological processes (QUIRÓS -SAUCEDA et al ., 2014). Hence, it is feasible to conclude that the TDF content present in our GF cakes also positively i mpacts the antioxidant capacity measured by both TEAC and ORAC methods. Furthermore, whole -grain sorghum could be more useful than refined cereals for preventing diseases in which free radicals play a key role (FARDET; ROCK; RÉMÉSY , 2008), due to the prese nce of various bioactive compounds, as indicated by nutritional and clinical studies (BRENNAN et al. , 2011).", "5.3.1.5 Other relevant information", "Fardet (2014) suggested that it would be interesting to engineer a cereal -based product with more fiber than is present in whole -grain wheat products because it is high the consumption of grain -derived products and other cereals, often in refined form. Moreover, he stated that a more sustainable cereal sector would preserve the environment and promote health, practi ces which the author called environmental and physiological sustainabilities. A combined analysis of all nutritional and functional characteristics displayed in the present study indicates that our GF cereal -based cakes meet all the above -named demands thr ough the employment of whole -grain sorghum, orange pomace flour, and whey powder, even after these ingredients underwent two thermal processes (thermoplastic extrusion and baking).", "For the parameters moisture, lipids, and carbohydrates, it was p ossible to verify through the analysis of the effects (Appendix 2) that S, R, and E contributed to increasing the contents of these parameters. However, it was not possible to define fitted regression models.", "5.3.2 Validation of the mathematical models", "It can be seen that the experimental values for protein, ash, IVPD, TPC, TEAC, and ORAC and these values predicted by the models did not present significant differences in the single sample Student’s t -test (p > 0.05) (Table 17). Therefore, we may consider as validated the models for protein, ash, IVPD, TPC, TEAC, and ORAC.", "As for the TDF, although it cannot be assessed through single sample Student’s t -test, it presented a low relative deviation.", "Table 17 - Experimental values and the values predicted by th e fitted regression models for nutritional and functional parameters of the cakes Parameters Experimental values Values predicted by the fitted regression models Relative deviation Protein Ash TDF IVPD TPC TEAC ORAC aMeans followed by the same letter on a row are statistically equal at 5% significance according to single sample Student’s t -test.

It is usually known as a livestock feed, and it is also used in ethanol production rather than a cereal grain fo r human diets, especially in most industrialized countries and in some developing countries (RATNAVATHI; PATIL, 2013; STEFOSKA -NEEDHAM et al ., 2015; TAYLOR; SCHOBER; BEAN , 2006). In contrast, it is the primary grain used in the production of, for instance, bread, popped sorghum, couscous, porridge, and beer, in some parts of the semi -arid tropics of Africa and Asia (RANI; KUMAR; SABIKHI , 2016; TAYLOR; SCHOBER; BEAN , 2006). In essence, sorghum is more sustainable than other crops due to its tolerance for dro ught and high temperature ( MEDEIROS; VÁZQUEZ -ARAÚJO; CHAMBERS IV , 2011; TAYLOR; SCHOBER; BEAN , 2006). Nevertheless, despite its lower cost and more manageable production, sorghum is considered a marginal crop because its global consumption is small when co mpared with wheat and maize, for example (ANUNCIAÇÃO et al., 2017; CHÁVEZ et al., 2018). Medeiros, Vázquez -Araújo, and Chambers IV (2011) stated, about sorghum, that the food industry is neglecting a cost - effective, healthy and sustainable source that coul d be advantageous for industry and well accepted by consumers as well. Recently, new opportunities arise for using sorghum as a raw material for human food, due to its environmental sustainability and to the increasing interest in healthy and functional fo ods ( VÁZQUEZ -ARAÚJO; CHAMBERS IV; CHERDCHU , 2012). One way to increase the consumption of sorghum and reach a broad segment of the population is to incorporate this cereal into foods that can be easily included in the diet and are already widely consumed, as bakery products.", "A new product can be classified as “science -push” or “consumer pull” in its development process ( WENNSTROM, 2000). Sorghum -based products could be categorized into both market patterns because i) there are scientific pieces of evidence that this cereal has excellent nutritional and functional characteristics (TAYLOR et al., 2014), and ii) the demand from consumers is p ulled to make science understand that they need these new GF products ( MEDEIROS; VÁZQUEZ -ARAÚJO; CHAMBERS", "IV, 2011). During the development of an increasing whole -grain and dietary fiber product, a crucial aim is to combine proper nutrition profiles with p leasurable sensory perception (POUTANEN; SOZER; DELLA VALLE, 2014). A great challenge for the food industry is the improvement of GF products, and the studies on this subject have been on the rise (CHÁVEZ et al ., 2018). There is an increasing demand for GF products; however, there are not enough options for this market share. Also, they are not good -quality food (NASCIMENTO; FIATES; TEIXEIRA , 2017), since consumers usually perceive their technological, nutritional, and sensory characteristics as worse than those presented by the wheat -based products. It is valuable to ensure that GF products offer essential attributes for a good sensory qualification, which comprises acceptable appearance, aroma, flavor, and texture (PAGLIARINI; LAUREATI; LAVELLI , 2010). The re is a limited number of technical publications that assess sorghum products using sensory techniques, and this could be attributed to the fact that only recently researchers are concerned about combining good sensory appeal with health benefits in foods using sorghum (CHÁVEZ et al ., 2018). In this new context, sensory analysis is indispensable to promote the project of developing sorghum -based products ( VÁZQUEZ -ARAÚJO; CHAMBERS IV; CHERDCHU , 2012). Therefore, work on sensory profiles of sorghum -based prod ucts and consumer acceptance is needed to help them succeed ( MEDEIROS; VÁZQUEZ -ARAÚJO; CHAMBERS IV , When the aim is to obtain a quick sensory characterization during a product development, the descriptive methods with consumers are very helpful. The y have gained importance because they can provide analogous sensory maps to traditional descriptive analyses, with lower expenses and saving time ( MELLO; ALMEIDA; MELO , 2019; VARELA; ARES, 2012) . In this scene, the check -all-that-apply (CATA) method has be en established to be fairly effective (VALENTIN et al., 2012; VARELA; ARES, 2012). This technique consists in a list of easy -to-understand words or phrases, which can be selected when considered by the consumers as appropriate to describe the sample, witho ut any limitation on the number of choices (SANTOS et al ., 2015). Considering that the developed food product will be launched for sale, applying the CATA method is a reasonable approach since it depicts the product’s profile by the impressions of the cons umers (ARES; VARELA, 2017). Moreover, it is common to correlate the descriptive portrait given by CATA with consumer hedonic responses to", "identify the drivers of liking and disliking (ARES; JAEGER, 2015; VALENTIN et al., Cakes are among the most pop ular bakery items, being virtually consumed by people of all social strata (JEDDOU et al., 2017) and appealing to children, teenagers, adults, and elderly ones (ÁVILA et al., 2017). As far as we know, there are no studies on sensory analysis of GF sorghum -based cakes which were prepared from cake premixes.

This was the strate gy adopted in order to characterize the sensory profiles of the samples evaluated in the present study.", "The samples that obtained the lowest (p<0.05) acceptances means (OAI, appearance, aroma, flavor, and texture) (Tables 2 and 3) and purchase intention re sults (Figure 26) were 3S+97E and 100E, that is, the nutritional and the functional optimizations, respectively. Another relevant result presented in Table 19 is the finding that the OAI acceptance means of the samples that combined the technological optim ization with the nutritional (3S+39R+58E) or with the functional (40R+60E) optimizations did not differ (p>0.05) from the OAI acceptance mean of the merely technological optimization sample (20S+80R). These two aforementioned results reveal i) the technolo gical optimization importance during the development and the formulation of the cake premixes, because the technological optimization has resulted in higher OAI acceptance means and purchase intention results of the GF cakes, and ii) the nutritional or fun ctional optimizations solely are not positively reflected in the OAI acceptance means, because these formulations do not aggregate valuable technological characteristics to the final product, such as higher results for oven spring, specific volume and spri nginess and low values for firmness, for example. The food industry should avoid that the nutritional and/or functional information provided to consumers induces to high expectations, because the product may not be appreciated due to its sensory properties (VÁZQUEZ -ARAÚJO; CHAMBERS IV; CHERDCHU , 2012). In their study, Vázquez -Araújo, Chambers IV, and Cherdchu (2012) showed that sensory", "properties were most valued by consumers, followed by the health attributes presented by products made with sorghum. Even though private industry and academic institutions have aimed attention to increasing the nutritional quality of processed foods and have made efforts to understand theirs nutritional and functional benefits better, it is important to refine the products’ s ensory properties in an endeavor to appeal to consumers (CIVILLE; OFTEDAL, 2012).", "Another assessment that must be highlighted is the comparison among the samples 3S+39R+58E (technological and nutritional), 40R+60E (technological and functional), and 20S+80 R (technological). The nutritional and the functional characteristics of the samples 3S+39R+58E (technological and nutritional) and 40R+60E (technological and functional) are better than those found in the sample 20S+80R (technological) because the first t wo have more minerals, protein, total dietary fiber, free phenolic compounds and antioxidant capacity and less carbohydrates than the last one. Hence, besides offering the desirable technological characteristics to the consumers, the samples 3S+ 39R+58E (technological and nutritional) and 40R+60E (technological and functional) also: i) contribute to the nutritional and the functional improvement of the cakes; and ii) assist in a greater insertion of whole -grain sorghum flour in the GF cake formula tions.", "The acceptance test results for appearance, aroma, flavor, and texture (Table 19) suggest that the consumers presented a greater potential to discriminate appearance and flavor than to differentiate aroma and texture. The following interpretations a re possible: i) greater importance may be hinted for appearance and flavor rather than for aroma and texture; and/or ii) appearance and flavor really differed more among the samples and, thus, the consumers were able to discriminate them more easily. The pairs of samples most similar to each other, concerning the formulation [pair 1: 3S+97E (nutritional) with 100E (functional); and pair 2: 3S+39R+58E (technological and nutritional) with 40R+60E (technological and functional)], did not significantly differ (p>0.05) from each other within their pairs for appearance, aroma, flavor, and texture (Table 19). It is important to underline that the appearance means (Table 19) of the samples that combined the technological optimization with the nutritional (3S+39R+58 E) or with the functional (40R+60E) optimizations were higher (p<0.05) than the appearance mean of the technological optimization sample (20S+80R). In contrast, the texture means (Table 19) of these samples presented no significant differences (p>0.05) amo ng them, being also favorable results for 3S+39R+58E", "(technological and nutritional) and 40R+60E (technological and functional) samples. Ares and Varela (2017) reported that when an attribute is present at approximately the same intensity between samples, the samples may not be discriminated for such attributes. For instance, Mello, Almeida, and Melo (2019) found that for smaller formulation differences, trained assessors perceived more (p<0.01) attributes presenting significant differences than consumers. These characteristics of descriptive sensory methods using consumers, such as CATA in the present study, can be taken into account in the case of the aroma attributes since the aromas were added in the same concentration in all premix cake formulations. Al so regarding aroma, Reference (with gluten) and 20S+80R (technological) samples did not differ significantly (p>0.05) from each other as well, which can be explained by a large amount of rice, which is a fairly neutral -flavored cereal, in the formulation o f 20S+80R (technological) sample. This fact that did not allow consumers to differentiate significantly (p>0.05) a cake mostly prepared with wheat (Reference – with gluten) from a cake mainly produced with rice (20S+80R – technological).", "Consumers were able to discriminate samples in up to 4 difference levels in 29 attributes (Table 20). All attributes in which there was a significant difference (p<0.05) among samples on OAI for the Total Group (n=151) (Figure 28) were differentiated into 3 or 4 levels (Table 20), with the exception for the attributes sweet aroma and moist texture. These results suggest the importance that greater differentiation could imply on the drivers of liking and disliking. Both sweet aroma and moist texture presente d less strong positive influence (Figure 28). The sweet aroma of Reference (with gluten) and 20S+80R (technological) samples did not differ significantly (p>0.05). Also, this attribute did not differ significantly (p>0.05) among all the GF samples (Table 2 0). At the same time, the moist texture was significantly different (p<0.05 for Cochran’s Q test) among all samples, however the difference in pairs (p>0.05 for McNemar test) was not detected. This result may also indicate that all samples were satisfactor y regarding these attributes and, therefore, they were positive drivers of liking.", "The first dimension of the correspondence analyses (CA) (Figure 27) showed the differentiation of 3S+97E (nutritional) and 100E (functional) samples from the rest, in the To tal Group (n=151) and the two segmented groups, showing that these samples were the ones that differed most among all the evaluated samples.

In comparison, the sam ple 100E (functional) was more characterized by 3 attributes (Figure 27b), none of them being part of the drivers of disliking (Figure 28b). This examination could suggest that for Group 1 the drivers of disliking (Figure 28b) were not sufficient to decrea se the acceptance mean of the sample 3S+97E (nutritional) compared to the sample 100E (functional). This result was observed only within Group 1 (Table 19). Moreover, the results of this study showed that the consumers in Group 1 were more capable of discr iminating samples with subtle differences.", "The second dimension of the CA (Figure 27) separated the 20S+80R (technological) sample from Reference (with gluten), 3S+39R+58E (technological and nutritional), and 40R+60E (technological and functional) samples, in the Total Group (n=151) and the two segmented groups. One of the attributes which characterized the 20S+80R (technological) sample, in the Total Group and the segmented groups, was sandy (Figure 27). This attribute is owing to the functional similarity between sorghum and corn starches (PÉREZ; LARES; GONZÁLEZ, 1997). The samples 3S+39R+58E (technological and nutritional) and 40R+60E (technological and functional) were not characterized by sandy (Figure 27). However, they had more sorghum than the sample 20S+80R (technological), suggesting that the thermoplastic extrusion treatment of sorghum might be efficient to eliminate this attribute, frequently rated as a defect of GF products made with sorghum (FERREIRA et al ., 2016; GIRARD; AWIKA, 2018; WINGER et al., 2014).", "According to Figure 27, consumers were generally unable to detect small deviations, such as minor changes in formulations, as suggested by Guerrero (2017). Nevertheless, Group 1 (n=72) might have been able to detect a difference between 3S+39R+ 58E (technological and nutritional) and 40R+60E (technological and functional) samples and between 3S+97E (nutritional) and 100E (functional) samples. In turn, Group 2 (n=79), between 3S+97E (nutritional) and 100E (functional) samples (Table 19), given tha t these groups presented significantly different acceptance means (p<0.05) for these pairs of samples, even though the differences perceived by Groups were not detected in the CATA attributes evaluated.", "It is meant to highlight the importance of the aromas and the flavors (chocolate and orange) on the drivers of liking (Figure 28), as they were deliberately added to the", "cake premix formulations. They had a positive impact on the evaluation of samples, confirming that they are usually desirable in various ce reals products (BOWER; WHITTEN, 2000; VÁZQUEZ -ARAÚJO; CHAMBERS IV; CHERDCHU , 2012), including to mask the cereal aroma, which was pointed out as a driver of disliking (Figure 28).", "For both segmented groups, the Reference (with gluten) sample was more chara cterized by 4 attributes (Figures 27b and 27c). All of them were part of the drivers of liking pointed out by Group 1 (n=72) (Figure 28b) (attractive, soft appearance, soft/fluffy and surface uniformity). In contrast, Group 2 (n=79) pointed out 3 attribute s among the drivers of liking (Figure 28c) (attractive, soft appearance and soft/fluffy). This investigation might suggest an explanation for the Group 1 have presented a higher (p<0.05) OAI acceptance mean than for Group 2 for the Reference sample (Table 19). Reference (with gluten) sample is the one that intrinsically carries the consumer’s taste memory since the vast majority of cakes consumed in Brazil are made with wheat flour. In this way, it does not surprise the results presented by the affective te st and the purchase intention, in which the Reference (with gluten) sample showed the best outcomes (Table 19 and Figure 26). These results corroborate with the inference of Matos, Sanz, and Rosell (2014), which stated that consumers are progressively dema nding GF foods comparable to the long -established gluten ones. In a study conducted by Vázquez -Araújo, Chambers IV, and Cherdchu (2012) to determine the aspects of sorghum that consumers consider important in food products, most respondents demanded simila r sensory characteristics to the grain products currently found in the market. Even though the consumers in the present study did not have the information that the cakes they were evaluating were mostly GF (except for the Reference – with gluten – sample), they reinforced the idea that there is still a need for improvement in the formulation of GF cakes. The goal is that they equate themselves with the cakes with gluten, regarding the acceptance.", "References ANUNCIAÇÃO, P.C; CARDOSO, L.M.; GOMES, J.V.P; LUCIA,C.M.D.; CARVALHO, C.W.P.; GALDEANO, M.C.; QUEIROZ, V.A.V.; ALFENAS, R.C.G.; MARTINO, H.S.D.; PINHEIRO - SANT’ANA, H.M..

D epending on the S, CM , and T conditions, they presented different ph ysical characteristics and pasting properties, which may m eet the distinct specificities of the diverse applications in the food industry. The thermoplastic extrusion revealed itself as a unit operation efficient for the processing of two by -products of the food industry, one with a high level of dietary fibers ( orange pomace flour) and the other with a high level of protein (whey powder), through the incorporation of these two ingredients into a starchy matrix (sorghum). Since the proteins and fibers may have caused a damping effect on shear rate, it is feasible that gelatinization has overcome granular disorganization, preventing the starch from degrading. The results indicate the perspective of offering both the food industry and customers new GF cereal flours, for instance , in bakery, confectionery, desserts, gravies, soups, dairy products, sausages, etc., with excellent technological characteristics and sustainable claim, easily suiting a ‘clean label’. Although the nutritional parameters were not evaluated, it is assumed that the fibers were degraded into low molecular weight compounds, due to the transformations presented in the technological properties. It would be interesting to have a later study in which this evaluation is made.", "R was shown to be an important cereal in this study, as it improved many of th e technological properties of cake (OS, SV, VI, SI, UI, firmness , and springiness) discussed here. Therefore, if the main objective is the introduction of an unconventional cereal, such as sorghum, in industrialized food products, the use of R is suggested to increase the technological quality of GF cereal -based cakes. Regardless of this fact, it is essential to highlight that the use of a higher amount of liquid ingredients in the cake preparation could improve the technological characteristics of the prod ucts in which there were more S and /or E.", "One optimized technological formulation for GF cake premixes have been suggested, in which the optimal flour formulation for the cake premixes was R = 80 % and S = 20 %. Although S and E have presented worse tech nological yields than R, they have gre at potential in cake production. It is essential to carry future studies that increase the amount of liquids in the formulations, for example, main ly because it was proved that E extend ed the shelf life of the cake pre mix. These technological evidences", "could also act as a catalyst for the uptake and demand for sorghum by the food industry and consumers.", "The nutritional and functional study showed that sorghum in natura (S) and pregelatinized composite flour (E, containi ng 87.8 % of sorghum, 7.2 % of orange pomace flour and 5 % of whey powder) were very effective on the improvement of the nutritional and functional character istics of GF cereal -based cakes. They presented competitive values of protein, ash, TDF, TPC , and a ntioxidant capacities, comparing to their gluten -containing counterpart. Two optimized formulations for GF cake premixes have been suggested. For the nutritional optimization, the optimal flour formulation for the cake premixes was S = 3% and E = 97% . In c ontrast, the optimized functional formulation employed only E. Both optimized formulations highlighted the nutritional and functional preeminence of whole -grain sorghum over polished rice. The employment of an ancient whole -grain together with two food ind ustry by -products seems to contribute with critical health -promoting properties to GF cereal -based cakes, which may also help to increase people’s dietary diversification, and, consequently, to the sustainability of food industry.", "Concerning the acceptance, it was observed that, when consumers were segmented into two groups, one group showed to be more critical, with lower acceptance means and more numerous and more intense influences of the drivers of disliking . Meanwhile , the other group showed to be more capable of discriminating samples with subtle differences, presenting greater discrimination regarding OAI acceptance. Future studies with more consumers might verify if these profiles are linked with inherent characteristics to each consumer, s uch as the level of education, social class , and knowledge of food, for example. The sensory study showed that there was an improvement in the sensory properties of the GF samples in which the nutritional or functional characteristics were optimized togeth er with the technological characteristics, resulting in higher acceptance means . This result emphasizes the importance of the technological optimization of the formulation of sorghum -based cake premixes because the nutritional or functional optimizations d id not present technological characteristics that reflect on the increase of the acceptance. It can be inferred that the novel and great technological contribution of this study is related to the use of a pregelatinized sorghum flour since the thermoplasti c extrusion treatment seems to be efficient to defeat the sandy attribute, which is negatively evaluated in sorghum -based food. Therefore, it is confirmed that sensory studies are indispensable to confront the challenge of developing", "sorghum -based foods wi th sensory characteristics desired by consumers. Moreover, the results showed that it is possible to offer a GF cake premix that presents good nutritional, functional , and technolo gical qualities, in which whole -grain sorghum can be the main cereal. Finall y, it is concluded that this product has the potential to be offered as a novelty by the food industry, given that most consumers in this study stated that they did not know sorghum.", "APPENDIXES", "APPENDIX 1 Effects analysis and their statistical significances to the responses related to the assessment of the extrusion process and of the pregelatinized mixed flour to which it was not possible to obtain mathematical models that explained the in fluence of the independen t variabl e (Chapter 3) .

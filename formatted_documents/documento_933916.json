Thesis (Doctor of Science, D.Sc.). Chemistry Institute, Federal University of Rio de Janeiro.", "Demand for sustainable and biodegradable products build with renewable resources has become an important effort to reduce the impact of food packaging on the environment. In this context, the search for more effective technologies for the preparation of biocomposites should be directed towards improving film properties . Initially, this work aimed to evaluate two concentrations of commercial microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) applied to starch and chitosan films with the application of moderate electric field (MEF) and ultrasonic bath. It was observed that the addition of different concentrations of MCC and the application of MEF were responsible for changes in the properties o f the films, being this effect dependent on the polysaccharide used. The use of MEF was efficient in reducing water vapor permeability in MCC -free chitosan films , as well as in producing more hydrophobic surface films. MCC addition promoted more opaque, rigid, less flexible and less hydrophobic films. Starch and MEF films were more hydrophilic with lower tensile strength and Young's modulus. MCC films were more opaque, less flexible and less hydrophilic than pure films. The composites showed good thermal properties, which increases their potential for use as packaging materials.", "Therefore, the incorporation of MCC in polysaccharide films, as well as the application of MEF, proved to be an interesting approach to alter the properties of the films. Viticultu re involves the generation of significant amounts of solid waste and it is attractive to use the bagasse by-product as option for development of new materials with the ability to improve packaging performance. Thus, this work aimed to obtain, characterize and evaluate the application of cellulose nanocrystals from grape pomace . Pinot Noir grape bagasse was subjected to a chemical pretreatment associated with acid hydrolysis and ultrasound treatment to obtain cellulose nanocrystals (CNC) with 80.1% of cellul ose recovered from the bagasse. This nanomaterial was characterized by needle -shaped structures, dispersed suspensions, high aspect ratio crystals, high crystallinity and thermal stability. Subsequently, cellulose nanocrystals from Alicante Bouschet grape bagasse obtained by acid hydrolysis were characterized and added in starch -based filmogenic solutions (1, 2, 5, 10 and 15g / 100g of starch). Results of this test showed a continuous increase in the crystallinity index in the purified cellulose and the obt ained CNCs, confirming the progressive removal of amorphous non -cellulosic materials (lignin, hemicellulose and other impurities) present in the bagasse. CNCs added to starch matrix produced films with lower water vapor permeability and the addition of up to 10% formed less hydrophilic films. Films with 5 to 15% of CNCs were more opaque and with better tensile strength and Young's modulus. The incorporation of CNC has improved mechanical properties and decreased water vapor permeability, important character istics for food packaging materials. Thus, a case study was elaborated with the application of these filmogenic solutions as coating on strawberries of Mohaven cultivar. Starch -only coating reduced fruit weight loss. CNC reinforcement did not improve the w ater vapor barrier properties of fruits. The addition of CNCs in the filmogenic solutions maintained the physical and chemical properties of the strawberries as well as the color characteristics of the coated fruits within 12 days and showed a reduction in the count. control. Thus, further research should be recommended for the use of the proposed nanocomposites, showing that nanocrystals can be used in coating formulations.", "Keywords : agroindustrial waste , edible coatings , nanocomposites, postharvest , ohmic heating.", "FIGURE LIST Chapter 1 Figure 1.

Introduction", "The use of packaging and coatings for food plays a key role in its protection and preservation, aiming to extend its shelf life, maintain product quality and reduce value chain losses (Nandi & Guha, 2018) . Packaging also serves to attract consumers and provide them with nutritional and commercial information.", "The terms coatings and films are often used without distinction. Film production is based on evaporation of the solvent from the filmogenic solution by casting , extrusion or blowing to form a film with a smooth surface, which is subsequently used to wrap the food; whereas a coating is formed from a solution applied directly to the food surface, leading to the formation of a thin film layer (Allesteros et al., 201 8). Recently, demand for packaging made from renewable and biodegradable resources has become more important in response to increased awareness of the polluting impact of these packages on the environment (Souza et al. 2010) and the rapid growth of waste disposal. In response, the food industry continually seeks to develop new packaging products with sustainable appeal.", "In this context, biopolymers are potential substitutes for petroleum -based packaging materials due to their abundant and renewable availability, low cost, biodegradability and biocompatibili ty (Souza et al. 2010; Shankar & Rhim, 2016) . However, developing packaging materials consisting solely of biomolecules made from low -cost renewable raw materials is a challenge that can be solved only with a multidisciplinary approach, by integrating knowledge from different fields to meet these expectations as well as supply the p ackaging and coating market (Cerqueira, Pereira, Ramos, Teixeira, & Vicente, 2016) . The main biopolymers used for this purpose are listed in Table 1.", "Table 1. Some natural biopolymers used for food packaging and coatings Type of polysaccharide Chemical structure Reference Starch Rico et al. (2016) Chitosan Hamed et al. (2016) Cellulose George & Sabapathi (2015) Alginate Deepa et al. (2016)", "Chitosan is commercially obtained from partial deacetylation in the presence of a chitin base (removal of acetyl groups) from the exoskeletons of crustaceans such as crabs and shrimp (Tayel et al., 2016) . It is a biodegradable biopolymer with attractive characteristics for the food industry, especially as packaging material, due to its excellent film forming performance, antimicrobial activity, non -toxicity and low oxygen permeability (Dehnad, Mirzaei, Emam - Djomeh, Jafari, & Dadashi, 2014 ; Giannakas et al., 2016) .", "Starch, a biopolymer widely available in nature, can be obtained from a variety of plant sources such as cereals, roots and t ubers. It is a renewable, cheap and biodegradable product (Rico et al., 2016) . It is formed by two types of glucose polymers, amylose and amylopectin. Starch films have been intensively investigated since they are considered promising for film production because of their low cost and ability to form opaque, resistant and biodegradabl e films (Yun & Yoon, 2010; Shi, Wang, Li, & Adhikari, 2013) .", "Films developed from polysaccharides have some performance limitations related to their hydrophilicity, which causes high water absorption and high water vapor permeability. The mechanical properties of the film are also considered important factors, such as deformability, tensile strength and elongation percentage (Elsabee & Abdou, 2013 ; Nandi & Guha, 2018) . Some strategies have been applied to improve these properties, like the addition of plasticizers (Cerqueira, Souza, Teixeira, & Vicente, 2012) , blending with other polymers (Giannakas et al., 2016) and incorporation of oils, micro and nanoparticles (Elsabee & Abdou, 2013 ; Shankar & Plasticizers are incorporated into filmogenic solutions in order to improve fi lm flexibility and extensibility, reduce intermolecular forces and increase mobility of polymer chains. However, the addition of plasticizers should be carefully studied, since it may increase gas and water vapor permeability and possibly interfere with the mechanical properties of the film (Souza Microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) and cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) can be used as compatible filler material for biopolymers, acting as mechanical reinforcement (Ma, Chang, & Yu, 2008 ; Rico et al., 2016) . The effectiveness of these materials is associated with the nature of the polymer (cellulose) such as crystallinity index ( CrI), and the characteristics of the fiber/matrix interface (Chuayjuljit , Su-Uthai , & Charuchinda , 2010) .", "Agroindustrial residues, consisting mainly of plant cell wall polysaccharides such as cellulose, can be important sources to obtain cellulose micro and nanoparticles (Elanthikkal et al., 2010) . The incorporation of these materials can improve film properties for as packaging. Thus, the reuse of residues from agribusiness reduces the disposal of these materials, besides being a more economical option to incorporate biodegradable materials in the formulation of products and improve their characteristics.", "Concomitantly, new film processing methods have been studied, aiming to better elucidate the de velopment of these materials and the production of films with better characteristics. The use of ohmic treatment (OH), also known as moderate electric field (MEF) treatment, has aroused the interest of researchers (Souza, Cerqueira, Teixeira, & Vicente, 2010; Souza et al., 2010) . This technology is based on the passage of an electric current through a medium that has electrical resistance. The electric energy is converted into heat, so that the heating of the sample at the moment of processing occurs as a function of the current that passes through the material (Souza et al. 2010; Pereira, Souza, Cerqueira, Teixe ira, & Vicente, 2010) .", "The application of OH in filmogenic solutions can alter the structure and physical properties of the films produced, giving them characteristics such as higher CrI and lower water vapor permeability values (Souza et al., 2010) . Thus, OH has a functional and supporting role, contributing to the formation of good -quality films, with the potential to preserve the properties of foods and increase their shelf life. Some studies report the application of OH in the production of protein and polysaccharide films, as well as in the production of food coating solutions (García et al., 2009 ; Souza et al., 2009; Souza et al ., 2010; Pereira et al., 2010), in which the materials showed sign ificant improvements in their properties such as permeability and mechanical parameters. However, studies of the application of this technology in chitosan/cellulose and starch/cellulose composites are still scarce.", "Within this context, this work aimed to evaluate the application of moderate electric fields , ultrason bath and the incorporation of MCC in starch and chitosan film solutions, to obtain CNCs from wine and agroindustrial residue, and to study the use of CNCs as filler and reinforcement in starch films and the effect of applying these nanocomposites for coating strawberries stored under refrigeration.", "2.

This work was carried out at the University of Minho in Portugal.

The structure of the thesis is represented in Figure 1.", "Figure 1. Thesis Structure", "4. Theoretical Framework", "4.1 Utilization of waste from wine makin", "4.1.1 Grapes: Classification and production", "Grape ( Vitis vinifera L) is one of the most cultivated and consumed crops in the world, both for fresh consumption and processing. Its arrival in Brazil dates to the 16th century, when the first European varieties were introduced by the Portuguese. In 1875, the production of g rapes and wine gained more importance in Brazilian agriculture with the arrival of Italian immigrants, thus increasing the production and economic importance of this activity, with the consequent improvement in the quality of wines (Kuck, 2016) .", "The grape vine belongs to the order Vitales, family Vitaceae, which comprises 11 genera and 450 species. Vitis is the oldest genus, originating from temperate zones of the northern hemisphere (America, Europe and Asia), with about 50 species (Teles, 2014) ; It has edible fruits and is of great economic importance, as it includes species that are consumed as fresh or dried fruit and also in the form o f wine and juice (Cordeiro , 2015) . Vitis vinifera L., of European origin, is characterized by wide morphological and physiological variability, with excellent quality fruits suitable for the production of wines. In turn, Vitis labrusca , of North American origin, is suitable mainly for fresh consumption (t able grapes) and rootstock (Nunes, Rodr igues, & Oliveira, 2017; Fortes & Pais, 2015) .", "The cultivar ' Pinot Noir ' is a red variety of Vitis vinifera L, originated in the Burgundy region of France, where there are traces of cultivation since the 4th century. It has small, compact, cylindrical clusters with medium to small berry size (Rauscedo , 2014) . It is one of the main varieties for making “blancs de noir” (red grape white wines) and traditional French champagnes (Cordeiro , 2015) .", "'Alicante Bouschet ' is also an ink variety of Vitis vinifera L., of French origin. It is generally used in cuts to add color to the wine. It has medium size bunches in a conical and compact format, while the berries are medium in size, and unlike most cultivars, they accumulate pigments in the skin as well as the pulp (Rauscedo, 2014) . In Brazil, this cultivar is commercially grown in the Serra Gaucha region and the São Francisco Valley (Dachi, 2015) .", "In 2017, world grape production was 87.43 Mton, with China (13.16 Mton), Italy (7.16 Mton), USA (6.67 Mton), France (5.91 Mton) and Spain (5.38 Mton) being the top five producers According to the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE, 2018) , the Brazilian production of grapes for processing (wine, juice, jelly) in 2017 was 846,384,099 tons, the main producing states being Rio Grande do Sul (769,347,908 tons), Santa Catarin a (42,800,666 tons) and Pernambuco (21,001,700 tons). Regarding table grape production, Brazil had production of 349,428,716 tons, mainly from the states of Pernambuco (158,310,074 tons), São Paulo (57,412,465 tons) and Bahia (51,528 tons).", "Grape growing i s one of the main agro -economic activities in the world and about 15% of global production goes to the wine industry (Teixeira et al., 2014) . World wine production in 2018, according to the International Organization of Vine and Wine (OIV), was 28.2 billion liters. The main producing country was Italy, with 48.5 million liters, followed by France (46.4 million liters) and Spain (40.9 million li ters) (OIV, 2018).", "4.1.2. Waste generated by viticulture and potential reuse", "Viticulture generates significant amounts of solid waste (up to 30% w/w of material used) (Teixeira et al., 2014) . Bagasse (Figure 2) is the main byproduct of the wine industry. This residue consists of stems, skin, pulp and seeds remaining after pressing. Other byproducts from grape processing include vines (from pruning), winery sludge (wine lees), effluents and filt ration residues (Dávila et al., 2017) .", "Figure 2. Primary winemaking byproduct: Grape pomace (Source: Author)", "Knowing the generated byproduct is important for those who use a proper destination for the recovery and, consequently, there may be valorization of materials processed by wine (Barba, Zhu, Koubaa, Sant’Ana, & Orlien, 2016; Nunes et al., 2017) .", "Bagasse has been studied as a potential source of recovery for valuable compounds such as phenolics and fiber for the development of food ingredients. Studies report that grape pomace extracts contain health -beneficial bio active compounds capable of retarding lipid oxidation during meat cooling and extending the shelf life of the processed product, as well as grape pomace flour can be used to develop a fiber rich ingredient with antioxidant properties (Beres et al., 2016). Still in this context, bagasse can be used to develop antifungal preservative for juices. (Sagdic et al., 2011).", "In addition to all the previously mentioned studies the grape pomace consists mainly of polysaccharides from plant cell walls, such as cellulos e (Beres et al., 2016 ; Minjares -Fuentes et al., 2016) . This byproduct can be used as raw material for the development of new packaging materials, to reduce the use of petrochemical products. To this end, various technologies can be applied to transform this agricultural waste into new products, adding greater economic potential to grape growing. Production of new materials derived from a plant biomass can pr ovide economic and environmental benefits to the viticulture chain.", "4.2 Natural biopolymers and their potential use in packaging", "4.2.1 Starch", "Starch is a storage polysaccharide from agricultural products found in cereals (corn, wheat, oats, sorghum and rice), tuberous roots (cassava), tubers (potato) and legumes (peas and beans) (Pelissar I, Ferreira , & Mattoso , 2019) . It has semicrystalline granules, with diameter of 1 t o 100 mm and CrI that can vary from 15% to 40%, depending on the source (Lumdubwong , 2019) . Amylose and amylopectin are the polymers that make up starch and are found in different proportions according to the raw material.", "Amylose is a linear molecule consisting mainly of linear glucose chains linked by α (1 -4) glycosidic bonds, but in some types of starch, a degree of branching can be observed (Thakur et al., 2019a) . Amylose chains are randomly organized on the surface of the starch granule in a single helical arrangement or in interaction with amylopectin by hydrogen bondi ng, where strong internal forces can occur in double helical form (Gunaratne Corke, 2016) .", "Amylopectin is responsible for starch’s semicrystallinity and is a highly branched molecule composed of linear glucose chains linked by α (1 -4) glycosidic bonds in the main chain and α (1 - 6) glycosidic bonds at branching points (Gunaratne & Corke, 2016) . The chains of this molecule are arran ged perpendicularly on the surface of the granule along the main chain, so branch points are distributed to form amorphous and crystalline lamellae (Dai, Zhang , & Cheng , 2019) . For starch to form cohesive films, degradation of the semicrystalline structure of the molecule must occur. Thus, shear, heat and forced from plasticizer addition are required so that the granules irreversibly lose the semicrysta lline structure and are converted into a continuous matrix (Shi et al., 2013 ). This process consists of three important steps: (i) granular swelling; (ii) amylopectin cluster breakdown; and (iii) amylopectin/amylose solubilization. The starch granules swel l on contact with water by absorbing the water molecules in their amorphous domains. As the temperature rises to gelatinization temperature (Tgel), the starch granules collapse. Water molecules diffuse into the granules through semicrystalline amylopectin clusters, and hydrogen bonds break down between amylose and amylopectin chains, which dissociate and are completely solubilized ( Thakur, Pristijono, Scarlett, Singh, & Vuong, 2019) . Amylose and amylopectin intertwine in a single continuous phase to form starch films ( Thakur, Pristijono, Scarlett, Singh, & Vuong, 2019) .", "Starch is a promising source for making films for use in food packaging and fruit and vegetable coatings, as it is inexpensive, renewable and biodegradable (Mali & Grossmann, 2003; Thakur et al., 2018; Gopi, Amalraj, Jude, Th omas, & Guo, 2019) . The characteristics of the films obtain ed from this biopolymer still need improvement, especially the mechanical properties and high water vapor permeability. Research has been undertaken to improve film performance by improving the formulation of filmogenic solutions by introduction of new materials. Gopi, Amalraj, Jude, Thomas & Guo, (2019) prepared starch composites incorporated with turmeric nanofibers and obtained bionanocomposites with better thermal stability and mechanical strength. The addition of turmeric nanofibers imparted antibacterial properties to these composites. Improvement i n water vapor barrier properties in starch films with CNC incorporation was demonstrated by Noshirvani et al. (2018) .", "4.2.2 Chitosan", "Chitosan is a poly saccharide produced by alkaline deacetylation of chitin, a structural polymer present in the crustaceans exoskeletons , mollusks and insects (Elsabee & Abdou, 2013; Siripatrawan & Vitchayakitti, 2016) . It is a linear and cationic polysaccharide whose chemical structure comprises two subunits of D -glucosamine and N -acetyl -D-glucosamine, linearly link ed by β (1 -4) glycosidic bonds (Elsabee & Abdou, 2013; Yuan, Chen, & Li, 2016) . Chitosan is insoluble in water, but it can be solubilized in dilute aqueous solutions of organic acids (acetic, propionic, lactic and formic acid) or minerals (nitric and hydrochloric acid). For dissolution to occur, the intra - and intermolecular hydrogen interactions of chitosan and water molecules must be disrupted. Viscous chitosan solutions are formed due to protonation of the amino group (NH3 +) located on the C -2 of the D -glucosamine repeating unit, forming a cationic polymer. At acid pH, the charge a cquired by the monomers causes electrostatic repulsion between the chitosan polymer chains, allows solvent access, and consequently polysaccharide solubilization (Elsabee & Abdou, 2013; Yuan et al., 2016; Mujtaba et al., 2019) . Due to its low toxicity, stability over time, biodegradability and relatively low cost as an industrial byproduct, the application of chitosan as food packaging and in fruit and vegetable coatings is technically attractive and feasible. Its use as a safe food additive (GRAS) has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (USFDA, 2013; Yuan et al., 2016; Souza et Chitosan -based films have good mechanical and antimicrobial properties and moderate gas permeability (CO 2 and O 2). However, its high water vapor permeability still limits its use as food packaging, since effective control of water transfer between food and the environment is a fundamental property during storage (Bourbon et al., 2011) .", "The incorporation of new materials in chitosan films is an alternative to modify these properties. Khan et al. (2014) studied the effect of incorporating different CNC concentrations in chitosan -based f ilms and verified the formation of homogeneous nanocomposites, with lower water vapor permeability and higher tensile strength compared to films without CNCs. Hamed, Ozogul & Regenstein (2016) reported that chitosan -based films and coatings have the potential to prolong shelf life due to their antimicrobial ability, in addition to maintaining nutritional compounds and ensuring consumer acceptance of various products.", "4.3. Cellulose", "Cellulose is the most abundant and available renewable polymeric resource in the world. It is found in different forms, such as lignocellulosic biomass (wood, cotton, hemp, flax, sisal and agricultural waste), marine animals (tunicates), and to a lesser extent in algae, fungi and bacteria. This material is produced at a rate of 1.5 × 1012 tons per year (Grishkewich et al., 2017) . Lignocellulosic biomass is an abundant and accessible primary natural resource in cellulose fiber, along with hemicellulose and lignin. The relative content of these compounds varies by speci es. Usually, when subjected to chemical and mechanical treatments, the fibers are extracted from the pulp to make paper. Mechanical and chemical treatments employed in the production of nanocellulose have been studied to add value to the product. (Habibi, Lucia, & Rojas, 2010; Grishkewich et al., 2017) . In 1838, the French ch emist Anselme Payen first described the cellulose present in plant tissues as a fibrous and resistant solid material. He developed a method to decompose cellulose into simple sugar (dextrose) using acid and ammonia treatment (Habibi , Lucia, & Rojas, 2010) . In 1926, Staudinger clarified the polymeric structure of cellulose (Habibi , Lucia, & Rojas, 2010) , describing it as a linear homopolysaccharide composed of β -d-glucopyranose units linked by β -1-4 bonds. The repetitive unit, known as cellobiose, consists of a glucose dimer. Each monomer has four hydroxyl groups that are linked by intra - and intermolecular hydrogen bond - type interactions. These strong bonds are responsible for the formation of elemental fibrils, the crystalline structure of cellulose, which makes it completely insoluble in water and in most organic solvents (George & Sabapathi, 2015) .", "In nature, cellulose is found as fiber assemblies that form individual cellulose chains. Morphologic ally, it is composed of elementary fibrils, which are grouped into larger units called microfibrils, which in turn are grouped into fibers (Habibi , Lucia, & Rojas, 2010) . Within the cellulose fibrils, there are domains where the chains are arranged in a highly ordered, crystalline region, interconnected by amorphous regions (Moon et al., 2011) . When the crystalline regions are cleaved, CNCs can be produced, depending on time and hydrolysis conditions.", "4.3.1 Cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs)", "Cellulose can be isolated from a wide variety of plants and animals. Different types of cellulose -derived particles have been developed, among them CNCs, which have numerous commercial applications. Particle type is primarily a function of the extraction p rocess, which includes pretreatment and disintegration or deconstruction of biomass (Moon et al., 2011) . Pretreatment of lignocellulosic biomass consists main ly of eliminating amorphous components such as lignin and hemicellulose, as well as extractives, pectin, waxes, resins and starch present in cellulose fibers. CNCs are obtained by subjecting cellulose microfibrils to an appropriate combination of mechanica l and chemical treatments (George & Sabapathi, 2015) . Acid hydrolysis is a well -known strategy for CNC production (Peng et al., 2011) ; This treatment consists of longitudinal sectioning of the cellulose microfibrils; so that hydr onium ions promote hydrolytic cleavage of glycosidic bonds in the amorphous domains, releasing individual crystallites (Figure 3). The resulting nanoparticles have dimensions and CrI that vary depending on the cellulose source and preparation procedure (Marett, Aning, & Foster 2017 ; Bondeson, Mathew, & Oksman 2006 ; Mariano, Cercená, & Soldi, 2016 ; Hsieh, 2013 ; Jiang & Hsieh 2015) .", "Figure 3 . Scheme of cellulose chain repeat unit; cellulose mic rofibrils, suggesting fiber configuration with crystalline and amorphous regions; cellulose nanocrystals after hydrolysis", "Although acid hydrolysis of cellulosic material for CNC production is well known, to obtain optimized, stable production with high CrI and high yield, it is necessary to adapt the nanoparticle preparation process. Given this factor, evaluating the variatio n of parameters such as acid used and its concentration, biomass/acid ratio, and time and temperature of hydrolysis are fundamental (Siqueira , Bras, & Dufresne , 2010) . Table 2 summarizes some examples of studies of the variables of this process.", "Table 2 . Production conditions and characteristics of CNCs obtained from different sources.

(2019) CNCs are rigid needle -shaped particles consisting of segments of the cellulose chain in an almost perfect crystalline structure, with high CrI. They have high specific resistance and h igh contact surface. Typical dimensions range from 4 –25 nm in diameter and 100 –1000 nm in ‘length. In the literature, CNCs are also called nanowhiskers, nanocrystalline cellulose, whiskers and cellulose crystallites (Azeredo , Rosa, & Mattoso , 2017) . Because they are nanometric, highly crystalline, biocompatible with natural polymers, biodegradable, nontoxic and lightweight, with large contact surface, CNCs have been evaluated as reinforcement material for a wide range of polymeric matrices to replace petrochemical based products. Recent research on CNCs highlights their different contributions to film performance and applications (Hsieh, 2013 ; Moriana, Vilaplana, & Ek , 2016; Smyth, García, Rader, Foster,", "4.3.2. Cellulose nanocrystals as reinforcement phase in films", "Nanocomposites consist of the association of materials with different properties where at least one of the added fillers is n anoscale. Their development aims to produce high -performance multifunctional composites (Siqueira , Bras, & Dufresne , 2010) .", "Polymeric nanocomposites commonly involve low nanoparticle content as filler in the polymeric matrix, which is an econom ic advantage. Thus, incorporating a sufficient amount of load to form a continuous and homogeneous structure is interesting to obtain improvements in film properties, since the high contact area of nanoparticles and properly dispersed load in the matrix ca n lead to high interfacial area in the polymeric matrix, altering the molecular mobility and the resulting thermal and mechanical properties (Deepa et al., 2016 ; Moriana, Vilaplana, & Ek 2016; Smyth, García, Rader, Foster, & Bras, 2017) . In this respect, nanoparticles, like CNCs, are considered excellent materials for the development of improved high -performance nanocomposites.", "In recent times, the idea of incorporating CNCs in food packaging systems has been gaining strength, aiming to increase the shelf life or safety of the product s in question. In addition, environmental concerns regarding petroleum -based packaging materials encourage the scientific community to seek alternative packaging materials from natural biopolymers such as starch and chitosan (Svagan, Hedenqvist, & Berglund, 2009 ; Khan et al., 2012; Noshirvani et al., 2018) . Since applications of biopolymers as packaging materials are sometimes limited because of poor mechanical proper ties and high permeability to water and oxygen, natural biopolymers have often been incorporated with CNCs to overcome disadvantages while preserving the sustainable character of the final composites (Brinchi et al., 2013; Gray et al., 2018) . Despite the advantages of CNCs as film reinforcement, phase incompatibility with some polymeric matrices such as non -water soluble polymers often occurs. Due to their polar surface, CNCs have inherent difficulty in dispersing in non -polar media, whic h leads to poor material dispersion in the matrix, in addition to the high water absorption and limitation of processing temperature, so that no degradation of CNCs occurs, restricting the type of polymeric matrix that can be associated with this type of l oad (Siqueira , Bras, & Dufresne , 2010) . Studies have described different techniques used in nanocomposite development, among them solvent evaporation and extrusion are the most used. In the first procedure, the polymeric nanocomposites are prepared by mixing the nanoparticle suspension and a polymer solution. In contrast, the extrusion method requires the preparation of nanocomposite s with lyophilized CNCs, but when dry, strong hydrogen bonds are established and aggregates are commonly obtained by limiting nanocomposite reinforcement (Siqueira , Bras, & Dufresne , 2010) . Some studies have described the effects of CNCs on mechanical properties of films. Azeredo, Miranda, Rosa, Nascimento, & de Moura (2012) , studied the incorporation of 0 to 15% CNCs in solvent -evaporated alginate films and observed an increase in tension and Young's modulus and a decrease in elongation. Gray et al. (2018) studied the ad dition of 0 to 2% CNCs in solvent -evaporated starch films and observed that the mechanical strength properties of nanocomposites were considerably improved by the CNC, but the samples prepared with 1% CNCs were superior to those with 2% CNCs. The authors a ttributed this fact to the poor dispersion of higher concentrations of CNCs in the starch matrix. Nessi et al. (2019) studied different amounts of CNCs added to glycerol plasticized thermoplastic starch to obtain extruded nanocomposites. They observed improvement in the mechanical properties of films with incorporation of up to 2.5%, but above 5%, the CNCs added weight and the reinforcing effect was reduced.", "4.4. Postharvest edible coatings", "During storage, transport and distribution, fruits suffer from loss of quality due to postharvest physiological reactions such as respiration, ripening, ethylene production and senescence. These reactions can lead to water loss, tissue softening, color cha nge and nutrient degradation, which generally depend on the physiological nature (climacteric and non - climacteric fruits), chemical composition and surface structure of fruits and vegetables. At the same time, microbial growth and reduced shelf life of the most perishable products can occur (Mali & Grossmann, 2003; Vu et al ., 2011; Thakur et al., 2018) . Although cold chain distribution is a way to minimize these reactions, this strategy alone may not be sufficient to mitigate postharvest quality losses, extend shelf life and preserve sensory characteristics. Thus, the application of fruit coating has been studied to meet market needs (Fakhouri et al., 2014; Rocha et al., 2019) .", "The coating is applied directly to the fruit and thus forms a semipermeable barrier to oxygen, carbon dioxide and water vapor, creating a modified at mosphere between the fruit and the environment (Figure 4). Control of gas exchange is established, and consequently the sensory and nutritional characteristics are preserved for a longer period (Zhao & States, 2018) (Zhao &", "Figure 4 . Illustration of the modified atmosphere created by applying edible coatings to fresh produce postharvest In climacteric fruits such as tomato, avocado, guava and persimmon, after harvest intense metabolic activity occurs, with increased CO 2 production accompanied by an autocatalytic peak of ethylene production, at room temperature, which stimulates faster ripening. Considering that O2 is required for ethylene production, the barrier formed by the coating reduces O 2 permeation to the fruit and consequently reduces ethylene production and prolongs fruit life. The application of coatings minimizes gas exchange, resulting from respiration and moisture loss due to perspiration, thus reducing the speed of maturation and se nescence due to decreased ethylene production (Ribeiro et al., 2007 ; Thakur et al., 2018; Zhao & States, 2018) . In non -climacteric fruits such as strawberry, grape, orange, lemon and melon, there is no increase in respiratory rate and ethylene production after harvest. There is a gradual decrease in respiration during ripening and a slight decline after harvest, but during storage these fruits undergo accelerated degradation. Thus, methods that maintain quality and extend the shelf life of fruits are needed. Under these conditions, the coating applied to the epidermis is able to partiall y fill the stomata and lenti cels, minimizing water transfer and gas exchange (Silva et al., The gas permeation and water loss rates are directly related to the porosity and thickness of the coating formed on the fruit epidermis. Importantly, a significant reduction in O 2 may activate anaerobic respiration pathways during storage , resulting in inc reased anaerobic metabolism such as fermentation (Miranda , 2015) . Thus , it is crucial for the thickness and homogeneity of the film to be considered when using this technology.", "The coa tings can be applied in different ways , by immersing the fruit in filmogenic solution s, spraying or dripping. The choice of the appropriate application method depends on the characteristics of the fruit in question , the physicochemical properties of the fi lmogenic solutions and the cost of the process (Valdés, Ramos, Beltrán, Jiménez, & María Carmen Garrigós, 2017 ; Zhao & States, 2018) .", "Immersing the fruit in the film -forming solution is the most commonly used method of applying fruit coating, where the product is dipped directly into the coating solution for a certain time, followed by over -removal and drying to form a thin film and homogeneous surface. Spraying the filmogenic solution on the fruits provides a thin and uniform film. It is v ery popular for firmer fruits. High pressure spray applicators are used in conjunction with air atomization systems to accelerate the drying process and improve coating uniformity on surfaces. The application by drip is performed by air emitters. Fruits circulate on rotating brushes saturated with the coating, and are evenly covered with the coating (Zhao & States, 2018) . The application of a filmogenic solution on a fruit establishes weak bonds in the epidermis (Assis & Britto 2014) . Some models propose the mec hanism of formation of the coating . The characteristics of the absorbent (fruit epidermis) and the adsorbate (compounds present in the filmogeni c solution) define the predominant mechanism type. These include: (I) hydrogen bonding , which occurs when hydrophilic surfaces or materials with high polar group density, such as hydroxyls ( -OH) and amine ( -NH2) , are predominant; (II) interaction by dispersive forces, such as van Der Waals Interactions , which establish weak and short -range interactions between molecules of the filmogenic solution and the fruit surface; (III) hydrophobic interaction, where there is affinity between hydrop hobic groups of molecules of filmogenic solutions and hydrophobic groups present on the fruit surface; and (IV) electrostatic interaction , which o ccurs when there is interaction between ionic species with opposite charges , and is considered when the polyme r in solution has a polyelectrolytic character with anionic salt groups (-COO – Na +) or cationic salt groups (-NH4 + Cl–) (Assis & Britto 2014) .", "Edible coatings such as carnauba wax, chitosan, galactomannans, proteins, shellac and starch, among others, have been shown to maintain postharvest quality of fruits and vegetables (Ribeiro, Vicente, Teixeira, & Miranda, 2007; Gol, Patel, & Rao, 2013; Martins et al., 2013; Thakur et al., 2019). The development of coatings from natural and biodegradable sources has the advantage of enhanced safety in the eyes of consumers who link healthy eating to a more natural diet. Starch is a polysaccharide available from different natural sources such as cereals, vegetables and tubers. It has shown promise as fruit and vegetable coating (Mali & Grossmann, 2003; Thakur et al., 2018) because it is biodegradable , inexpensive and renewable (Gopi et al., The addition of nanomaterials to form reinforced biopolymer nanocomposit e coatings has been the focus of several investiga tions (Rhim , Reddy, & Luo, 201 5; Ji, Liu, Li, Sun, & Xiong, 2018 ; Ji et al., 2018 ; Laureth, Moraes, França, Flauzino Neto, & Braga, 2018) . CNCs have been used as reinforcement for polymeric matrices. Well -dispersed crystals are able to improve mechanical performance as well as permeability of the coating (Azizi Samir, Alloin, Sanchez, & Dufresne, 2004; Brinchi et al., 2013; Slavutsky & Bertuzzi, 2014; Noshirvani et al., 2018; Laureth et al., 2018) .", "In Brazil, the National Health Surveillan ce Agency (ANVISA) does not deal with edible coatings through specific regulations. They are considered to be additives and must comply with the corresponding regulations for food additives (Villadiego et al., 2005; Costa, 2009) . Despite the many advantages of using nanomaterials in packaging, safety concerns from nanotechnology manufacturers and consumers are global (Sharifi et al., 2012) . Migration of nanomaterials to food is a major concern in this sector, so it is important that migration testing be performed before the product re aches the market to ensure safety (Sou za, Gottschalk, & Freitas -Silva, 2019) . In this context, the materials used in the formulation of the fruit coating solutions must be considered safe ( Costa, 2009) .", "Most of the published results show no definite concerns about the safety of nanocomposites. Little research has been conducted on the potential toxicity of these materials, as well as the environmental safety of their use. Pitkänen et al. (2010) evaluated the in vitro cytotoxic ity of nanocellulose in human and animal cell lines by 24 and 72 h exposures, and further evaluated DNA damage capacity using a bacteriological assay (Ames test). The authors did not observe any cytotoxic properties and there was no indication of DNA damage. The use of CNCs as drug carriers has been shown to be efficient (Taipina, 2012) . Andrade et al. (2015) developed an in vivo study of male rats ( Rattus norvegicus a lbinus ) fed with a diet containing 7%, 14% and 21% by weight of nanocellulose suspension obtained from peach palm. According to the authors, there were no harmful effects on animal metabolism, indicating th at CNCs product can be used as a dietary supplemen t. However, indications of dose -dependent toxicity and inflammatory effects were reported by Menas et al. (2017) in a study comparing cellulose nanofibers (CNFs), revealed more cytotoxicity and oxidative stress responses caused by CNCs. However, exposure to CNC s caused a significant inflammatory response compared to CNF s. There are few studies reporting the regulatory parameters regarding the use of nanomaterials. According to Souza et al. (2019) , implementation of regulatory definitions for nanomaterials is paramount, so that particle size is reliably measured, nanomaterials are labeled as product ingredients, and safety is analyzed by standardized toxicity and in vitro tests. At the forefront of this is the European Union and countries like Switzerland, which have specific nanomaterial standards in their food industry legislation, such as list ing of nanomaterials on labels (Amenta et al., 2015) . The National Nanotechnology Center (NANOTEC) , located in Thailand , is responsible for regulating these materials, through standards aimed at improving and monitoring the industrial quality of food prepared using nanotechnology (Amenta et al., 2015) . However, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has no regulation s for nanomaterials. Like in Brazil, there is still no spe cific regulation (Souza et al., 2019) . According to Souza et al. (2019) , in 2010 a proposal was submitted to the Brazilian Senate for implementation of listing of nanomaterials packaging of foods, medicine s and cosmetics, but this proposal was rejected and so far no other has been proposed .", "4.4.1 Use of edible strawberry coatings", "According to the Cronquist plant classification system (1988), the strawberry belongs to the Magno liophyta division (Angiospermae), Magnoliopsida class (Dicotiledoneae), Rosidae subclass, Rosales order, Rosaceae family, Fragaria L. and Fragaria x ananassa Duch species. The achenes are the true fruits, popularly known as the seed. The receptacle is the edible flesh, a juicy , flavorful and attractive ly colored pseudofruit (Holtz, 2006; Reis, Siqueira, Alves, Silva, & Lima,", "Figure 5: Structural characteristics of the strawberry According to Chitarra and Chitarra (2005) , the strawberry is a non-climacteric fruit, with gradual decrease in respiration, without endogenous ethylene production and ripening after harvest. Aspects such as appearance (color, size, shape, absence of defects), firmness, taste (soluble solids, titratable acidity and volatile compounds), nutr itional value (vitamins and minerals) and safety ( low chemical residues rate and microbial contamination) are considered in quality evaluation of strawberry fruits . However, most of these attributes undergo physicochemical and biochemical changes during th e postharvest phase. Strawberry is very perishable, has limited postharvest life and high susceptibility to pathogen development (Reis et al., 2008) . Pathogenic contamination and changes in sensory Sepal Fleshy receptacle (edible part) Achenes Pedicel characteristics such as pH, titratable acidity, total soluble solids, mass loss and softening , as well as nutritional changes , are limiting factors in marketing the fruits (Dhital et al., 2017) . The application of coatings aims to increase the postharvest life, minimize the risk of undesirable biological, physicochemical and physiological changes, control the transfer of water, gases and prevent sensory changes. Application of these semipermeable barriers has increased the shelf life of various perishable tropical fruits , such as str awberry (Vu et al., 2011) . Fakhouri et al. (2014) studied the effect of edible gelatin -based coating containing CNCs (1 g of CNC/100 g gelatin) on the quality and nutrient retention of fresh strawberries during eight days of storage, and observed that in all coated fruits, the weight loss was lower than in control fruits (without coating).", "Silva et al. (2015) reported that strawberries coated with pectin and CNCs (8 g CNC/100 g pectin) showed less mass loss than uncoated fruits during 12 days of storage under refrigeration at 10 ° C. Coated strawberries retained their firmness, but b y adding glycerol as a plasticizer in the filmogenic solution, these values decreased. According to auth ors, although glycerol is water soluble, it has a slightly oily appearance, which may have ma de the surface of strawberries oilier and less r esistant.", "According to Souza et al. (2014) , mass loss is related to water loss, since other degradable components (aromas, flavors and gaseous respiration products) are undetectable in terms of mass loss. In turn, loss of firmness can be attributed to the dehydration process associated with degradation of cell walls (Pinzon et al., 2019) .", "Rocha et al. (2019) observed lower mass loss in strawberries coated with cassava starch filmogenic solutions, but regardless of the treatment the fruits were dark er. This may be related to enzymatic and oxidative processes associated with fruit ripening during storage. Furth ermore, they observed that although the coating reduced mass loss, it was not possible to prevent pH decrease, normally associated with the fruit senescence process.", "The structure of the edible strawberry coating contributes to the positive results obtaine d regarding fruit quality attributes, since the film is a physical barrier to water loss and gas exchange and assists in preserving postharvest quality by prolonging the shelf life of fresh produce. It is interesting to maintain the structural integrity an d sensory quality of the product. In this context, in order to improve the performance of current coating methods , further studies on coating materials are required to optimize formula tions of filmogenic solutions and improve the physica l characteristics o f the films.", "CHAPTER 2 Effect of moderate electric fields in the properties of starch and chitosan films reinforced with microcrystalline cellulose", "Caroline C.S.

In this work the physicochemical properties of polysaccharide - based films (chitosan and starch) with the inc orporation of MCC and the application of moderate electric field (MEF) and ultrasonic bath (UB) as treatments, were evaluated. For each treatment, the thickness, moisture content, solubility, water vapor permeability, contact angle, mechanical properties, along with its color and opacity were determined. The surface morphologies of the films were assessed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). X -ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier -transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) were a lso performed. It was observed that the addition of different concentrations of MCC as well as the application of MEF are responsible for changes in the properties of the films, being this effect dependent on the polysaccharide used. Chitosan - based films w ere slightly yellow, transparent and presented a more homogeneous structure. The use of MEF was efficient in decreasing the permeability to water vapor in chitosan -based films without MCC, as well as in production of films with a more hydrophobic surface. The addition of MCC promoted more opaque, rigid, less flexible and less hydrophobic films. Starch -based films were whitish, with a more heterogeneous structure and the application of MEF generated more hydrophilic films with lower tensile strength and Youn g’s modulus. The films with MCC were opaquer , less flexible and less hydrophilic than the films without MCC. The composites presented good thermal properties, which increases their applicability as packaging materials. Therefore, the incorporation of MCC i nto polysaccharide -based films as well as the application of MEF can be an approach to change the properties of films.", "Keywords: cellulose; electric field; electro -heating; biopolymer; edible coating; packaging.", "1. Introduction", "Recently, the demand for products made from sustainable resources with renewable and biodegradable features has become an important part of the effort to reduce the impact of food packaging on the environment (Souza et al., 2010a) being used to reduce the amount of synthetic materials in the food chain. In this context, edible films ba sed on biopolymers, as chitosan and starch, appear as potential substitutes of petroleum -based packaging materials, because of their abundant and renewable availability, non -toxic, low cost, biodegradable and biocompatible nature (Dehnad et al., 2014 ; Shanka r & Rhim, 2016 ; Souza et al., 2009b ; Shi et al., 2013 ). However, the development of packaging materials is still a challenge (Rico, Rodríguez - Llamazares, Barral, Bouza, & Montero, 2016) .", "Studies reported that incorporation of microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) can be done as a compatible reinforcing filler for biopolymers (Ma, Chang, & Yu, 2008; Rico et al., 2016) . The incorporation of MCC in starch and chitosan -based films appears particularly interesting due to the chemical similarities in the polysaccharide structure, which can lead to a good interfacial adhesion of the matrix -cellulose, which is crucial to impro ve mechanical and barrier properties of the developed composites (Celebi & Kurt, 2015 ; Rico et al., 2016) . In this way, ensure that MCC is homogeneously dispersed within the film matrix, it is a chall enge that has been achieved by using ultrasonic technologies such as ultrasonic bath (UB) (Slavutsky & Bertuzzi , 2014) . Therefore, the search for new methodologies for the preparation of biocomposites should be addressed aiming improved film properties .", "One of the proposals is the use of electro -heating technology that is also known as moderate electric fields (MEF). It is based on the passage of electric current through a sample having an inherent electric resistance, where the electrical energy is converted directly into heat and the instantaneous heating occurs at a rate which depends on the intensity of the current passing through the materi al (Souza et al., 2010 ; Pereira, Souza, Cerquei ra, Teixeira, & Vicente, 2010) . This technology has been used in several applications in food processing as in operations of blanching, evaporation, dehydration and pasteurization (Sastry & Barach , 2000) . Recently, it gained a new interest in the food area being applied in film production of proteins and polysaccharides (Souza et al., 2010 ; Pereira et al., 2010) . There are some studies showin g significant improvement of various properties of edible films and coatings with the application of moderate electric fields (MEF) (Lei, Zhi, Xiujin, Takasuke, & Zaigui, 2007 ; García, Famá, Dufresne, Aranguren, & Goyanes, 2009 ; Souza et al., 2009 ; Pereira et al., 2010 ; Souza et al., 2010 ). Nevertheless, there are still no studies on the application of this technology in chitosan and starch filmogenic solutions with the incorporation of MCC.", "Thus, this study aimed to produce chitosan and starch -based films with incorporation of different concentrations of MCC a nd evaluate the effects of incorporation under MEF and UB treatments .

However, for the films with MEF treatment the EB values were only reduced in case of CH.MEF - 0.1 when compared to the CH.UB -C (p<0.05), while YM values rem ained unchanged. Regarding the starch -based films, the addition of MCC in both concentrations lead to a decreasing of the TS values for UB films ( p < 0.05). This pattern was different from the behavior observed for the chitosan - based films, where the appl ication of MEF treatments resulted in films with lower TS, with or without MCC. The films with MCC showed lower values of EB but with application of MEF treatment in the starch solution, the ST.MEF -C and ST.MEF -0.1 films showed higher EB values when compar ed to ST.UB -C and ST.UB -0.1 films ( p<0.05). The YM was affected by all concentrations of MCC increment in the matrix when UB treatment was applied (ST.UB -0.1 and ST.UB -0.2), decreasing the values of YM ( p<0.05).

The effect of preparation method on XRD can be investigated and no significant changes were observed in the chitosan -based films. As shown in Fig. 2b, starch films displayed a β -type with strongest reflections at about 2ϴ=17º and a few smaller reflections at about 2ϴ=14.5º , similar to that reported by Tibolla, Pelissari, & Menegalli (2014) and Li et al.

The diffraction peak about 2 ϴ=17º decrease in intensity in the other films, and the reflections at about 2ϴ=14.5º disappeared when the filmogenic starch soluti ons were treated with MEF. Thus, the application of the MEF changes the diffraction pattern in the starch, and it is not possible to visualize the peaks that are notorious in the samples treated by UB.", "Figure 2.

With the incorporation of MCC and MEF treatment was observed a low variation in this band. The addition of 0.2 % MCC increased the intensity of the bands, while a different behavior was observed for 0.1 % MCC, where the intensity of the O -H stretching vibration was similar to the chitosan - based film used as control and all the films UB. The peak approximately at 1733 cm-1 is reported to be characteristic of a carbonyl group (C=O) vibrations, present in the film matrix (Pawlak & Mucha, The FTIR spectrum of neat chitosan -based films showed the characteristic saccharide structure peaks at 1030 and 1076 cm-1 due to the C single bond O stretching and O single bond H bending, respectively (Khan et al., 2012; Celebi & Kurt, 2015) .

In general, all of the films presented a br oad band between 3500 and 3100 cm-1, attributed to the stretching of hydroxyl (OH) groups that overlaps the N -H stretching vibration in the same region. The broad band between 2800 and 3000 cm-1 is attributed to C -H stretching vibration (Cerqueira et al., 2012; Martins et al., 2012; SriBala et al., With the application of UB treatment was observed a low variation in this band with an increase of the bands intensity. The bands in the region between 1002 and 917 cm-1 observed in all spectra were assigned to C-OH deformation of starch molecules and methods related to the CH 2 group. These bands were also identified in the spectra of films with MCC . Figure 3.

Thermal analysis shows that for both polymers (CH and ST films) are present at least three thermal events. However, for samples with MCC a fourth event was observed . Small differences are observed in Peak 2 arising from MCC content in the CH - based films, with a decrease of the weight loss in films with 0.2 % of MCC (CH.UB -0.2 and CH.MEF -0.2) when compared with the others CH films. There was no difference in the thermal behavior between the treatments applied either UB or MEF.", "The thermogravimetric curves of starch films subjected to the different treatments ( Figure 6b) showed essentially the same behavior, indicating that apparently occurs a similar degradation mechanism with the temperature. In ST films containing MCC, the weight loss at peak 1 presents statistically significant differences ( p<0.05) where a decrease of the weight loss for the film with 0.2 % MCC (ST.UB -0.2 and ST.MEF -0.2) is observed (data not shown). However, these samples do not exhibit a significantly different value when compared with ST.UB -0.1 ( 5.57±0.50, 5.45±0.41 and 6.29±0.78, respectively) ( p>0.05). The difference in weight loss due to the presence of glycerol (peak 2) is also marked, where a decrease of the weight loss for the film with 0.2 % MCC (ST.UB -0.2 and ST.MEF -0.2) is observed ; nevertheless, these values are not significantly different values from the ST.UB -0.1 and ST.UB -C (p>0.05) (data not shown).

Discussion", "The studied materials are proposed for short -lived applications such as food packaging. For this reason, its behavior at temperatures close to ambient temperature is interesting. The incorporation of MCC in chitosan - based films and starch increased ( p<0.05) film thickness, results that are in agreement with published works (Shankar ; Rhim, 2016). Also, the use of MEF instead of UB treatment in starch -based films present s an effect on films thickness (higher values). Regarding chitosan -based films the type of pretreatment do es not change the values that is in agreement with Souza et al. (2010) that showed that the thickness of chitosan -based films produced with the use of electric fields (100 V cm-1 and 200 V cm-1) did not show statistical differences ( p>0.05) when compared to the untreated samples.", "It was also observed that the addition of MCC changed the MC values, being the effect dependent on the biopolymer used. The interaction between the starch molecules (0.1 % MCC) produced a greater number of sites available for binding water, so these films showed superior moist ure when compared to other starch films. The decrement of the MC content showed by of the chitosan film filled with 0.2 % of MCC can be explained by the better dispersion of the higher ST.MEF-C ST.MEF-0.1 ST.MEF-0.2 CH.MEF-C CH.MEF-0.1 CH.MEF-0.2 concentration of the particles promoted by UB treatment, thus the forma tion of hydrogen bonds between the polymers reduced the interaction between the water and the film. Some authors have reported that poor dispersion of strengthening material can lead to the formation of agglomerates of such material, even in low concentrat ion, create some prefer ential route for moisture transport , which facilitates the WVP. Shankar & Rhim (2016) showed that the incorporation of MCC in agar films resulted in increased WVP values which may be due to the bulky structure of MCC. This was als o showed in this work when MEF was applied in chitosan -based films, since only the control films showed a decrease of WVP. This in agreement with results obtained by Souza et al. (2010) that showed that WVP of chitosan -based films decreased with increasing field stren gth values of 100 V.cm-1 and 200 V.cm-1. Regarding the production of starch -based films containing MCC, application of MEF resulted in thinner films. Starch films with MCC produced under effects of MEF presented lower WVP, this result may be associated wit h smaller thickness of these films.", "The CA of the films is a good indicator of the degree of hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity of film surface. According to the Slavutsky & Bertuzzi (2014) , an increase in the contact angle indicates an in crease in film hydrophobicity. Quantitative differentiation between “hydrophobic” and “hydrophilic” surfaces is based on whether the water contact angle is θ > 90 ° or θ < 90°, respectively (Ma, Hu, Wang, & Wang, 2016) . Therefore, all samples of starch films can be considered to have hydrophilic surfaces, presenting values of contact angle below 90°, and chitosan -based films CH.MEF -C and CH.M EF-0.1 can be considered to have hydrophobic surfaces, both presenting values of contact angle above 90°; these results not being observed for other chitosan - based films. MCC is a hydrophilic material, with the presence of hydroxyl groups on their surface (Thoorens et al., 2014) . In chitosan -based films , adding MCC reduces CA values, forming more hydrophilic films. Th is might be attributed to the hydrophilic character of cellulose particles (Reddy ; Rhim, 2014b) . However, for starch films this result was different, as adding MCC made films less hydrophilic. Slavutsky & Bertuzzi (2014) observed a high increment of the hydrophobic character in starch films when they were added with cellulose nanocrystals (CNC) obtained from sugarcane bagasse; according to authors these indicate a strong interaction between starch chains and CNC with form ation of hydrogen bonds reducing the interaction between water and the film surface. In th ese cases , the differences can be related with the high crystallinity of CNC when compared with MCC that still presents a high amorphous pattern (Bondeson, Mathew, & Oksman, 2006; Li et al., 2009) .", "The CA values which lead us to conclude that the presence of MEF changes the way that the polysaccharides structure is distributed in the films. Electrical disturbance of MEF can impose reorientation of molecules was described elsewhere (Pereira et al., 2016) . In this case, these events may have reduced the exposure of hydrophi lic groups. While for chitosan it seems that MEF promotes the reorientation of molecules and reduces the exposure of hydrophilic groups in the surface, for starch films the lower CA values indicate that happens an increase of the exposure of hydrophilic gr oups toward the surface.", "SEM of the chitosan - based films showed a homogeneous and random distribution of the MCC, without pores or cracks , with few visible changes compared with the control film and the heterogeneous structure of the starch film. Most of the particles are embedded rather than pulled out from the chitosan matrix showing a strong interfacial adhesion between the fillers and matrix, as was observed by (Celebi & Kurt, 2015) . Apparently, the MCC were covered by the chitosan matrix, showing a good adhesion between both. A more homogeneous dispersion of MCC limits the formation of agglomerates of the material and promotes the cellulose -chitosan interactions needed to ensure the voltage transfer in enhancing interface polymer/matrix. It is clear that the roughness of the surface of the films increases when MCC are added to the starch -based film . This suggests that the increase of MCC concentrations modified th e surface microstructure of the starch -based films, probably due to low compatibility between MCC and starch. The application of the MEF treatment has formed starch films with more MCC in the surface, which could also explain the lower values found for CA.", "The addition of the MCC leads to an increase of b* values of both treatments in starch - based films, which indicates the intensification of the yellowness of the starch film, possibly by MCC color, similar results were obtained when MCC was incorporated into agar matrix (Shankar & Rhim, 2016) . All the films presented high values of lightness (L* > 94.09), evidencing the light color .", "The addition of MCC leads to more opaque films. The possible reason for higher opacity values in films containing microparticles is due to the fact that mean particle size is much larger than the size of the interspace in matrix film (Shi et al., 2013) and when the light passes through these films, much lower extent of light is transmitted through the film . Thus, this property could be interesting for food packaging as a barrier against light, which is one of the causes of degradation of certain foods.", "The addition of the highest MCC concentration studied (0.2 %) to chitosan -based films lead to more rigid films when compared to control films. This is explained by the incorporation of MCC that causes a reinforcement of the matrix attributed to the good filler -matrix adhesion, how was observed in SEM morphologies, which is expected to cause an efficient stress transfer from the matrix to the filler (Rico et al., 2016) . However , these films showed to become less flexible, meaning lower values of EB. Generally, the incorporation of microcrystals tends to reduce the elongation of the films (Lu, Weng, & Cao, 2005; Freire et al., 2008) . Application of MEF changed T S films only when comparing the control films. Thus, such films have higher ability to withstand tensile stress. Souza et al. (2010 ) observed an increase of TS values for chitosan -based film with MEF treatments of 100 V.cm-1 and 200 V.cm-1.", "In starch films, the incorporation of MCC decreased rigidity and resistance capacity under TS in UB films regardless of the concentration used. However, when the starch film -forming solutions were subjected to application of MEF these values were lower, po ssibly this event can be associated with poor dispersion of microcrystals between the film, as noted in SEM images. As reported in some studies, homogeneous dispersion in the matrix determines the effectiveness of the polymer reinforcing material (Azeredo et al., 2009) . The addition of MCC films decreased EB, but the application of MEF provided control films more flexible at 0.1 %, i.e. with higher values of EB.", "Chuayjuljit, Su -Uthai, Tunwattanaseree, & Charuchinda (2009) , reported that the TS of the natural rubber latex sheet reinforced with MCC was affected by poor dispersing of MCC in the matrix when the concentration was too low or too high. This sug gests that there is a concentration point for MCC for each type of polymer matrix in which it is possible to obtain a good dispersion of the reinforcing material, which reflects an improvement in mechanical strength material. The particle size is another f actor which influences the effectiveness of the reinforcing material, and the smaller particle size have a greater surface area, which enhances its ability to interact with the components of the polymeric matrix for transferring mechanical force (Eichhorn et al., 2010) . Thus, the heterogeneity of sizes of MCC observed in SEM (data not shown) may be limi ting its capa city as a reinforcing material for these films. The increase in diffraction peak at 2 ϴ=22.5 with the addition of MCC in CH and ST films suggests an increase in the crystallinity of films with MCC, consistent with other published works where this phenomenon was attributed to the crystalline nature cellulose derivatives, such as MCC (Ma, Yu, & Kennedy , 2005 ; Tibolla et al., 2014) .", "The different MCC contents (0.1 or 0.2 %) decreased the typical starch intensity peak (2ϴ=17º), similar to reported by Ma, Yu, & Kennedy (2005) , which illustrated a restrained of the retrogradation of starch when cellulose fibers were added into the matrix. The decreased intensity of peaks at around 2ϴ=17º was verified in films treated with MEF, which indicates a modification of crystalline region. This shows that, during the MEF treatment, a structure with a different X - ray diffraction patt ern was developed. Similar results were found by Han, Zeng, Yu, Zhang, & Chen (2009) when applying p ulsed electric fields (PEF). They observed a loss of crystallinity in the samples treated with 40 kV.cm- 1 showed by the decreased intensity of the peaks of the XRD spectra, indicating changes in the crystalline region.", "No significant changes were observed in the FTIR spectra of chitosan -based films, indicating that cellulose microparticles were physically incorporated into chitosan in this method. Different intensities observed among the starch films suggests that the mi croparticles of cellulose physically added to the starch caused changes in the physical structure of the film. The influence of water content and crystallinity on starch samples was studied by Van Soest, Tournois, de Wit, & Vliegenthart (1995) , that related these aspects with the 1000 cm-1 infrared band of the hydrogen bond of the C6 hydroxyl group, observing changes in the band with the addition of water. According to García et al. (2009) , such results are due to C -OH flexural vibrations which are particularly sensitive to water content and are caused by changes in hydrogen bonding attributed to variations in the molecular environment of the primary hydroxyl group in amylose resulting from changes of intramolecular hydrogen bonding. In addition, both Van Soest et al. (1995 ) and García et al. (2009) also observed that the band intensity at 1022 cm-1 increase s with decreasing crystallinity. The band reported by Van Soest et al. (1995 ) at 1022 cm-1 appears at 1012 cm-1 for all films, which shows differences between the spectra, with less intense peaks in the fil ms ST.UB -0.2, ST.MEF -0.1 and ST.MEF -0.2. In these films, reflection peaks were attributed to the stronger cellulose crystallinity (2 θ = 22.5), as observed in the samples. XRD analyzes. The peak values of thermal events for chitosan and starch -based films with MCC present four thermal events. The Peak 1 is related with the water evaporation process, a characteristic phenomenon of a polysaccharide with a hydrophilic nature; the Peak 2 (aro und 200°C) attributed to the presence of glycerol; the Peak 3 (around 280°C for the CH films and 300°C for the ST film) related to polysaccharide decomposition (Zohuriaan & Shokrolahi, 2004; Cerqueira et al., 2012; Martins et al., 2012) ; and the Peak 4 is attributed to the decomposition of the structures present in the cellulose observed in all samples with MCC, in the temperature range of 230 -370 ° C, which is the cleavage of glycoside linkages of the cellulose, leading to the formation of CO 2, H2O, alkanes, and other hydrocarbon derivatives (Elanthikkal et al., 2010) .", "The effect of MCC on thermal stability of CH and ST films was not completely evident. This is probably because the decomposition temperature of MCC occurs close to th at of chitosan and starch. However, in starch films the incorporation of 0.1 % MCC increases the thermal stability of the film, since there was an increase in the temperature of degradation and a significant decrease in weight loss ( p<0.05). This may be related to the good thermal stability of the crystalline structure for the MCC and good interaction between a reduced amount of MCC and starch. The starch control film treated with UB presented a peak of 309.53 ± 1.26 ºC with a weight loss of 58.90.17 ± 2. 20 % while starch control film treated with MEF presented a peak of 308.35 ± 0.17 ºC with a 49.58 ± 3.02 to weight loss, similar to the results obtained for other starch es (Ma et al., 2008; Rico et al., 2016). The application of MEF showed no significant e ffect on the thermal stability of the films.", "5. Conclusion", "Chitosan or starch films reinforced with microcrystalline cellulose showed to be promising materials for the development of biodegradable composites. Also, the use of MEF showed to be a useful to ol for the incorporation of MCC showing to have influence on the physical and structural properties of the films. The addition of MCC in chitosan films lead to more hydrophilic films, whereas for starch films the results showed a less hydrophilic behaviour . In this case the application of MEF was able to change this behaviour, since chitosan films with 0.1 % MCC became hydrophobic (θ>90°), while starch films were even more hydrophilic (θ<90°). The higher concentration of MCC increased the opacity of the chi tosan -based films and, in the same way, it significantly altered the mechanical properties of the films, generating more rigid films. SEM images showed morphological changes on the surface of the films, with more regular structure in chitosan films, wherea s a more heterogeneous surface was found in starch films. The application of MEF showed no significant effect on the thermal stability of the film, but the addition of 0.1 % MCC in starch films increased the thermal stability of the film significantly. In this sense the thermal properties of the films found in this study may increase their use as packaging materials in applications that high temperatures are needed.", "The application of MEF as well as the addition of MCC are promising tools for the developmen t of biodegradable chitosan or starch -based films.", "Acknowledgments The authors acknowledge Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento Pessoal de Ensino Superior (CAPES), Embrapa Agroindústria de Alimentos (EMBRAPA) and Universidade do Minho for financial support.

T he rising demand and the use in novel applications have driven the re - searchers and the industry to explore even more the use of nanocellulose.", "Currently, acid hydrolysis and physical processes are widely used for the production of CNCs from cellulosic materials (Lu & Hsieh, 2010 ; Lu & Hsieh, 2012a ; Lu & Hsieh, 20 12b; Johar , Ahmad , & Dufresne, 2012 ; Jiang & Hsieh, 2013 ; Oun & Rhim, 2015; Moriana, Vilaplana, & Ek, 2016 ).

Reddy & Rhim (2014) studied the CNC pr oduction from mulberry paper pulp by acid hydrolysis followed by ultrasound treatment , resulting in mulberry pulp CNC with stem or spherical shape with a diameter of 40 –50 nm and a length of 200 –350 nm.

(2016) also reported acid hydrolysis followed by ultrasound treatment to obtain CNC from garlic straw residues ; the CNC s obtained showed a needle -like structure with a mean diameter of 6 nm and length of 480 nm. Li, Yue, & Liu (2012) investigated the production of CNC through ultrasound treatment from microcrystalline cellulose. The use of ultraso und result ed in CNC s with a rod -shaped structure with diameters between 10 and 20 nm and lengths between 50 an d 250 nm. Despite the studies carried out involving the CNCs production from cellulose, only few studies investigated the chemical composition of the lignocellulosic material (LCM) used, as well as the purity of the cellulose used to produce the CNCs.

In fact, and according to the application (e.g. food), the toxicological assessment of nano materials is essential and should be addressed. Although several studies in the past decade have resulted in the development of CNCs with good structural properties from several sources (Jiang & Hsieh, 2013 ; Jiang & Hsieh, 2015 ; Lu & Hsieh, 2012a ; Lu & Hsieh, 2012b ; Mueller, Weder, & Foster, 2014 ; Rosa et al., 2010 ), only few works focused on the toxicity evaluation of these products .", "In this sense, this study aimed at obtaining CNCs from Pinot Noir grape pomace, evaluating of the effect of acid hydrolysis and ultrasound treatments in their structure and physicochemical properties.

The times used for acid hydrolysis were based on the literature; a maximum of 60 min was used to avoid a longer reaction time and the prolonged exposure of cellulosic materials to acid, once it could lead to the digestion of the crystalline domains of PGP and thus to a decrease in the crystallinity of CNCs (Martínez -Sanz, Lopez -Rubio, & Lagaron , 2011) .

Results and discussion", "3.1. Isolation of cellulose", "Cellulose from grape pomace was extracted through a five -step of pretreatment includ ing organic solvent extraction, acid and alkaline pretreatments, and two consecutive bleaching steps, as presented in Figure 1 (the light -yellow color of the pulp after bleaching II probably results from the remaining lignin). Each 100 g of UGP led to 10.2 g of pretreated grape pomace ( PGP), most of which consist ed of cellulose (80.1%) , being the non-cellulose components such as hemicellulose and lignin , efficiently removed from UGP (Table 1 ). Th e obtained extraction yield (≈10%) was lower than the value reported by Lu & Hsieh, (2012b) , which obtained an extraction yield of 16.4% for cellulose from grape skin using a similar extraction protocol . However, Jiang & Hsieh (2015) presented extr action yields in the same range of values obtained in this work. They used acidified NaClO 2/KOH route or alkaline NaOH/H 2O2 route to pretreat tomato peels and obtained yields of 13.1% and 11.3%, re spectively . These results show the influence of the type of residue and the extraction process used i n the extraction yield. Results presented in Table 1 show that this process satisfactorily allowed the extraction of cellulose from untreated grape pomace (UGP) for the further acid treatment, allow ing the access of the acid to the a morphous structure of cellulose , which is blocked by large amounts of hemicellulose and lignin.", "Table 1.

Cellulose nanocrystals yield", "Grape pomace cellulose (PGP containing 80.1% of cellulose) was hydrolyzed with 64 – 65 wt% sulfuric acid for 30 min (AH 30) or 60 min (AH 60) and microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) was obtained. Production of MCC from cellulose by using mineral acids, such as sulfuric acid , was also reported by Thoorens et al. (2014) . The samples ( AH 30 and AH 60) containing MCC were submitted to an ultrasound treatment ( AH 30S and AH 60S) to obtain the CNCs (see section 3.3). The CNCs yield s for AH 30S and AH 60S were 27.56% and 20.96% , respectively . These values are high er than that reported in other works. Jiang & Hsieh (2015) reported a yield of 15.7% for CNCs obtained from tomato peel cellulose , while Lu & Hsieh (2012a) reported a yield of 6.4% for CNCs from rice straw cellulose , using similar condition s. Many factors can influence the CNCs yield, such as acid concentration, reaction time, cellulose amount per acid volume used in the process (Nascimento et al., 2016) and the purity of cellulose (Xie et al., 2016) . In this case, the highest yield obtai ned in this study may be associated to the lower cellulose concentration used in this work, 0.05 g/mL, compared to 0.114 g/mL used in the other works ( Lu & Hsieh, 2012a ; Jiang & Hsieh, 2015) . The lower cellulose concentration leads to a higher effect of the acid in its amorphous parts, improving cellulose depolymerization and therefore increasing CNCs yield.", "3.3 Transmission electron microscopy analysis", "The size and morphology of the samples obtained after acid hydrolysis (AH 30 and AH 60) and further ultrasound treatment (AH 30S and AH 60S) observed by TEM suggest that acid hydrolysis provided partial depolymerization of cellulose into MCC (Figs. 2A and 2C), while ultrasound led to a disaggregation of MCC forming the cellulose nanocrystals – CNCs (Figs. 2B and 2D). The cavitation generated by ultrasound can disrupt the interactions in the cellulose matrix , essentially connected through hydrogen bonds. Thus, ultrasound makes cellulose in the liquid environment to be intensely agitated, allowing a change in its network (Chen et al., 2011) .", "Figure 2. Transmission electron microscopy of the samples obtained by acid hydrolysis of cellulose for 30 min ( AH 30) and 60 min (AH 60), followed by further ultrasound treatment ( AH 30S and AH 60S, respectively ). (A) AH 30; (B) AH 30S; (C) AH 60; and (D) AH 60S. A CB D In AH 30S and AH 60S samples needle -shape d structures were obtained, with a typical CNC morphology, as reported elsewhere (Jiang & Hsieh, 2015 ; Martins et al., 2015 ; Teixeira et al., 2011 ). The needle -shaped CNCs showed lengths of 307 nm and 32 3 nm and diameters of 8 nm and 7 nm for AH 30S and AH 60S samples, respectively, reproducing L/D ratios of 38 and 46. These result allow the ir classification as CNCs , which according to TAPPI, (2011) , must present diameter s between 3 and 10 nm and a L /D ratio higher than 5. Martínez -Sanz, Lopez -Rubio, & Lagaron (2011) reported similar L/D values for CNCs obtained from bacterial cellulose. The diameter and length of CNCs decreased for higher treatment time (from 2 h to 69 h of acid hydrolysis and further neutralization), however the L/D values of CNCs did not change. The structure and properties, particular ly the length and diameter of CNCs, depend on several factors such as the source of the original cellulose and the extraction process, which includes all pretreatments and disintegration or deconstruction pro cesses (Moon, Martini, Nairn, Simonsen, & Youngblood, 2011 ; Peng, Gardner, & Han, 2012) . Studies on morphol ogy of cellulose nanoparticles obtained from different sources have shown tendency to aggregate, presenting high L/D ratio (Chen, Liu, Chang, Cao, & Anderson, 2009 ; Costa et al., 2015) . In this study the L/D ratios obtained are considered high as suggested by Moon, Martini, Nairn, Simonsen, & Youngblood (2011) , a factor relevant for CNCs’ applicability. The performance of reinforced materials depends o n the efficiency with which the mechanical stress is transferred from an external energy source to the reinforcement phase through the matrix . In this way, the quantity and quality of the interfacial area becomes important. A high L/D ratio improves the contact surface of the material with the matrix, therefore CNCs presenting a high L/D ratio have an enhanced ability to sustain uniformly the mechanical stress on the matrix (Klemm et al., 2011) . In fact, it has been reported that cell ulose structures with different L/D ratio present different mechanical properties. One example is MCC that presents an elastic modulus in the axial direction of 25 GPa while CNCs values can go up to 105 GPa (Rusli & Eichhorn , 2008) .", "Thus, the ultrasound treatment seems to be essential to obtain adequate CNCs, and longer ultrasound treatment times may allow obtaining CNCs with high L/D ratio.", "3.4 S canning electron microscopy analysis", "The samples , initially dispersed in an aqueous medium, were freeze –dried for SEM analysis. The images obtained showed interconnected structures (Figure 3), that for MCC (AH 30 and AH 60) were densely agglomerated (Fig ures 3A and 3C). This is likely due to the strong hydrogen interactions between cellulose crystals (Peng, Gardner, & Han, 2012) . Figures 3B and 3D show the structural changes after the ultrasound treatment (AH 30S and AH 60S samples). Although ultrasound yielded a less agglomerated structure, the rapid freezing process of CNCs suspensions followed by freeze –drying still resulted in interconnected network structures . These results were also observed by Jiang & Hsieh (2015) for lyophiliz ed samples of CNC s obtained from tomato skin.", "Figure 3.

Only acid hydrolysis (MCC samples), regardless the time of treatment, was insufficient to ensure the homogeneous dispersion of the cellulose crystals in water , and precipitation was observed 7 days after treatment (Figure 4). The ultrasound treatment increased the dispersion stability and no precipitat ion was observed after 7 days of storage (CNC samples) . In fact, u ltrasound energy, transferred to cellulose chains through cavitation, gradually disintegrate d the crystalline cellulose from micron -sized particles (MCC) into nano -sized particles (CNC s) (Tischer, Sierakowski, Westfahl Jr, & Tischer, 2010 ; Chen et al., 2011) and thus increase d suspensions stability .

Peaks around 15.0 º and 22.5 º (verified in cellulose -rich PGP) indicate typical pattern of cellulose I (Jiang & Hsieh, 2015) . Comparing the diffraction patterns between both samples, it is possible to observe w ell defined and high intensity peak s in the PGP diffractogram than in the UGP diffractogram, confirming th e high cellulose amount (crystalline component) in the PGP sample, as observed in the chemical composition (Table 1).", "Table 2 presents the CrI values for all samples, showing that crystallinity increased from UGP to PGP due to the cellulose purification mainly attributed to the removal of amorphous hemicellulose and lignin , leading to the realignment of cellulose molecules (Li et al. 2009) . These CrI value s are in agreement with cellulose isolated from garlic straw (68%) (Kallel et al., 2016) , rice (61.8%) (Lu & Hsieh 2012a) , wood (73.5%) (Li & Renneckar, 2011) and cotton (65%) (Lu & Hsieh 2010) . From the CrI values, it is possible to observe t he increase in crystallinity in samples treated with acid hydrolysis (AH 30 and AH 60), which is explained by the partial depolymerization and removal of the amorphous regions of the cellulose from the PGP sample. AH30 A B CAH60 AH60 AH30 AH30S AH60S D AH30S AH60S AH60S In this process the hydronium ions penetrate into the amorphous regions of cellulose promoting the hydrolytic cleavage of glycos ide bonds, and thus release the individual crystallites. The realignment of monocrystals may occur during the aggregation to forming the CNCs, leading to the further increase of samples crystallinity (de Souza Lima and Borsali 2004 ; Li et al. 2009b) . The CrI values also increased for longer treatment times and with ultrasound treatment (AH 30S and AH 60S) samples . This indicates that the ultrasound break s the amorphous regions remaining in the samples and also reorganizes and enriches the crystalline cellulose regions. From the XRD patterns, it was also possible to conclude that, during both the chemical and the ultrasound treatment s, the crystalline struc ture of cellulose did not change , since all diffractograms presented pattern characteristic of cellulose I (results not shown) .", "Table 2.

All samples present a small weight loss in the 25 –150 ºC region, corresponding to the evaporation of the absorbed water (Khawas & Deka, 2016) . Figure 5A shows that the UGP components present an initial degradation temperature ( Tonset) around 254 ºC, due to the low decomposition temperature of hemicellulose, lignin, and pectin (Morán et al., 2008) reaching the maximum degradation temperature ( Tmax) at 346 ºC, representing the pyrolysis of cellulose. On the other hand, the PGP components showed Tonset at about 275 ºC (mainly residual lign in, Table 1), with Tmax at 347 ºC. Thus, the highest Tonset observed for PGP is associated with the removal of lignin (Alemdar & Sain, 2008 ; Chen et al., 2011) , as observed in chemical composition (Table 1) and higher CrI (Table 2) of PGP.", "AH 30 and AH 60 samples presented a Tmax of 364 ºC and 242.5 ºC, respectively (Fig ures 5B and 5C, respectively). It has been reported that the activation energy of the degradation of cellulose is significantly reduced by the introduction of sulfate groups through the hydrolysis step with sulfuric acid (Roman & Winter, 2004 ; Jiang & Hsieh, 2015 ; Xie et al., 2016) . The presence of sulfate groups is related to the increase of cellulose amount, acid concentration and time of hydrolysis (Roman & Winter, 2004) . Therefore, the lower Tmax obtained for AH 60 sample can be explained by the high amount of sulfate groups presented in this sample, due to the longer hydrolysis time used (60 min).", "Regarding the samples treated with ultrasound, AH 30S had similar TG profile to the AH 30, with the curves overlapping with Tmax at 365 °C, indicating that ultrasound treatment did not affect the thermal stability of th e sample acid hydrolyzed for 30 min (Fig ure 5B). In the samples obtained with 60 min acid hydrolysis, two main degradation events between 200 ºC and 400 °C were observed, indicating different degradation levels due to sulphate groups in the cellulose structure. Moreover, the AH 60S showed a n increas e in Tmax (298 ºC) when compared to AH 60 (Figure 5C). Two degradation events were also repo rted by Martínez -Sanz, Lopez -Rubio, & Lagaron (2011) and Silvério, Flauzino Neto, Dantas, & Pasquini (2013) in CNCs samples. According to these authors the first peak (in the degradation region) may correspond to the degradation of amorphous regions which are, therefore, more accessible and sulfated, and the second peak temperature refers to the degradation of cellulose less acces sible to acid uptake which, not being sulfated, tends to be more thermally stable.", "Results show that thermal stability of the MCC and CNC samples can be affected by the treatment conditions , suggest ing that samples obtained with 60 min of acid hydrolysis (AH 60 and AH 60S) may be limited to polymer matrices that require processing temperatures around 250 °C .", "Figure 5.

All samples exhibit ed high cell viability up to 48 h of incubation showing the biocompatibility of the produced CNCs . Few reports address the biocompatibility of CNCs (Lin & Dufresne , 2014) . Some authors reveal no cytotoxic effects. Dong, Hirani, Colacino, Lee, & Roman (2012) reported no cytotoxic effect of plant -derived CNCs for a variety of mammalian cells in the concentration range of 0 – 0.05 mg/mL, up to 48h . Other authors observed a dose - dependency cytotoxicity of CNCs . As an example, Ni et al. (2012) reported the cytotoxicity of CNCs prepared from cotton linters, presented as cellulose nanowhiskers. Low cytotoxicity was observed at low concentrations (up to 2.0 mg/mL), increasing for higher concentrations (10 mg/mL). In this work, stable dispersions were t ested (0.05 and 0.2 mg/mL) to avoid CNCs precipitation over the cells (data not shown) that may result in artefactual effects (OECD, 2016) . The increasing production of CNCs from different sources and the ir application in food has elicited ample discussion about the potential risks of these materials to human health (Seaton & Donaldson, 2005) . The same properties that make nanomaterials interesting and attractive, such as the reduced size of the particle, its diff erentiated form, and the large surface area, may on the other hand be responsible for the ir potentially toxic effects (Paschoalino , Marcone , & Jardim , 2010) .

Conclusion", "The present study demonstrated the potential of the grape pomace, an abundant agroindustrial residue, to produce cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs). A key requirement for high CNCs yield is the efficient removal of non -cellulosic components such as lignin and hemicellulose from UGP , result ing in a material with high cellulose content. This work demonstrated that the a cid hydrolysis led to the production of micro crystalline structures from the purified cellulose , and also considered the ultrasound treatment as an essential step for the CNCs production. The CNCs obtained were stable in solution over seven days, presenting high aspect ratio and crystallinity . These features are determinant for improving the dispersion capacity of these nanocrystals into food structures or polymeric matrixes , allowing their application as reinforcing materials in packaging materials or gels . The production scheme presented here to obtain CNCs from grape pomace, on one hand, can contri bute to reduce the waste management costs of the wine industry, while diversifying the source of materials for CNCs production. On the other hand, these non -toxic natural materials can provide a new opportunity for their use on food and pharmaceutical fields, and this dispersion capacity suggests possible application as reinforcing materials. Certainly, combined with advanced nanotechnologies such as electrospinning and electrospraying, CNCs -based nanocomposites can find even more applications in many fields (Li et al. 2017; Wang et al. 2017 ;", "Acknowledgments This study was supported by the Coordenacão de Aperfeiçoamento Pessoal de Ensino Superior (CAPES), Embrapa Agroindústria de Alimentos (EMBRAPA), FP7 -PEOPLE -2013 - IRSES -611493 (BiValBi – Biotechnologies to Valorise the regional food Biodiversity in Latin America) and Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology (FCT) under the scope of the strategic funding of UID/BIO/04469/2013 unit and COMPETE 2020 (POCI -01-0145 -FEDER - 006684) and BioTecNorte operation (NORTE -01-0145 -FEDER -000004) funded by the European Regional Development Fund under the scope of No rte2020 – Programa Operacional Regional do Norte.

The objective of this study was to develop composite films prepared from starch (ST), glycerol and cellulose nanocrystals ( CNCs ) derived from grape pomace. CNCs were obtained by acid hydrolysis and added to filmogenic solutions (1, 2, 5, 10 and 15g/100g of ST). The morphology of pre -treated grape pomace and purified cellulose were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and colorimetric analysis. Tra nsmission electron microscopy (TEM), crystallinity index, X -ray diffraction (XRD) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) were used to characterize CNCs. Finally, nanocomposites were characterized in relation to thickness, moisture, water solubility, water va por permeability (WPA), contact angle, mechanical tests, color, opacity, TGA, XRD and SEM . Results showed a constant CrI increase in the purified cellulose and CNCs obtained, confirming the gradual removal of amorphous non -cellulosic materials (lignin, hem icellulose and other contaminants), present in the pomace. The pretreatment process applied to fresh grape pomace to obtain cellulose presented a yield of about 12% and the acid hydrolysis yield for CNCs was 70% ± 7.06 . Adding CNCs to the ST matrix allowe d obtaining films with smaller WVP, and the addition of up to 10% formed less hydrophilic films. Films with 5 to 15% CNCs were more opaque and had improved tensile strength and Young’s modulus. In XRD analysis, the size of CNCs’ characteristic peaks significantly increased.

It is economically competitive compared to petroleum -based materials and is currently gaining the market with the manufacture of food packaging films (Gopi The use of starch -based packaging still faces obstacles because of its w ater vapor permeability and limited mechanical properties. Therefore, this biopolymer is usually added of other materials to improve those characteristics.

After ethanol treatment it was possible to observe in the samples a slight trend from red to yellow, because ºhue presented values around 20.01°. In re lation to Chroma, the low values represent less vivid color intensity; L* and a* values were lower, characterizing a darker and less reddish -purple sample when compared to the fresh sample (p < 0.05). A more accentuated darkening of the sample was observed after acid treatment, although Chroma presented a higher value that that of the previous step (p < 0.05), the value found represents a not very vivid color intensity, with ºhue similar to the previous step.

Despite the good lightness gain (37.51 in the fresh waste and 76.69 in this step), the yellowish color of the residue with ºhue of 80.85 º and b* of 20.62 , indicates the presence of residual lignin impregnating the fibers (Souza, 2014) .

Consequently, the purification process eliminated initial non -cellulosic components and the impurities of the final product. The H 2O2, used as bleaching agent, resulted in the generation of highly reactive species of superoxide radicals (O 2−), responsible for the oxidation of lignin aromatic rings and parts of hemicellulose by carboxylic acids. In this sense, bleaching removed the chro mophore groups from the raw material fiber (Sun et al., 2004 ).

After bleaching I (Fig.3E), there was partial elimination of lignin from the fiber surface, which appears more exposed evidenced by cracks. The cellulose extracted from pomace is shown in Fig.3F.

The in cellulose presented CrI of 64% and CNCs 71% . It can be said that the pretreatment steps were effective in removing a significant fraction of amorphous structures (hemicelluloses and lignin). Acid molecules diffuse more easily into cellulose amorphous regions, which are more susceptible to cleavage o f glycoside bonds than the more compacted crystalline domains (Prado & Spinacé , 2019) . Coelho et al. (2018) , confirmed the efficiency of the production of cellulose and CNCs from Pinot Noir grape pomace and similar crystallinity indices. Crystallinity is an important factor for the use of this nanomaterial in nanocomposites, because it is responsible for much of the high stiffness provided by CNCs in polymeric matrices (Marett, Aning, & Foster , 2017) .", "Figure 5.

Fresh pomace and cellulose presented similar initial thermal degradation (Tonset), however Tonset of CNCs was lower, as well as the maximum degradation temperature (T max). The smaller thermal stability of CNCs when compared to the fresh pomace was also observed by other authors, who used tomato skins (Jiang & Hsieh, 2015b) , vine shoots (El Achaby et al., 2018) and pinneaple crown waste (Prado & Spinacé , 2019) . Such authors reported that sulfate groups, from the hydrolisis with H 2SO 4.on CNC surface decrease cellulose thermal stability as result of the dehy dration reaction. In both, fresh grape pomace and cellulose samples, two decomposition peaks were observed near 160 °C and 220 °C which may be associated with the successive degradation of different lignocellulosic fractions such as hemicellulose, lignin and pectin which present low decomposition temperature.

Results are shown in Table 3. Grape pomace Cellulose Cellulose nanocrystals Grape pomace Cellulose Cellulose nanocrystalsA B Film thickness may affect properties such as water vapor and gas permeabilit y, mechanical properties and opacity. The incorporation of 5, 10 and 15% of CNCs negatively influenced thickness increase of the films (p <0.05). It is known that a greater thickness is due to a higher amount of solids present in the nanocomposites. Machado, Souza, Nunes, Pereira & Druzian (2012) produced nanocomposites with thickness of 0.15 mm by adding 0.3% CNCs from coconut fiber to cassava starch films. This value was higher than the one found in this study, probably due to the higher starch percent (6%) present in film formulation. CNC incor poration did not significantly change the moisture content and solubility of nanocomposites (p >0.05) when compared to the control film. Different results were found by Noshirvani et al. (2018) These authors reported that as CNC content increased from 3% to 20%, the solubility in water of nanocomposites of potato starch/polyvynilic alcohol/CNC decreased from 20.85% to 11.92%, respectively (p <0.05). Such fact may be associated with the hydrogen bond created between starch hydroxyl groups and CNCs, which leads to the formation of three - dimensional cellulose networks. This 3D generated network limits polymer solubility and leads to network reinforcement, wh ich restricts the movement of low -molecular weight polymers and other compounds towards water (Noshirvani et al., 2018) . Nanocomposite solubility remain ed low even with small concentrations of CNCs incorporated in the films (e.g. 12.32% in ST 1% CNCs ), i.e., due to good dispersion, even at low concentrations, the addition of CNCs was effective in promoting hydrogen bonds between polymers, able to reduce t he interaction between water and film.", "As shown in Table 3, regardless the percentage of CNCs added to the ST matrix, WVP significantly decreased (p <0.05) when compared to the control film. According to Noshirvani et al., (2018) the presence of CNC is able to increase the tortuosity of water molecules in the polymeric matrix, and therefore, reduce WVP, as confirmed by our previous XRD results of CNCs.", "ST 1% CNCs and ST 2% CNCs films presented small WVP values (4.25 and 4.55 × 10−7 g x h.m.Pa-1, respectively). When CNC percentage increased, (ST 5% CNCs, ST 10% CNCs and ST 15% CNCs films), WVP significantly increased (p <0.05), however, WVP of the film with 10% CNCs was smaller than that of films with 5% CNCs. Therefore, in those concentrations, CNC could disperse well in the ST matrix and provide a tortuosity increase of water molecules in the polymeric matrix, thus decreasing WVP.", "The improv ement of the barrier properties to moisture, of polymeric films with CNC incorporation was already demonstrated by Noshirvani et al. (2018) , Those autho rs reported that the incorporation of 3 to 15% was able to reduce WVP, however 20% of CNC in potato starch/polyvinyl alcohol/CNC nanocomposites presented agglomeration of nanostructures increasing WVP, which led to a faster diffusion of water vapor through the film. Starch is characterized as a hydrophilic polymer (Li et al., 2018) . The low value of CA indicates the high wettability capacity of a water drop on the surface of such films. Experimental results listed in Table 3 indicate that the addition of CNCs to ST matrix can significantly increase CA and therefore increase the hydrop hobicity of nanocomposites in comparison with ST control films. However, this improvement depends on the amount of CNCs: the incorporation of up to 10% CNCs to the matrix led to increased CA. This behavior corresponds to the highly crystalline, hydrophobic characteristics of CNCs when compared to starch (Cao et al., 2008a) . However, when reinforcement concentration increased to 15% of CNCs, CA value did no t differ from that of the control film, which may be attributed to possible aggregation caused by the higher CNC concentration in the matrix. Therefore, an adequate concentration of CNCs leads to the formation of strong interactions of hydrogen bonds betwe en ST and CNCs, able to increase CA and reduce WVP, as previously observed.", "Similar results were found by Slavutsky & Bertuzzi (2014) , who reported a major hydrophobicity improvement in the surface of nanocomposite films based on ST and 3% CNCs obtained from sugarcane bagasse when compared to films containing just ST. Similarly, Noshirvani et al. (2018) showed CA increase in nanocomposites when CNC content increased from 0 to 20 %.", "Table 3.

Similar behavior of the optical properties of agar films was reported by Shankar & Rhim (2016) who evidenced that the incorporation of CNCs (0 – 5%) as reinforcement material has a significant effect on the color of the films.", "Nanocomposites with low CNC concentrations (1 and 2%) were as transparent as the control but after the addition of higher amounts (5, 10 and 15% CNCs), the opacity values of the films increased, decreasing the transparency of the starch film with the increase of CNC content. According to Li et al. (2018) composite films present opacity increase due to the strong interaction between CNCs and the starch matrix, and the light dispersion of added CNCs. The low effect of CNCs on film opacity observed in the p resent study may be explained by adequate dispersion of CNCs in the starch matrix. Similar results were found by Oliveira et al. (2017) who observed significant increase of film opacity only when 10% CNC was added to agar films.", "Table 4. Apparent color and opacity of ST/CNCs composite films.

SEM micrograph of the cross -section of the control film (Figure 7a) shows a heterogeneous surface with discontinuous gaps in the matrix, which may explain its high WVP since these formed paths may facilitate the passage of water vapor, as previously rep orted. It is evident that the roughness of the cross -section of the films increases when CNCs are added to the ST based film. The smaller concentrations of CNCs added, 1 and 2% provided rough structures, although without phase separation. These results i ndicate excellent compatibility between both nanocomposite components, mainly in low amounts.

They reported that the incorporation of sulfate groups during hydrolysis results in a negatively -charged cellulose surface. From this stage, an anionic stabilization occurs through attraction/repulsion electric forces and thus, the aqueous suspension formed by CNCs becomes stable and uniform. Also, according to those authors, when the mixture of ST and CNCs occurs, followed by heating of the solution and subsequent evaporatio n in the drying of the films, CNCs may be rearranged with water evaporation. Even though the films presented smooth, transparent and uniform aspects, SEM showed that when nanoparticles were incorporated, the films presented CNC layers, evidenced by 50000x magnification. In addition, layer thickness increase was observed as CNC concentration increased (5 to 20%). Thus, those authors did not observe strong interactions between CNCs and the ST matrix .", "Cao et al.

On the other hand, induced crystallinity is caused by crystallization of amylose chains complexed with plasticizers (such as glycerol) in unique helicoidal structures, that can be induced during heating, where str ong interactions between OH groups from ST molecular chains are replaced by hydrogen bonds formed between ST and the plasticizer.", "When we observe the nanocomposites, three well -defined diffraction peaks, located at 2θ attributed to cellulose I typical structure, as observed in previous CNC analysis.

CNC incorporation was able to decrease WVP values. The contact angles with water of the nanocompo site films with up to 10% CNCs were larger than that of the control film, which makes nanocomposites more hydrophobic. Films with 5 to 15% CNCs appeared more opaque and might be applied in packaging of foods that are easily degraded when exposed to light. CNCs appeared homogenously dispersed in the starch matrix when the film surface was observed. However, in films with 5 to 15% CNCs phase separation in the cross -section was detected by SEM, which might negatively influence their mechanical properties and permeability. In general, nanocomposites did not present improved thermal stability when compared to pure starch film. The incorporation of 5 to 15% CNCs in nanocomposite films increased the tensile strength and Young’s modulus, therefore a stronger netw ork structure was possibly formed between those different concentrations of CNCs and the starch matrix.

Due to the development of pathogens (Reis et al., 2008) , the fruits are usually harvested in ripening stages (pink or ½ green ). Thus, because the fruit does not mature completely harvest (not being climacteric ), changes in sensory and nutritional quality are common problems (Pineli et al., Due to the high fruit respiration rate, soft texture, temperature sensitivity and mechanical damage, strawberries have limited postharvest shelf life, which usually lasts from one week to twelve days. Pathogenic contamination and changes in sensory charact eristics due pH, titratable acidity, total soluble solids, weight loss and firmness, as well as nutritional changes are also limiting factors in postharvest marketing (Dhital et al., 2017 ).", "Because of these factors, studies have been conducted to increase postharvest shelf life and minimize the risk of undesirable biological, physicochemical and physiological changes. Scientific studies of the use of strawberry preservation techniques have shown that the application of a transparent a nd uniform coating layer on the berry surface is generally accepted by consumers.

These can be applied by spraying or by immersing the fruits directly in the coating solution, thus forming a thin filmogenic layer on the fruit surface, which is supposed to function as a partial barrier to gas transfer (O2/CO 2) and water vapor, thus decreasing respiratory metabolism, physiological degradation and loss of fresh fruit weight , increasing the shelf life (Yousuf , Qadri, & Srivastava , The application of coatings from natural and biodegradable sources makes the produce more attractive to consumers, on environmental and safety grounds.

The starch sample contained no CNCs (ST 0% CNCs). Glycerol was added as plasticizer at a fixed concentration of 25% based on the dry weight of ST and the solution was stirred for 1 h. The solutions were heated in water bath at 70 °C for 30 minutes under stirring (400 rpm). This procedure ensured the total dissolution of ST and the formation of a homogeneous dispersion.

Results and discussion", "3.1 Fresh weight loss", "The coating acts as a membrane surrounding the fruit, which can significantly reduce moisture loss and extend shelf life (Thakur et al., 2019a) . Table 1 shows the weight loss of cv. 'Mohaven' (control) strawberries, uncoated and coated. As expected, weight loss began from day 3 of storage, with a significant difference between control (1.84%) and coated fruit (p <0.05), regardless of coating appli ed.", "The weight loss was continuous during the storage period, in which the coated fruits presented lower weight loss in relation to the control (p <0.05). However, on day 12, fruits coated with ST 15% CNCs solution had weight loss of 3.29%, similar to the control fruits, which had loss of 4.81%. These results show that up to 10% CNC concentration, the use of coatings had a beneficial effect on the strawberry packing, but above this concentration, there was no significant difference in relation to the contro l. However, regarding comparisons of weight loss between the various coated fruit groups, this difference was not significant (p> 0.05). The weight loss in the coated fruits, regardless of the type of coating applied, showed no significant difference in th e first nine days of storage (p <0.05), indicating that the semi - permeable nature of the starch coating was effective in reducing moisture and mass transfer of the fruit surface, with or without the addition of CNCs. According to Souza et al., (2014) , weight loss is linked to water loss, since other degradable components (aromas, flavors and gaseous respiration products) are undetectable in terms of weight. In this study, after the 12th day of evaluation, the strawberries presented the appearance of dehydrated fruits, since the weight loss is directly related to the water loss of these fruits.", "The CNC reinforcement was not able to form a coating on fruits with better water vapor barrier property than the pure polymer (ST). These results are not in agreement with the barrier capacity detected in the film -mounted systems, developed and characterized in preliminary works by our group, where the films with CNCs presented lower values of water vapor permeability (WVTR). This resu lt may be linked to the fact that the application as coating forms a thin polymeric layer under the fruit, unlike the film formed by casting.", "Table 1. Weight loss of the strawberries coated with starch nanocomposites and pure ST polymers.", "Treatment Storage time (days) Values represent the mean ± standard deviation. Means followed by the same letters in the column did not show a statistically significant difference by the Tukey test ( p<0.05).", "There was significant interaction between treatment factors and days e valuated. The curves presented linear model fit for all Control and ST 2% CNC coatings, while the other coatings presented quadratic model fit (Figure 2). Weight loss increased during storage in all evaluated treatments, but did not exceed 4.81% at the end of the experimental period. A weight loss above 5% is a limiting factor for the postharvest life of fruits and vegetables, so this reduces the quality for consumption, marketing and value of fresh produce (Thakur et al., 2019a) . The fresh weight loss of strawberry cv. 'Mohaven' presented in this study is within the acceptab le range mentioned in the literature.", "Similar results were found by Fakhouri et al. (2014) , who studied the effect of edible gelatin -based coating containing CNCs (1 g and CNC/100g gelatin) on the quality and nutrient retention of fresh strawbe rries during eight days of storage, and observed that in all fruits, the weight loss was lower than in the uncoated control fruits. Silva et al. (2015) , also working with strawberries, showed that fruits when coated with pectin and CNCs (8 g of CNC/100 g pectin) showed lower weight loss than uncoated fruits for twelve days of storage.

Thus, a quadratic model adjustment was performed for the factor days, indicating loss of firmness in the fruits of all treatments (Figure 3). The fruits presented initial firmness of 1.48 N and at the end of the experimental period, 1.22 N. This result is natural in plant tissue over time, because during the maturation process cellulose, hemicellulose and pectin, present in the fruit cell wall, are hydrolyzed and solubilized by the action of cellulase, polygalacturonase (PG) and pectinamethylesterase (PME), enzymes which contribute to the softening of tissues and consequently the decrease in firmness (Franco et da Silva et al. (2015) observed that strawberries when coated with pectin and CNCs (8 g CNC x 100 g-1 pectin) had greater firmness than uncoated fruits (0.25 N and 0.12 N, respectively). However, adding glycerol as a plasticizer decreased firmness values in strawberries (0.20 N). According to the authors, such results are probably related to the fact that although glycerol is water -soluble, it has a slightly oily appeara nce, which may have contributed to make the surface of strawberries slightly oily and less resistant.

In a study reported by Franco et al. ( Franco et al., 2017) , the coating of strawberries with starch filmogenic solutions did not result in better firmness when compared to uncoated fruits. Finally, Pinzon et al. (Pinzon et al., 2019) reported that the application of an edible banana/chitosan/ Aloe vera starch coating was able to decrease water vapor transfer in strawberries, delaying the degradation process. Thus, the loss of firmness can be att ributed to the dehydration process, causing degradation of cell walls.", "Figure 3. Mean of the f irmness parameters of starch coated strawberries with or without nanocomposites", "3.3 Color", "Table 2 and Figure 3 show the color properties of the uncoated and coated strawberries. Four color parameters, brightness (L *), green to red tone (a *), hue angle and chroma were taken into consideration in this study. The value of L refers to the luminous intensity of the color of a sample. The closer this value to 100, the lighter the color is, and as closer to 0 the darker. The value a* corresponds to the degree of redness . Chroma defines color intensity, assuming values close to zero for neutral colors (gray) and around 60 for vivid colors (Da Silva et al., 2011) .. The hue angle indicates color: 0° = red; 90° = yellow; 180° = green and 270° = blue ( Minolta 1998) . Regarding chromaticity, there was a significan t difference between the treatments studied on the 3rd, 6th and 12th days after harvest (Table 2). On the 3rd day, the ST 15% CNCs coating presented lower chroma value (37.50), with significant difference compared to the Control, ST and ST 2% CNCs groups ( 41.50, 40.86 and 40.88, respectively) (p <0.05). On the 6th day, the ST 5% CNCs and ST 10% CNCs coatings presented lower chroma value (47.57 and 47.14, respectively), but were only significantly different from ST coatings (52.31) (p<0.05). However, on the last evaluation day, the Control and ST 2% CNC films showed values corresponding to 36.76 and 37.76, respectively, and these were significantly different from the ST coating (43.29) (p <0.05). However, in the chromatic comparisons between the differ ent concentrations of CNCs in the coatings, this difference was not significant (p> 0.05). In general, the fruits in which the starch coating (ST) was applied showed a tendency to have higher chroma values, so it can be said that fruits coated with ST film s tended to have a more intense color during storage (Table There was significant interaction between treatment factors and storage days. However, there was no model adjustment for any treatment (Figure 4A). During storage, the fruits’ red color tended to intensify with the advancement of ripening, so the chroma value tended to increase. However, on the 6th day, the strawberries showed more intense colors. This change is probably associated with different degree of ripeness of the fruits during storage.", "Table 2.

However, on the 6th day, strawberries coated with ST 5% CNCs, ST 10% CNCs and ST 15% CNCs solutio ns presented lower pH values, probably associated with different maturation degrees among the selected fruits throughout storage. Thus, although the addition of the coating improved weight loss (Table 1), it was not able to stop the pH decrease associated with the fruit ripening process. Similar results were also observed by Rocha et al. (2019) , where strawberries, coated or not, with cassava starch filmogenic solutions, presented similar behavior regarding pH decrease during storage.", "Table 3. pH values of the strawberries coated with starch nanocomposites and pure ST polymers.

The other treatments did not present model adjustment (Figure 5B). The content of organic acids generally decreases during storage since they are intermediate products of the respiratory metabolism of fruits and are transformed into suga rs (Rosen & Kader, 1989). In addition, the pH also influences the decrease of acidity values in fruits, where at lower pH, the fruits are more acidic and consequently the lower pH can reduce the activity of the polyphenoloxidase, an ezyme responsible for vegetable browning (Rosen & Kader, 1989) In this work, strawberries showed vivid colors at the end of the experimental period and a low darkening rate.", "The treatments did not affect the quality parameters, expressed by the TSS content (p = 0.710), these parameters were not influenced by the storage period (p = 0.912), and there was no interaction between these factors (p = 0.775).

The behavior observed for this relationship was corroborated by the TA data, since the TSS values did not vary during storage. The TSS/TA ratio is an important indicator of the degree of maturit y. Generally, these values increase with maturity due to the decrease in acidity. However, this attribute may also be dependent on cultivar and climatic conditions (Pineli et al., 2011) . The TSS/ TA ratio in strawberries generally varies within a range of 7:1 for sweet fruits and 6:1 for acid flavored fruits (Franco et al., 2017 ; Wozniak et al., 1997) .

However, CNC based reinforcement was not able to form a coating on fruits with better water vapor barrier properties compared to pure polymer (ST). Likewise, potato ST coatings, with or without CNCs, did not cause changes in the physical -chemical properties of strawberries. The application of coatings does not change the red color of the fruits. Thus, color maintenance even with coating application indicates these coatings can be used without loss of the original fruit charac teristics.

Thinking on the purification of cellulose from this residue there are other technologies that need to be studied, such as hydrothermal pretreatment, aiming to re move the hemicellulose present in the material, in order to obtain a high percentage of hydrolyzed hemicellulose with the least possible degradation of the cellulosic portion. This step can be followed by oxidative bleaching to remove the remaining lignin, recovering the cellulose from the material, with less solvent and less effluent generation. Additional studies related to lignocellulosic characterization at each pretreatment stage is an interesting strategy to define how much cellulose is being recovered at each stage. From these results, it will be possible to define the best conditions for hydrothermal pretreatment and bleaching. material based on the lignocellulosic composition of the treated materials. As well as the use of liquid fractions f rom hydrothermal pretreatment, which may be rich in lignin and hemicellulose.", "Further, nanocrystals can be studied as a pickering emulsifying agent in a polymeric formulation to increase hydrophobicity without affecting the structural integrity of the matr ices. Thus, to evaluate the applicability of the obtained material. Polymeric filmogenic solutions added with essential oil stabilized by cellulose nanocrystals can be studied in order to evaluate the use as packaging film in food matrices.", "From these pers pectives, a postdoctoral project was submitted focusing on the use of agroindustrial byproducts to obtain cellulose nanocrystals, through the use of hydrothermal pretreatment of lignocellulosic material. In addition, the applicability of the material obtai ned as a stabilizer of polymeric solutions, film formation and subsequent application will be investigated.", "References", "Alemdar , A., Sain, M.

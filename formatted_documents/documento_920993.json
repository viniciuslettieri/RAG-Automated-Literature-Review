Its pulp is whitish, juicy and gelatinous, with swee t and slightly acid flavor. F ruit presents high phenolic compounds con tent, particularly an thocyanins, and can also be considered an important dietary source of nutrients. Despite its desirable sensory attributes , bioactive compounds contents and nutritional profile, fruit is highly perishable, showing restricted commercialization and consumptio n. The steam extraction is a method based on raising water vapor, which reaches the fruit, transferring heat and leaching out the pulp. Used in fruit juice processing, it is reported to produce a product with good nutrients, color and flavor retention and long -term microbial safe. So, in the present study , jabuticaba juice was produced by steam ex traction. The repro ducibility and conditions of juice production process were evaluated and juice pro ximate composition, sugar s, organic acid s and phenolic compounds profiles, antioxidant activity, microbial and sensory qualities were initially characterized. C omparison s regarding phenolic compounds contents and sensory acceptance of two jabuticaba juices , produced with and with no added sucrose , were also carried out. Furthermore , the effect of long-term storage at 25 ºC on chemical composition, microbial and sensory qualities of s team extracted jabuticaba juice , as well as the effect of accelerated storage conditions (40, 50 and 60 ºC) on chemical composition were evaluated. The kinetic parameters of cyanindin -3-O-glucos ide (C3G) and delphinidin -3-O-glucoside (D3G) degradation and gallic acid formation. Jabuticaba juice steam extraction was shown to be reproducible and 30 min was the best extraction time according to the pre -established parameters. Juice was mainly composed by water and carbohydrate. C3G was the major phenolic compound (40%) , while fructose and glucose were the main sugars (93%) and citric acid , the main organic acid (91%) . Juice was also microbial safe and sensory well - accepted.

After 112 days at 25 ºC, sugar and organic acid content s remained stable , whereas C3G and D3G were almost completely degraded. E llagic acid and total polyphenol compounds contents were reduced by half. D egradation of both anthocyanins from jabuticaba juice followed a first - order reaction while formation of gallic acid followed a zero -order reaction. Antioxidant activity values by FRAP and TEAC showed a significant decrease. Juice color suffered a great im pact, as a result of anthocyanins degradation . It remained microbiologically stable during the storage period and, witch exception of color attribute, all the others sensory attributes were not modified.

The most cultivated and consumed species is M. jaboticaba (Vert) O. Be rg, known as jabuticaba sabará (DUARTE AND PAULL, 2015; SALOMÃO et al., 2018; TEIXEIRA et al., 2011). Jabuticaba is highly appreciated due to its whitish, juicy and gelatinous pulp with sweet and slightly acid flavor. Additionally to its desirable sensory characteristics , it not only shows a valuable nutritional profile but also contains considerable c ontents of bioactive compounds, such as phenolic compounds, which show health properties mainly due to their antioxidant, anti -inflammatory, antimicrobial, an ti-mutagenic and anti -proliferative activities. Its phenolic compounds include flavonoids, like anthocyanins and flavonols, phenolic acids and tannins , and depsides as minor constituents (ALEZANDRO et al., 2013; WU , LONG, KENNELLY, Despite its rich nutritional and functional composition , jabuticaba is not extensive ly commercializ ed, being popularly consumed fresh once it posses ses a highly perishable nature, easily spoiling. Thus, the fresh fruit has been used to manufacture artisanal products like jams, vinegar s, juices and different types of alcoholic beverages such as liquor s and “wine s”, and others. Jabuticaba based -products represent a way to avoid changes in the quality of the fruit during storage and to extend its shelf life (DUARTE AND PAULL, 2015; SALOMÃO et al ., 2018; TEIXEIRA et al ., 2011, WU, LONG, KENNELLY, 2013).", "Over the last few years , consumers have been increasingly looking for healthy, natural food products, also convenient to consume , avoiding those containing artificial flavors, colors and preservatives. In order to mee t this new preference , food industry has been focusing on product development and differentiation, using innovative technologies for processing and packaging , as well as incorporating healthier ingredients. Because of that, t he global juice market has been in expansion and novel fruit drinks , with functional properties and exotic flavors, have become available (PRIYADARSHINI AND PRIYADARSHINI , 2018; VIDIGAL et al., 2011) .", "Different methods are used on f ruit juice pro duction and, usually, there is a need to apply heat treatments post -production to extend shelf life. Steam extraction has been used for small - and medium -scale red grape juice production. It is reported to inactivate enzymes and pasteurize juice during its extraction. As a rapid and low-cost method, it adds", "20 value to raw materials, being of great economic importance to small producers (BATE S, MORRIS, CRANDAL, 2001; LOPES et al., 2016).", "The development of new food products relies on the application of knowledge from different areas. Defining product specifications is just as important as evaluating it after processing and the desired storag e period. Thus, food chemistry, processing, packaging, quality assurance, as well as consumer acceptance, that is , its commercialization, show great relevance for this process. (SIRÓ et al., 2008; WINGER, 2006).", "JUSTIFICATION", "22 Given this context, the development of jabuticaba juice by steam extraction, an alternative production technique , meets consumers new demand and also contributes to the fruit valorization, while the evaluation of its chemical, microbial and sensorial stabi lity during storage is important to assure the quality of the final product. Moreover, it highlights the social -economic potential of juice production by small producers, as an important source of income.", "LITERATURE REVIEW", "24 3.1 Jabuticaba (Myrciaria spp. )", "3.1.1 General characteristics", "The j abuticaba tree belongs to the family Myrtaceae and the genus Myrciaria . Several species have been described in the literature , however, the total number of existing species is not yet well establish ed and there are controversial information concerning its classification (DUARTE AND PAULL , 2015; PEREIRA et al., 2005; SALOMÃO et al., Jabuticaba species are native to the B razilian centr al, southeast and south regions and grows naturally in subtropical climates. Although mostly cultivated in the states of Minas Gerais, Espírito San to, Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo, trees from this genus can be also found in other states of the country and in other countries, such as Paraguay and Argentina (DUARTE AND PAULL, 2015; SALOMÃO et al., 2018; TEIXEIRA et al., 2011). Among the species already related , the m ost common are M. cauliflora (Mart) O. Berg, known as jabuticaba paulista, ponhema or assú, and M. jaboticaba (Vert) O. Be rg, known as jabuticaba sabará . These two species are largely found in Brazil and, d espite the fact that both produce edible fruits with interesting characteristic s for fresh consumption or industry applicability, M. jaboticaba is the most cultivated and appreciated one (DUARTE AND PAULL, 2015; LEITE -LEGATTI et al., 2015; SALOMÃO et al., 2018; TEIXEIRA Jabuticaba trees (Figure 1 ) from different species show great variability in its characteristics, including size, ideal climatic conditions, fruiting season. In general, trees are medium sizes , branched, and their trunk has a thin outer bark. F lowers grow directly from the trunk and branches and tress normal ly flower and fruit once a year , with high productivity . Trees from M. jaboticaba specie are 6 to 9 meters tall and normally flower and fruit between the months of A ugust and N ovember (end of winter and beginning of spring) , with its peak in S eptember (DUARTE AND PAULL, 2015; SALOMÃO et al., 2018; TEIXEIRA et al., 2011; WU, LONG, KENNELLY , 2013 ).", "Figure 1 . Jabuticaba tree .", "Fruit s physical characteristics may vary according to the specie s. Therefore, the term jabuticaba refers to the edible fruit of all Myrcyaria species already described (SALOMÃO et al., 2018) . The fruit (Figure 2 ) is a globose berry, generally up to 3 centimeters in diameter and the number of seeds per fruit can range from 0 to 4. Its peel is thin, fragile and black color ed and its pulp, whitish , juicy and gelatinous, with sweet and slightly acid taste when mature . It is a non -climacteric fruit (the ri pening process do es not take place once the fruit is removed from the tree), so its harvest must be done at fruits full ripening stage, which is usually reached in 40 up to 60 days from flow ering, when the peel color becomes dark-purple or black (ALEZANDRO et al., 2013; DUARTE AND PAULL, 2015; SALOMÃO et al., 2018; TEIXEIRA et al., 2011; WU, LONG, KENNELLY , 2013).", "Figure 2. Jabuticaba fruit .", "26 3.1.2 Chemical c omposition", "Jabuticaba fruit can be considered an important dietary source of nutrients. It contains high moisture, carbohydrate and fiber contents, low lipids and proteins contents, and different c ontents of vitamins and minerals. However, varied nutritional composition values may be found in the literature. Carbohy drate is the maj or nutritional comp onent. Its fraction is mainly composed by the monosaccharides fructose and glucose, but also present s low contents of the disaccharide sucrose. Lipid and protein are found in low contents, ranging from 0.5 % to 2% and from 1 % to 5%, respe ctively. Fruit contains from 10% to 40% fiber and around 85% moisture and 3% ash. Several minerals have been quantified in jabuticaba fruit, being potassium the one found in the highest concentration (1180 mg to 700 mg/100 g dry weight basis). Other minerals such as magnesium (72 mg to 100 mg/100 g dwb) and phosphorus (75 mg to 100 mg/100 g dwb) are also found in high contents , while copper, manganese, iron, zinc, calcium, selenium, sulfur, boron and cobalt are found in lower con tents . (ALEZANDRO et a l., 2013; GURAK et al ., 2014; INADA et al., 2015; LIMA et al , 201 0). Moreover, INADA et al . (2015) have reported an iron content in jabuticaba higher than in those vegetable foods well known as iron -rich and that the fruit can be considered a source of copper and manganese. In addition to its nutr itional value, jabuticaba fruit present s relative amounts of non -nutrients compounds such as organic acids and phenolic compounds.", "Organic acids are organic compounds with acidic properties. The most common ones are carboxylic acids and its acidity is due to its carboxylic group ( -COOH). A number of different organi c acids can be found in various fruits (Figure 3), especially citric, malic and ascorbic acids . They are weak acids and exist in their acid or salt forms. Commonly present in great er contents in citrus fruits, c itric acid is also the main organic acid in berries (SOUZA et al., 2014 , MIKULIC -PETKOVSEK et al., 2012 ). In certain fruits, oxalic, succinic and/or tartaric acids can be also found, being the last one the main organic acid in grapes (FORD, 2012) . Fruit o rganic acid content is influenced by fruit maturity stage and tends to be higher in immature fruits, generally declining with ripening . Despite the already mentioned variety, most of them are usua lly found in low content . These compounds have influence on fruit’s pH and acidity and, therefore, a directly contribution to fruit’s flavor (sourness) , suitability for processing (jams , for example) and preservation . Besides naturally present in fruits, s ome of them, such as citric, malic and ascorbic acid s,", "27 are largely used by the food industry as food additives , preservatives , acidulants and flavoring agents, in beverages, reducing the pH a nd so inhibiting microorganisms growth and enhancing flavors (COULTATE , 2009; QUITMANN , FAN, CZERMAK , 2014; SCHERER et al ., 2012; WALKER AND FAMIANI , 2018) . Citric, succinic, malic, oxalic and acetic acids have already been identified in jabut icaba. According to LIMA et al. (2010), citric acid wa s the major organic acid present in the fruit, followed by succinic and malic acid s, while oxalic and acetic acids were found in low concentrations. However, JHAM et al. (2007) reported a different profile. According to the authors , only three organic acids were identified. Succinic acid was the most abundant, followed by citric acid, while malic acid was found only in trace amounts.", "Figure 3. Chemical structures of the main organic acids (Chemspider).", "Phenolic compounds are products of the secondary metabolism of plants. Synthetized by specialized cells , they aid beyond plants nutrition, being important to its survival. These compounds are involved in plants response to biotic and abiotic stress in the environment. They are responsible for plant defense, providing protection against insects, herbivores and pathogens like virus, bacteria and fungus , as well as ultraviolet solar radiation and oxidative stress. Phenolic compounds also play an important role as pigments, assisting plant pollination and fertilization by attracting pollinators and seed", "Citric acid Malic acid Ascorbic acid Oxalic acid Tartaric acid Succinic acid", "dispersers (SALTVEIT , 2018; SARKAR AND SHETTY , 2014; VERMERRIS AND NICHOLSON , 2006 ).", "Besides their impacts on plant defense r esponse, phenolic compounds show biological effects on human health, contributing to prevention and risk reduction of several chronic diseases. Their health properties are mainly related to their antioxidant , anti- inflammatory, antimicrobial, anti -mutagenic and anti -proliferative acti vities . Thus, the beneficial effects from fruit and vegetable intake, moreover its nutritional value, are linked to the presence of those compounds ( SARKAR AND SHETTY, 2014 ; SAUCEDA , 2018 ; WU, LONG, KENNELLY , 2013).", "Structurally, phenolic compounds contain an aromatic ring with one or more hydroxyl groups attached directly to it (Figure 4). This hydroxylated six-carbon benzene ring structure is the basis of all phenolic compounds . Despite the phenolic structure in common, phenolic compounds can differ significantly in chemical structure according to the number of phenol rings (or carbon atoms) and the struct ural elements bound to the rings. They may be present as simple (a single ring structure with a substitution ) or large r and complex molecules ( highly polymerized ) and also in their conjugated form with one or more sugar residues (mono, di or oligosaccharide s linked to hydroxyl groups) and organic acids (ANDRÉS -LACUEV A et al ., 2010; MANACH et al ., 2004; SALT VEIT , 2018; SARKAR AND SHETTY , 2014; SAUCEDA, 2018; VERMERRIS AND NICHOLSON ,", "Figure 4. Phenolic compounds basic structure ( VERMERRIS AND NICHOLSON, 2006 ).", "Due to their variety, phenolic compounds can be classified in different ways , based on criteria like its origin, biological function or, mor e commonly, chemical structure, which includes several classes (or groups) and subclasses . Their classification according to", "29 the chemical structure is based on th e number of phenol rings that they contain and on the structural elements that bind these rings. In this sense, there are two main groups, flavonoids and non -flavonoids (ANDRÉ S-LACUEV A et al., 2010 ; CROZIER, JAGANATH, CLIFFORD , 2006 ). Moreover, s ome authors even divide them into more classes, as flavonoids, phenol ic aci ds, stilbenes and lignans (MANACH et al. , 2004) or as flavonoids, phenolic acids, stilbenes, lignans, courmarins and tannins (SHAHID AND ZHONG , 2015) . The occurrence of phenolic compounds in foods is variable ; many classes can be widely found, yet, some of them are only pre sent in specific types of foods, for example isoflavones in legumes (especially soy beans and soy products). Flavonoids class is the most common distributed one. Additionally, n umerous phenolic compounds from different classes can be contained in a single food. Fruits, especially berries, vegetables, cereals, herbs and plant -based foods like chocol ate, fruit juices, tea, coffee and red wine are recognized important dietary sources of phenolic compounds (BELSCAK - CVITANOVIC et al ., 2018 ; LÓPEZ -NICOLÁS AND GARCÍA -CARMONA , 2010; SARKAR AND SHETTY , 2014 ).", "Jabuticaba is a fruit that presents a hig h content of phenolic compounds, which includes flavonoids, like anthocyanins and flavonols, phenolic acids and tannins , and depsides as minor constituents (WU, LONG, KENNELLY , 2013 ). The type and quantity of phenolic compounds , however, vary among the fruit fractions (peel, pulp and seed) (ALEZANDRO et al., 2013; GURAK et al ., 2014; INADA et al ., 2015) and can be also influence d by environmental /climatic factors, plant species/ variety, ripening stage , harvesting time, post -harvest management and processing and storage conditions (LÓPEZ - NICOLÁS AND GARCÍA -CARMONA , 2010; SAUCE DA, 2018).", "Flavonoids (C6-C3-C6) comprise a class of compounds with a fifteen -carbon general structure, with two phenolic rings (A and B) connected by a three -carbon chain f orming a heterocyclic ring with an oxygen atom (C), usually found glycosylated. This class c an be divided into several subclasses due to structural variations in the degree of hydr oxylation, hydrogenation and glycosylation (including the position and type of sugar moieties ) and the presence of meth yl group s. The main subclasses (Figure 5) are flavones, flavonols, flavan -3-ols (or flavanol s), isoflavones , flavanones and anthocyanidins (ANDRÉS - LACUEVA et al., 2010; BELSCAK -CVITANOVIC et al ., 2018 ; CROZIER, JAGANATH, CLIFFORD, 2006).", "Figure 5. General chemical structures of the major flavonoids subclasses ( CROZIER, JAGANATH, CLIFFORD, 2006 ).", "Anthocyanidins are natural water -soluble pigments, responsible for red, blue and purple colors of many plant tissues. Several compounds have already been identified, but only six are commonly found in the nature: cyanidin, peonidin, pelargonidin, petunidin, malvidin and delphinidin ( Figure 6), being cyanidin the most widespread. These compounds differ from each other as they may present h ydroxyl ( -OH) and/or methoxyl (O-CH 3) groups in their chemical structure. However, as highly instable and susceptible to degradation, anthocyanidins (aglycone form) are found glycosylated, known as anthocyanins. Glucose and rhamnose are the most usual sugars , but other s like rutinose, xylose, arabinose and fructose are still frequently found. The s ugar moieties may also be acylated by different organic (aliphatic) and aromatic acids . Thus, depending on the nature , the number and t he position of glycosylation and the acyl substituents, as well as the hydroxylation and methoxylation patterns , a huge variety of anthocyanins is found. (CASTAÑEDA -OVANDO et al., 2009; CROZIER , JAGANATH, CLIFFORD, 2006; HE AND GIUSTI, 2010; KHOO et al ., 2017 ; PRIOR AND WU , 2012). Two anthocya nins", "31 have been identified in jabuticaba fruit, cyanidin -3-O-glucoside (C3G) and delphinidin -3- O-glucoside (D3G) (Figure 7). Both compounds are found in high contents , being C3G the major phenolic compound in the fruit (INADA et al ., 2015, PLAZA et al ., 2016; WU et al ., 2012) . Anthocyanin content varies between fruit ripening stage s, increasing significantly through maturation (ABE , LAJOLO, GENOVESE , 2012; ALEZANDRO et al., 2013). These compounds are mostly present in the peel, being responsible for its characteristic dark-purple color (GURAK et al ., 2014; INADA et al ., 2015) .", "Figure 6.

The degree and the position of the hydroxylation and methoxylation in the aromatic ring create the variety of compounds within each group. Moreover, hydroxybenzoic acids are components of complex structures such as hydrolysable tannins (BELASCAK -CVITANOVIC et al. , 2018 ; SARKAR AND SHETTY, 2014; SHAHIDI A ND ZHONG, 2015). Three hydroxybenzoic acids, gallic, protocatechuic (or 3,4 -dihydroxibenzoic) and ellagic acids, and two hydroxycinnamic acids, m-coumaric and trans -cinnamic acids have been identified in jabuticaba fruit.

General chemical structures of phenolic acids (SHAHIDI AND ZHONG, 2015) .", "Tannins can be classified in three groups, condensed tannins, complex tannins and hydrolysable tannins. Condensed tannins are oligomers and polymers of flavan -3-ols, also known as proanthocyanidins. Complex tannins comprise compounds in which a monomer of flavan -3-ols (catechin) is linked to a hydrolysable tannin unit through a glycosidic bond. Hydr olysable tannins are highly polymerized compounds, with gallic acid ( Figure 9 ) units and hexahydroxydiphenic acid (HHDP) ( Figure 9 ) units esterified to a polyol core (mainly glucose). There are two types of hydrolysable tannins, gallotannins and ellagitann ins (Figure 10 ), depending on the acid component. Gallotannins are simpler molecules, formed by gallic acid units only, whereas ellagitannins are mostly formed by both gallic acid and hexahydroxydiphenic acid (linkage between nearby galloyl groups in the gallotannin molecule) units. The hydrolysis of gallotannins releases gallic acid molecules, while ellagic acid molecules are product from the ellagitannins hydrolysis (after a spontaneous rearrangement of hexahydroxydiphenic acid) ( Figure 10 ) (ANDRÉS - LACUEV A et al., 2010 ; CROZIER, JAGANATH, CLIFFORD, 2006; HAGERMAN, 2002; PLAZA et al ., 2016; VERMERRIS AND NICHOLSON, 2006).", "Figure 9.

PLAZA et al. (2016) found the same compounds in M. jaboticaba peel. As noted by t he authors , casuarinin and casuaricitin were the main ellagitannins among the detected ones, pedunculagin and casuariin were also found in high concentrations and pentagalloyl hexose was the only gallotannin found. Still according to them, these hydro lysable tannins, besides not being the phenolic group found in higher concentration, were the most contributors to the total antioxidant activity of M. jaboticaba . PEREIRA et al.

However, it is normally consumed fresh since it spoils easily . Fruit physical and sensory characteristics may rapidly undergo modifications during its postharvest period. At 25 ºC , its quality during storage is affected by water loss, microbial deterioration, pulp fermentation and susceptibility to mechanical injury, which cause undesirable changes in fruit appearance, texture and flavor and reduce its shelf life up to three days. Thus, i n order to avo id changes in the quality of the fruit during storage and to extend its shelf life , jabuticaba has been used to manufacture products like jams , vinegar, juices and different types of alcoholic beverages such as liquor and wine and othe rs, mostly artisanal (DUARTE AND PAULL , 2015; SALOMÃO et al., 2018; TEIXEIRA et al., 2011 , WU, LONG, KENNELLY, 2013 ).", "Owing to fruit high perishable nature, t he development of jabuticaba -based", "37 products is an alternative to prevent post harvest losses, a s well as a way to aid fruit valorization, stimulating its production and consumption.

Depending on fruit texture and type of juice desired, numerous extraction methods can be employed in order to separate the liquid part from the solid fibrous material of the fruit . In general, fruit juice e xtraction is cond ucted by mechanical processing, suc h as p ressing or squeezing (MUSHTAQ , 2018 ; TAYLOR , 201 6). In some cases, further processing, for example, preservation technologies are required to avoid microbial spoilage and biochemical changes. There are several methods applied by food industry to ensure the preservation of fruit juice products (microbial safety and enzyme deactivation). Recently, besides the conventional thermal processing, nonconventional (or alternative) non -thermal techniques have been proposed for juices. Still, thermal processing remains one of the most important and also most cost - effective treatments ( PETRUZZI et al ., 2017; TOLA AND RAMASWAMY, 2012).", "Extraction and post extraction steps are both important in the juice manufactur ing process", "39 and might interfere on juice quality (MUSHTAQ , 2018 ).", "Fruit juice m echanical production relies on the application of two types of forces, compression and attrition , in solo or combined ways (FELLOWS , 2017) .

Pressers and pulpers are common equipment found in food industry (FELLOWS, 2017; MUSHTAQ , 2018 ; TAYLOR, 2016) .", "The ste am extraction is an alternative method to the mechanical ones. It is conducted by the raising water vapor, which reaches the fruit, transferring heat and leaching out the pulp. This method is reported to ina ctivate enzymes and pasteurize without drastically compromising juice nutritional profile, producing a juice with good color and flavor retention and also provid ing a long -term microbial safety, w ithout requiring any further pre servation technology to be applied. It is a simple and low -cost method, with short time performance , widely used in small - and medium -scale juice production, especially for red grape juice (BATES, MORRIS, CRANDAL, 2001 ; LOPES et al., 2016 ). A steam extractor , or steam juicer (Figure 12), is composed of three pieces, a water pan, a juice -collecting container and a fruit container , arranged one above the ot her. The bottom piece is the water pan, placed on a heat source in order to boil the water and, thus, produce the steam for the process. The juice -collecting container has a central conical opening in its bottom, which allows the passage of the steam , and an outlet with a drain, through which the juice is bottled. At the end of the drain there is a clamp, which helps the juice packaging. The top piece , the fruit container , is a basket (and a lid) , which the bottom and s ide surfaces have perforations, allowing the steam to reach the fruit and the juice to be collected, while keeping the fruit out of the extracted juice (ANJOS , 1999) .", "Figure 12. Illustrative scheme of a juice steam extractor (Source: www.bestofjuicer.com/best -steam -juicer ).", "As preservation technologies, conventional t hermal methods are based on the application of heat in order to eliminate pathogenic microorganism , reduce or eliminate undesired spoilage microorganism s and inactivate enzymes, promoting safety and quality to foods during storage (AGÇAM, AKYILDIZ, DÜNDAR, 2018 ; NGADI, BAJWA, ALAKALI, 2012) .

To date, pasteurization is the most commonly thermal method used by food industry in the processing of juice s and beverages . It is a mild heat trea tment, with heating temperatures usuall y below 100 ºC, and includes, specially, both low - temperature long -time (LTLT) and high -temperature short -time (HTST) techniques. LTLT comprises temperatures around 65 ºC for no less than 30 minutes while HTST, temperatures at 75ºC or above, with the duration time ranging from 15 up to 30 seconds (CHEN, YU, RUPRASINGHE, 2013; FELLOWS, 2017; ORTEGA -RIVAS AND SALMERÓN -OCHOA, 2014 ).", "41 Among the non-thermal preservation technologies, high hyd rostatic pressure (HHP), pulsed electric field, ultrasound, short -wave UV light and pulsed light are the mainly innovative approaches to obtain fruit products with extended shelf life without heat application (GÓMEZ , WELTI -CHANES, ALZA MORA, 2011; ORTEGA -RIVAS AND SALMERÓN -OCHOA, 2014; TOLA AND RAMASWAMY, 2012). HHP consists of subjecting the food to elevated pressures , which is homogeneously and instantaneously distributed throughout the product , resulting in microbial inactivation and enzymatic activity reduction (AUGUSTO et al ., 2018; ORTEGA -RIVAS AND SALMERÓN - OCHOA, 2014 ; TOLA AND RAMASWAMY, 2012 ). Pulsed electric field technology is based on the application of an externally generated electric field with high voltage pulses for short periods of time across the food product , resulting in microbial inactivation (KOUBAA et al., 2018). Ultrasound technology involves the application of sound waves with high power and low frequencies . The high energy generated by sound leads to the formation of cavities, what causes the disruption of cellular structures (SWAMY , MUTHUKUMARAPPAN, ASOKAPANDIAN 2018 ). The use UV light in food processing for preservation of fruit juices is related to the short -length UV light, or UV -C light. The s hort-wave UV light radiation is absorbed by different cellular components , especially by the DNA . The absorbed UV light , thus, damages the microbial DNA by promoting the formation of products that inhibit DNA transcription and re plication, what results in cell death. The microorganism becomes unable to proliferate and so inactive, reducing the microbial load (BAYSAL, 2018; GÓMEZ, WELTI -CHANES, ALZAMORA, 2011) . Pulsed light involves the use of intense and short duration pulses of light of a broad spectrum of wavelength, ranging from the u ltraviolet to the near infrared region . Its mode of action is responsible for the microorganism inactivation and, consequently, food produc t preservation is the same as the short -wave UV light radiation (GÓMEZ , WELTI - CHANES, ALZAMORA, 2011). Despite the great variety of non -thermal preservation technologies, those are high costly and thus not frequently used (GÓMEZ, WELTI - CHANES, ALZAMORA, 2011; ORTEGA -RIVAS AND SALMERÓN -OCHOA, 2014; TOLA AND RAMASWAMY, 2012).", "42 3.3 Food p roduct development", "Developing new food products is a complex process.

For this purpose, juice ’s production yield , pH, TSS, color and anthocyanin content were chosen to evaluate the reproducibility of the process of production of steam extracted jabuticaba juice. SST and pH are characteristics related to product taste and also used to define identity and quality standard s by Brazilian legislation , while color is a sensory attribute linked to consumer perception of the product. Anthocyanin s were chosen as these compounds are major bioactive s presented in the juice and al so directly impact on product color.

Therefore, s afety and", "69 quality are the two main aspects considered (MAN, 2016). It is known that food products characteristics change over time as chemical reactions and microbial growth occur during storage. This may negatively impact food products nutritional value, color, appearance, texture, flavor and bioactive compounds profile and, consequently, consumers acceptability. In this sense, monitoring food products stability and identifyi ng which and how factors affect it can help controlling its quality during storage and estimating its shelf life. Stability studies can be done through experimental storage tests under conditions that simulate those typically found during food products sto rage, distribution and commercialization, with periodical measurements of quality attributes and the use of kinetic modeling (A MODIO , DEROSSI, COLELLI, 2014 ; KONG AND SINGH, 2016 ; Kinetic modeling is an important tool for understand ing, predict ing and control ling the influence of thermal processing and storage on food quality loss. Based on changes in concentrations over time, it is possible to measure how quickly reactions occur and if they are affected by modifications in their condition s. Data is normally obtained experimentally, by monitoring the consumption of a reactant or the formation of a product. Through mathematical models of thermodynamics and chemical kinetics, it is possible to acquire knowledge on kinetics parameters such as reaction order, rate constant and activation energy and on the mechanisms of rea ctions, as well as to estimate and minimize possible undesirable changes in foods. The Arrhenius equation is the most common relationship used to describe the effect of temperature on chemical reactions , exploring its dependence. Kinetic models in food pro cessing are usually applied to describe, for example, color changes (such as enzymatic and non -enzymatic browning and thermal destruction of pigments), degradation of nutrients and bioactive compounds, formation of undesirable compounds, inactivation of en zymes, microbial growth (LING et al, 2015; PATRAS et al., The present study evaluated the stability of steam extracted jabuticaba juice WNAS stored at 25 ºC for 112 days ( chemical ) and 168 days (microbial and sensory ), in order to simulate juice storage, distribution and commercialization conditions .

The slight decrease in sucrose content observed at the end of storage period can be possible explained by its chemical hydrolysis to fructose and glucose, the two monosaccharides forming this molecule, catalyzed by the characteristic acidity of the juice. How ever, no significant increase on fructose or glucose contents was observed, suggesting that the amount of these sugars yielded by the hydrolysis may not have been sufficient to lead to a statistically significant increase in their contents. The stability of sugar s is related to their chemistry characteristics. Fructose and glucose show a good stability in acid aqueous solutions, whereas sucrose is more stable in alkaline solutions, being susceptible to hydrolysis at acid pH (CLARKE , EDYE, EGGLESTON, 1997). SANDI et al.

Still, this was not a relevant difference, as tartaric acid is one of the minor organic acids found in the juice. Among the four organic acid s identified, citric acid, as the predominant one, is the one which probably contribut es the most to juice flavor characteristics. Changes in cit ric acid contents during storage would be much more worrisome. According to FÜGEL, CARLE, SCHIEBER (2005), organic acids exhibit low susceptibility to changes during processing and storage, especially if compared to other compounds, such as pigments. This is because their decomposition, resulted from decarboxylation and dehydration reactions, requires h eating (CHU AND CLYDESDALE, 1976 ).

Several factors affect their stability, accelerating their degradation, such as high pH, high temperature, low concentration, specific chemical structure, light, oxygen, enzymes, sugars, ascorbic acid, metallic ions, among others (CASTAÑEDA -OVANDO et al., 2009; CAVALCANTI, SANTOS, MEIRELES, 2011; PATRAS et al., 2010). Considering this, the expressive decrease in D3G and C3G contents (Table 8) in t he present study was, somehow, expected. A similar decrease was reported by INADA et al. (2018b) during the storage of jabuticaba juice at 25 ºC for 90 days. Other previous studies have demonstrated the thermal instability of anthocyanins. S UI et al. (2016 ) showed that their chemical stability on aqueous solutions directly depends on the storage temperature. According to the authors, solutions stored at 4 ºC showed substantial lower losses than those stored at 25 ºC, 45 ºC and 65 ºC. HELLSTRÖM et al. (2013) and MÄKILÄ et al. (2016) evaluated the anthocyanin content of commercial berry juices stored at 21 ºC for 12 weeks and of blackcurrant juice at 25 ºC for 12 months, respectively. Both studies showed significant reductions on anthocyanins contents, which were attenuated when juices were stored at 4 ºC. In addition, HELLSTRÖM et al.

The effect of temperature on the stability of each anthocyanin was investigated. Concentrations of D3G and C3G of jabuticaba juices WNAS stored at 25 ºC, 40 ºC, 50 ºC and 60 ºC decreased over time, at all temperatures, although more rapidly at higher ones (Figure 1 9). D3G and C3G were almost completely degraded after 112 days at 25 ºC , while at 60 ºC, similar losses were already observed after 7 days. Similarly, SUI et al (2016) have demonstrated that C3G was instable in aqueous solution s, being degraded a t higher rates at 65 ºC, leading to a complete loss after six days .", "Storage time (days)D3G content (mg/100 mL) Storage time (days)C3G content(mg/100 mL)", "Figure 1 9.

Apparently, D3G was degraded as fast as C3G. Plots of logarithmically transformed concentrations of both anthocyanins at each temperature against time resulted in straight lines, showing good fitting ( R2>0.96; Table 9). First -order reactions are frequently reported in foods , in particular anthocyanins degradation , and indicate that the degradation rate is dependent and proportional to the reagent concentration, sh owing an exponential behavior ( BOEKEL, 2008 ; HELLSTRÖM et al., 2 013; PATRAS et al., 2010; PERON , FRAGA, ANTELO, 2017; SINELA et al., 2017).

It is the minimum amount of energy that is required so the compounds are able to react and is determined fro m experimental rate constants ( BOEKEL, 2008). A reaction with higher E a is more sensitive to temperatu re, what means that substrates in reactions with higher E a tend to be degraded by minor changes in the temperature (HOU et al., 2013). Experimental Ea values are presented in Table 9. The v alue for D3G (70.10 kJ/mol) was slightly lower than for C3G (73.38 kJ/mol), suggesting that the former anthocyanin would be less stable than the latter. It is known that degradation rates vary among anthocyanins due to differences in their chemical structure. Generally, the number and the position of hydroxyl and methoxyl groups in the aglycone affect anthocyanins chemical behavior. An increase in hydroxylation decreases their stability while an increase in methoxylation increases their stability (CASTAÑEDA - OVANDO et al., 2009; CAVALCANTI, SANTOS, MEIRELES, 2011). In this sense, since D3G and C3G contain two and one hydroxyl groups, respectively, it would be expected a higher stability of the latter . In fact, SINELA et al. (2017) evaluated the stability of delphinidin -3-O-sambubioside (D3S) and cyanidin -3-O-sambubioside (C3 S) from hibiscus extract and demonstrated that D3S tended to be significantly more sensitive to an increase in temperature than C3S. Despite the difference on the nature of glycosylation, both studies evaluated comparatively the degradation of anthocyanins with", "78 the same aglycone moieties, as well as the same position of glycosylation. Beyond anthocyanins contribution to phenolic compounds content of plants, these compounds are natural pigments responsible for the pink, red, violet and blue colors and its hues of fruits, flowers, leaves and some vegetables (CASTAÑEDA -OVANDO et al., 2009; CAVALCANTI, SANTOS, MEIRELES, 2011) . Once they are readily degrade d, especially during processing and storage of food products, color measurement is important to evaluate fo od products quality, what can be conducted by visual inspection, trained inspectors using special vocabulary to give the color description, or instruments, such as colorimeters and spectrophotometers. Instrumental measurements have been used in the food in dustry and provide quantitative measurement, in a more objective way, by simulating the human perception of color under particular conditions as illumination and observer angle, wit h the use of color indices ( or spaces) (WU AND SUN, 2013). Color spaces, although not providing a precise color definition, are useful for evaluat ing color differences and changes during process ing and storage (WROLSTAD , DURST, LEE, 2005). CIELab is the most used color space (WU AND SUN, 2013), in whi ch color is numerically expressed by L*, a* and b* values, lightness and chromaticity coordinates, green –red and blue –yellow color components, respectively. Difference between colors can be described by ΔE values, comprising the total color difference (OBÓ N, CASTELLAR, After 112 days of storage, steam extracted jabuticaba juice WNAS lightness values increased around 3%, while green –red and blue –yellow color components values decreased around 67% and 55%, respectively ( Table 1 0). These results indicate that the juice became slightly darker, substantially less reddish and more bluish, losing its characteristic purple coloration. Similar results were described by INADA et al.

The increase in gallic acid contents may have been a result of the thermal degradation of delphinidin, as well as the thermal hydrolysis of gallotannins. Gallic acid is known as a degradation product of delphinidin, which, in its turn, is a compound that prese nt low thermal stability (SINELA et al., 2017). Also, gallic acid can be released by the hydrolysis of ga llotannins during heating (GONZÁLEZ, TORRES, MEDINA, 2010; TERÁN -HILARES et al., 2017).

On the other hand, considerable amounts of gallotannins have already been described in jabuticaba fruit (PLAZA et al., 2016). Formation of gallic acid in jabuticaba juices followed a zero -order kinetic model , meaning that it was in dependent of the reagent concentration . Therefore, zero-order reactions are norm ally related to reactions in which the amount of product formed is much small er than the amount of the precursors present (BOEKEL, 2008). Rates constants (k) values increased by 24 -fold between the lowest (0 .0126 mg/100 mL. day) and the highest temperatures (0.3033 mg/100 mL. day), indicating that the storage temperature had a strong influence on gallic acid formation.

The divergent behavior of antioxidant activity evaluated by Folin -Ciocalteu, FRAP and TEAC may have resulted from the different mechanisms of each assay . There are two main ways by which antioxidant compounds deactivate free radicals: hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) and single electron transfer (SET). These mechanisms can occur indiv idually or simultaneously, depending on the antioxidant structure and properties, yet, HAT and SET almost always occur together in foods. Because of that, assays for the determination of antioxidant activity can be HAT -based, SET -based or even based on bot h HAT and SET mechanisms. FRAP assay works via SET mechanisms, while TEAC and Folin -Ciocalteu assays via both HAT and SET mechanisms (PRIOR et al., 2005). In addition, differences in Folin -Ciocalteu values in comparison to FRAP and TEAC values, could also be explained by the lack of specificity of the former assay (SÁNCHEZ - RANGEL et al., 2013). Its response may have suffered interference from non -phenolic compounds, leading to a possible overestimated evaluation.", "Total phenolic compounds content showed a substantial decrease after 112 days, as already mentioned, mainly driven by the reduction in D3G, C3G and ellagic acid contents. Changes in antioxidant activity values by FRAP, TEAC and Folin -Ciocalteu, however, were not proportional to this decr ease. Additionally, apart from the comparison between day 0 and day 112, antioxidant activity values over the storage period showed an unstable behavior, independently of the methods for the determination of antioxidant activity employed, although, results of each method have shown a specific fluctuation ( Figure 2 7). The modifications observed in total phenolic compounds content did not follow what happened to antioxidant activity throughout this same period. These results indicate that both total phenolic compounds content and their types account to antioxidant activity response. Seeing that, they could not be explained just based on the total phenolic compounds c ontent. As stated by RICE -EVANS, MILLER, PAGANGA (1996), there is a relationship between phenol ic compounds chemical structure and their antioxidant activity, that is, each compound has a specific antioxidant activity. The phenolic compounds content had a less expressive impact on juice antioxidant activity than the change in its profile. Indeed, PL AZA et al. (2016) observed that C3G, despite being the phenolic compound in greater concentration in jabubitaca peel, was not the major contributor to its antioxidant activity, whereas ellagitannins and gallotannins, although found in lower concentrations, were the class with higher contribution. Furthermore, it is also important to highlight that jabuticaba juice is a complex", "Storage time (days)mmol Fe2+/100 mL Storage time (days)mmol Trolox/100 mL Storage time (days)mg GAE/100 mLmatrix, containing several phenolic compounds non -identified in the present study that coul d have been degraded or formed during the storage, which could have also contributed to these antioxidant activity results.", "Figure 2 7.

Due to it, this kind of product is very liable to be spoiled by microorganism, rapidly fermenting. Thus, its preservation, especially in long -term storage, is challenging and requires careful processing, packaging and storage. After properly produced, fruit juices are, in most cases, subjected to preservation techniques to prevent its microbial deterioration and, sometimes, also added of chemical preservatives or maintained under refrigeration (ASHURST et al., 2017; MUSHTA Q, 2018 ; RAJAURIA AND TIWARI, 2018). In view of this, a periodic monitoring of microbial quality of juice WNAS was carried out ( Table 11). Juice remained microbiologically stable for 168 days at 25 ºC and low numbers of microorganisms were detected during its storage. These results show that the steam extraction followed by hot - filling technique was able to minimize microbial spoilage of the f inal product, extending its shelf -life without requiring neither the employment of any preservation technology associated nor the addition of chemical preservatives. According to ASHURST et al., 2017, most soft drinks are not completely sterile and may con tain very low levels of microorganisms, what do not pose a risk to the shelf life of the product, and, if product is properly pasteurized, there will be no microbiological deterioration during storage. Moreover, these results also suggest that the juice pr esents unfavorable conditions for the growth of microorganisms, such as its low pH.", "Table 11.

The only attribute that differed significantly was color, which showed lower score. This was, in some way, expected as anthocyanins, compounds responsible for the juice color, were extensively degraded during the storage. However, the difference between means was not so large, corresponding to around 4%, and also much less pronounced than total color difference (instrumental). The purchase intent scores ( Table 1 2) were also equivalent, both corresponding to “maybe would buy, maybe would not buy” at the five -point scale. Therefore, juice sensory characteristics were preserved and probably will not impai r on consumers product acceptance in a commercial scale, although color is an important sensory characteristic since it is seen by consumers as a quality indicator. Furthermore, these results suggest that steam extraction was effective in inactivating enzymes naturally present in the fruit, which could have led to physico -chemical changes in the juice during the storage, negatively impacting on its sensory quality.", "The addition of sucrose did not interfere neither positively nor negatively on juice sensor y stability. Similarly to juice WNAS , all sensory attributes, except for color, and purchase intent scores of juice WAS did not show significant differences at the end of the storage period at 25 ºC (Table 1 2).", "91 Table 12 .

Overall, t he method not only provided a product with acceptable variability of quality aspects , but also with good nutritional , functional and sensorial characteristics . The addition of sucrose improved juice sensory acceptance, contributing to a flavor more appreciated by consumers, while preserving the functional characteristic of the juice. Sugars and organic acids , which contribute to fruit juice sensory characteristics, remained constant d uring 112 days. These results relate to the unaffected taste in the sensorial analysis of juices stored for 168 days . Additionally, organic acids stability was also important to juice microbiological quality , contributing to unfavorable conditions for the growth of microorganisms during the whole storage period.", "Despite the almost complete degradation of anthocyanins in the juice and the relevant reduction in ellagic acid and total phenolic compounds contents during storage at 25 ºC , juice still presented, at the end of this period, considerable total phenolic compounds content and antioxidant activity values. Storage experiments at different temperatures provided some insights on the degradation/formation of the main phenolic compounds of steam extracted jabuticaba juice during its storage, such as degradation of anthocyanins and formation of gallic and ellagic acids. In this context, strategies to improve phenolic compounds stability , such as addition of natural conservatives and cold storage, would be of great importan ce. In summary, steam ext racted jabuticaba juice has a potential of commercialization and also represents a way to ai d fruit valorization, allowing fruit consumption expansion with regard to fruit harvest period and cultivation place.", "94 REFERENCES", "ABE, L.

Psychic Income of Mega -Events: A Study about the Summer Olympics . Rio de Janeiro, 2019. Master Dissertation in Business Administration – COPPEAD Graduate School of Business, The Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, 2017. From the literature on mega -events, one might observe that the financial bottom line for hosting a mega -event is not always positive. However, they are still very popular. Then, it is relevant to investigate and analyze the other reasons that make hosting a mega -event worthwhile, if there are any, and the intangible objectives it is hoped to achieve from them. The main theoretical background of the research is the Psychic Income paradigm, developed by Crompton (2004) and operationalized by Kim and Walker (2012) , to try and justify public financing of sports arenas from the perspective of the intangible benefits people from the community receive from them. The research objectives were broken down into seven substantive hypotheses that reflected each psychic in come dimension. A survey was conducted with people native from Rio de Janeiro. Two samples were collected for the present study: one five months before, with 333 respondents, and one another one month after the Olympics, with 1025 respondents. Overall, there were 1 358 observations. Some adaptations to the survey were necessary to ensure the scale’s application in a Brazilian context . For this purpose, some items were reformulated to try and capture what the construct aimed at expressing and adapt it to the Brazilian context and the mega -event in question. In this case, the 2016 Rio Summer Olympics. Data analysis was conducted using a single database, made of both samples. To accomplish this task, it was used a Difference of Means Test (Two sample T -Test), an Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) and a Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA), verifying reliability, convergent validity and discriminant validity. In order to test the hypotheses, Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) was used with the Maximum Likelihood (ML) technique. As a result, the seven research hypotheses were supported. The results suggest there is a positive relationship between hosting a mega -event and the psychic income reflexes. In addition, the results suggest that the scale is adequate to measure both the expectations prior to the event and the perception of people afterwards.", "Keywords: psychic income, social i mpacts, mega -events, Olympic Games, Rio 2016.", "LIST OF FIGURES Figure 1 .

Two years later, Rio de Janeiro was confirmed as the host city for the 2016 Summer Olympic Games (Olympic Movement, 2009) . Moreover, every year, there is a mega -event in Brazil: Carnival, which receives high investments (USA Today, 2018; The Atlantic, 2019) . There are also music festivals, such as Rock in Rio (G1, 2017; G1, 2018) and Lollapalooza (G1, 2018) , which are getting more popular with each edition. In order to support the execution of a mega -event, high investments are in order. For instance, for the Olympic Games, the host city will need both private and public investments to build new arenas for the competitions, improve its transportation network, communications, hotel network, strengthen security and crime prevention, with costs in the order of billions of dollars (Riley, 2012) , that not always return in the form of revenues. In the 2010 Vancouver Winter Olympics, even though Canada had a record of 14 gold medals, the event ended with billions of dollars in deficits, in part due to the government taking over the construction of the Olympic Village after the company responsible was unable to do so because of a credit crisis (CNBC, 2012) . The Canadians were n ot very happy with the project , since funds of public services such as education, health and arts financing that were diverted to infrastructure -building for the event (CNBC, 2012) .", "Similarly, in the 2004 Athens Summer Olympic Games, the estimated budget of US$4.6 billion reached around US$14 billion, a situation that most likely contributed to the financial crisis that struck the country (CNBC, 2012) . In Sydney, Australia, 2000, the Organizing Committee tripled the forecasted budget of US$3.8 billion; to make matt ers worse, studies show that their edition of the Olympic Games did not attract t hat many tourist nor boosted the locals’ interest in sports (CNBC, 2012) . The 1998 Olympic Games of Nagano, Japan, cost around $10 billion, which resulted in a recession for the city; moreover, the Games did not deliver impressi ve returns for the local hospitality industry (CNBC, 2012) .", "Nonetheless, in September 2013, when Tokyo was announced to host the 2020 Summer Olympic Games, the news were received with happiness by the Japanese. According to The Economist (2013) , the main reason why cities want to host the Games so badly is that they a re popular with taxpayers – and they will probably cover most of th e costs involved in hosting the mega -event. The decision to host the Olympic Games usually involve different agendas from one edition to the next: the Beijing Olympic Games, for instance, intended to show the world the Chinese ability to host a mega -event this size and its purchasing power; the London Olympic Games , in turn, intended to resuscitate deteriorated areas of the city; with the 2020 Tokyo Summer Olympics, Japan intends to boost their economy (The Economist, 2013) . In the case of Rio de Janeiro, the main reason that led Rio de J aneiro to bid to host the Games was to bring sustainable economic, urban and social development to the city (Rio de Janeiro City Hall, n.a.; Knowledge@Wharton, 2010) .", "In the case of the 2016 Rio Summer Olympics, people protested against the public spending on the event (The Economist, 2013) . However, in an interview to Carta Capital (2013) , the city’s mayor at the time, Eduardo Paes, argued that investments would not be confined to the richer sections of the city, but would also involve other areas, resuscitating deteriorated areas and investing in public transportation.", "Looking back, a ccording to the IOC, the use of arenas has remained largely on paper (Reuters, 2018) . The Velodrome caught fire twice, Arenas I, II and III are used only sporadically, the handball arena was supposed to turn into four schools, but there are no funds for the project . The Olympic Village turned into condominiums but sales are not doing great. However, investments in infrastructure and transportation paid out, such as the subway extension from Ipanema to Barra da Tijuca and downtown Ri o’s port area , which has been completely refurbished , recognized as a place people can go to hang out (Miami Herald, 2017) . This problem does not seem to be restricted to the Olympic Games. Lollapallooza , for instance, is a music festival that in 2019 had its most recent edition in São Paulo, Brazil (Lollapalooza, 2019) . The event organizers, GEO Eventos, in an interview to a popular Brazilian magazine, Veja (2013) , admitted that they suffered losses in their first Brazilian edition, back in 2011. The high costs are mainly related to the million -dollar expenses to bring international artists to the country, a recurring situation in Brazil (Revista Veja, 2013) .", "Therefore, one might observe that the financial bottom line for hosting a mega -event is not always positive . However, they are still very popular. Then, it is relevant to investigate and analyze the other r easons that make hosting a mega -event worthwhile, if there are any, and the intangible objectives it is hoped to achieve from them.", "1.2 ACADEMIC RELEVANCE", "Mega -events are usually the subject of scientific studies that aim to investigate their many impacts on a host country or city (Gibson, Qi, & Zhang, 2008; O’Reilly, Ly berger, McCarthy, Séguin, & Nadeau, 2008; Parent & Séguin, 2008; Porter & Fletcher, 2008; Tien, Lo, & Lin, 2011; Xing & Chalip, 2009; Kim & Walker, 2012) . Among these studies, some discuss psychic income, defined by Crompton (2004, p. 49) as “the emotional and psychological benefit residents perceive they receive, even though they do not physically attend sports events, and are not involved in organizing them. ” The idea behind the rationale, that had its roots in economic theory, was to find an alternative to economic reasons that would make hosting megaevents worthwhile. The psychic income paradigm, then, looks inward, to the community’s residents, trying to find and measure the intangible benefits they receiv e from an event this size (Crompton, 2004) . Crompton (2004) thus proposed seven dimensions to psychic income applied to sports marketing. Based on this conceptual framework, Kim and Walker (2012) conceptualized a scale to try and measure psychic income.", "Their results were different than the conceptual model originally thought by Crompton (2004). A possible explanation for this divergence lies in the choices they made during the statistical analysis. On their study, for instance, they used principal components for extraction . This technique, however, is more recommended under the assumption of unidimensionality of the scale. On this study, different choices were made. Therefore, it is relevant to study if replicating the study in another context, making different technical choices during data analysis, the results will be closer to conceptual model found in the literature for Psy chic Income. Hence, the present study aimed at adapting and testing the scale used in the study undertaken by Kim e Walker (2012) . The authors investigated the perception of the impact caused by the Super Bowl XLIII on locals of Tampa, FL , USA . In turn, this study investigated", "the perception of the impact caused by the Rio 2016 Summer Olympic Games on residents native of Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil.", "An adaptation of the scale was needed since the original is in English an d also because Kim and Walker (2012) concluded that the results of their study could not be generalized to other contexts, since the perception of the intangible benefits could vary from one mega -event to the next.", "In sum, the present study uses the psychic income paradigm as its theoretical background, to research the social impact from the Rio 2016 Olympics, using as method Exploratory Factor Analysis (AFE), Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) and Structural Equation M odeling (SEM). In turn, its objective is to adapt the scale used by Kim and Walker", "1.3 MANAGERIAL RELEVANCE", "The subject is relevant because understanding the intangible benefits of mega -events might aid government of ficials in their decision to host an event this size, especially if the promise of economic returns are not exactly guaranteed when the subject is mega -events. Also, from a political standpoint, the subject is relevant to shed light on how cariocas (residents native of Rio de Janeiro) perceived the event and if they felt the government should have invested on other areas instead.", "1.4 STRUCTURE OF THE STU DY", "This study was organized as follows: in the first chapter, Introduction, the objective of the study, its context and relevance were detailed; in the second chapter, Theoretical Background, it was discussed the definition of a mega -event, a brief history of the Olympic Games, the impacts of mega -events (social, political and economic) and the psychic income paradigm; in the third, Research Hypotheses, the seven hypotheses are detailed, coupled with the conceptual model; in the fourth, Method, the research qu estion was presented, as well as its objectives, scope, nature of the study, population and sample, the construction of the instrument of data collection, and the method of data analysis; later, it will be added the chapters of the Discussion and Conclusio n, including research limitations and suggestions for future research. In the appendix, the i nstruments of data collection are presented.", "2 THEORETICAL BACKGROU ND", "The following section will first address the definition of mega -event , discussing its importan ce. Then, it will be presented a literature review on the Olympic Games, the mega - event analyzed in the present study, highlighting its main stakeholders. Afterwards, the impacts of mega -event s will be covered. Finally, the Psychic Income paradigm will be presented.", "2.1 DEFINITION OF MEGA -EVENT", "In order to understand w hat is a mega -event , it is paramount to first discuss the definition of an event. It is marked by human involvement , there is a pre -determined chronological dimension to it, with a high degree of planning, all the while generating media attention, which makes it very important to tourism. Therefore, an event is usually treated in a special way, given its rare or unique nature (Reiter, 2010) .", "A mega -event , in turn, is an event of extraordinary proportions. Just as an event, it can be of various kinds – cultural, economic, political (Reiter, 2010) . The study of mega -event s might be a complex matter. This is because they involve mu ltiple areas with low correlation with one another , which makes harder to produce content on them. Another factor is its unique or rare nature, which requires a specific analysis to each mega -event , which might render them a part of history that little can be learned from (Roche, 2000) .", "In order to classify an event as a mega -event , one needs to take into consideration its size, duration and frequency (Reiter, 2010) . Moreover, mega -event s have a great cultural impact, international significance and they are usually organized by national governments and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) (Roche, 2000) .", "There is a certain difficulty in defining a mega -even t in terms of size, given it is a relative concept. Thus, it is often said that a mega -event exists on a continuum of size, significance and reach. On practical terms, the benchmarks to measure the size of a sport mega -event are, for instance, number of at hletes, live spectators and television viewers. In addition, these aspects generate other measures worth mentioning, such as the number of television hours that were dedicated to the event, the number of tourists there were present, among others. Nowadays, even the interaction of people on social media must be taken into consideration. Since this analysis is rather complex and very subjective, some authors would rather focus on the economic returns related to a mega -event (Maenning & Zimbalist, 2012) .", "In relation to the duration, an occasion such as a mega -event might have varying degrees of duration: some days, weeks or even go on for an indefinite amount of time. The most common case are the Olympic Games, but there are other fa mous mega -event s, such as the FIFA World Cup, UEFA, Rock in Rio, among others (Reiter, 2010) .", "Mega -event s might also be marked by its frequency, whether they are recurring or non - recurring, or whether they happen regularly or irre gularly (Reiter, 2010) . The Olympic Games, for instance, happen every four years. Rock in Rio was born without a regularly scheduled frequency, happening on 1985, 1991 and 2001. However, ever since 2011, it takes place every two years. The 2019 edition is scheduled for the end o f September and beginning of October at Rio de Janeiro (Rock in Rio, 2019) .", "2.1.1 The Importance of Mega -event s", "The study of mega -event s is relevant to understand how events of this nature contributed to globalization, given the oppor tunity to the diffusion of cultural values on modern society, both on a national and international level. The mega -event s of highest visibility are the Olympic Games and the World Expos. However, specific sport competitions, such as the FIFA World Cup espe cially, are also very important in this context, given that its growth is parallel to the Olympics itself (Roche, 2000) .", "On an international level, cultural and artistic events, such as film festivals (Cannes, Venice, Sundan ce, etc.), music (Rock in Rio, Lollapalooza, Coachella, etc.), derive from the main mega -event s. In the case of sports, there is the Rugby World Cup, Tour the France Cycling, Wimbledon Tennis, UEFA Champions League, among others. On a national level, many events carry cultural symbolism and are part of the social fabric of many c ountries, such as the Super Bowl in the United States (Roche, 2000) .", "2.2 THE OLYMPIC GAMES", "The first edition of the Modern Olympic Games was hosted at At hens, Greece, in 1896. Taking into consideration both summer and winter editions, the mega -event has occurred more than 50 times. In the beginning, the Olympics were usually hosted in North America and Europe. However, there has been an effort to better di stribute the event among the continents. Especially in the last 50 years, this endeavor has contributed to popularize the event.", "The transition of the Olympic Games from event to mega -event did not happen overnight. The literature suggests that, in the beg inning , the International Olympic Committee (IOC), non -governmental organization resp onsible for the Olympic Games, did not have access to the amount of funds they have nowadays. Therefore, the event used mostly the infrastructure already in place in a giv en city or it happened simultaneously with another event (Frawley & To illustrate the growth of the Olympic Games over the course of a century, it is enough to compare the magnitude of the first edition, in 1986, and the last edition of the Summer Olympic Games, in 2016. In Athens, 1896, just 311 athletes from 11 nations p articipated in the event (Segrave & Chu, 1996) . More than a 100 years later, in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, more than 10.000 athletes from 207 countries competed in the Olympics (Olympic Movement, 2016) . The difference between the allocated budget for the mega -event in the last 30 years suggests that its growth curve was highest during this period than ever before (Frawley & Adair, 2013) . For the 1988 Seoul Olympic Games, for i nstance, almost US$1.3 billion were invested (Segrave & Chu, 1996) . In London, 2012, almost US$15 billion were invested to host the mega - event (Flyvbjerg & Stewart, 2012) . Rio 2016 is not far b ehind, with the media reporting an investment of around US$13 billion for infrastructure alone (Folha de S. Paulo, 2016; Reuters, Another factor that might be attributed to the recent growth of the Olympics is its comm itment to host the mega -event in conjunction with the Paralympic Games, ever since the 1988 edition, in Seoul. The partnership between the IOC and the IPC (International Paralymp ic Committee) has increased the complexity of the project, since the infrastru cture must accommodate the needs of both events. This is true for the sport venues and also for other facilities, such was the Olympic Village, the Media Village, etc. (Frawley & Adair, 2013) . The media participation also has also boosted the growth of the mega -event. The first Olympic Games to be commercially televised live happened in 1960. In order to acquire the transmission right s for the United States alone, CBS paid US $394.000. Forty year s later, another North American network, NBC, paid IOC US$1.27 billion to broadcast the 2000 Summer Olympic Games and 2002 Winter Olympic Games . This numbers are even more staggering since they represent the broadcast rights for the transmission of the meg a-event of a single country (Segrave & Chu, 1996) . In 2011, NBC agreed to a US$4.4 billion contract to", "broadcast the Games through 2020, after a bidding war with Disney’s ESPN/ABC and News Corp.’s Fox Sports. In 2014, for US$7.7 5 billion, NBCUniversal agreed to a contract extension to broadcast the Games through 2032, covering six Olympics, from 202 2 to 2032. The deal includes all media platforms including TV, internet and mobile (USA Today, 2014) . The mobile nature of the Olympic Games require s a bigger responsibility with the project, since the event has never been hosted twice in the same city consecutively. This scenario entails challenges that will vary geographically, as well as the need to assemb le local teams good enough to guarantee the success of a new edition of the mega -event (Frawley & Since it is the biggest sport event in the world, the Olympic Games are extremely popular, and countries that wish t o host the mega -event launch formal bids for the right to do so, and the IOC chooses the eventual winner. In order to understand the reasons why so many cities bid to host the Olympics, one needs to understand the global context in which they are part of (Frawley & Adair, 2013) .", "Ever since the 1980s, capitalism is expanding in developing countries, especially in Asia. Moreover, the world has seen the growth of technologies that help information to be mass - circulated. Through globalization, many companies have used sports marketing to expand their business to growing markets (Frawley & Adair, 2013) .", "This juncture puts into perspective the decision of countries to launch a formal bid for an event of this magnitude. Hosting the Olympic Games means obtaining national and international recognition. It means making the whole world talk about the host country during two weeks. The desired results of all this attention usually are economic, political or social (Horne & Manzenreiter, 200 6).", "The selection process to host the Olympic Games begin ten years prior, when the IOC invites all NOCs (National Olympic Committees) to declare their interest in bidding to host the mega -event , which they call the Invitation Phase. During this perio d, the IOC organizes workshops with potential candidates , giving them a opportunity to learn more about the best practices to put together a bid for the event that will best serve the city’s long -term objectives. The IOC puts great emphasis on legacy and sustainability from the very beginning of the selection process, as they believe it will be a catalyst for the development of the city (Olympic Movement, 2019) .", "The following year, the Candidature Process begin with cities prese nting their formal bids. During the two subsequent years, the IOC receives and evaluate the bids. After the evaluation, a city is chosen to host an edition of the Olympic Games in a Host City Election by the IOC Session . The candidature process has three stages in which cities will present three official submissions covering different elements of the cities’ proposals : (1) Vision, Games Concept and Strategy; (2) Governance, Legal and Venue Funding; (3) Games Delivery, Experience and Venue Legacy. When a city is elected, it will have seven years to prepare for the event (Olympic Movement, 2019) .", "Each bid is tailored to help the city achieve its long -term development objectives . In the case of Rio de Janeiro’s bid, for instance, according to a report published by Rio de Janeiro’s city hall, the main reason that led Rio de Janeiro to bid to host the Games was to bring sustainable economic, urban and social development to the city:", "The city’s decision to bid to host the 2016 Games w as made based on a long -term vision: to grasp the opportunity that a successful bid would offer to transform Rio into a better city in which to live, work and visit. The 2016 Games could boost growing and sustained urban and social developments in the city . A unique opportunity was spotted to implement some important infrastructure projects, promised decades ago but never executed, bringing about comprehensive urban renewal. Challenges such as improving urban mobility, revitalizing neglected areas such as t he port region, controlling floods and expanding the sanitation infrastructure are examples of public policies that could benefit from Rio being elected. The Games could help to reduce geographic and social divisions and help better integrate the city and all its different regions.", "Based on this vision, Rio developed its bid plan, establishing close relations between the sports competitions and the legacy for the city’s infrastructure . As a result, Rio de Janeiro entered the race, giving the International O lympic Committee (IOC) a bid with a clear proposal aimed at the Olympic legacy, which would also extend beyond borders, given that a South American city had never before hosted the event. The bid’s motive was the main message contained in the proposal: to make the 2016 Olympic and Paralympic Games, if held here, represent a turning point for Rio, entering world sporting history as the Olympic Games of Transformation (Rio de Janeiro City Hall, In an usual move by the IOC, in 2017 , two cities were chosen at once : Paris for the 2024 Summer Olympic Games and LA for the 2028 edition. In the words of the IOC President, Thomas Bach:", "“This historic double allocation is a ‘win -win-win’ situation for the city of Paris, the city of Los Angeles and the IOC . (…) It is hard to imagine something better. Ensuring the stability of the Olympic Games for the athletes of the world for the next 11 years is something extraordinary ” (Olympic Move ment, 2017) .", "As of 2019, it was decided that the next editions will be: 2020 Tokyo Summer Olympic Games; 2022 Beijing Winter Olympic Games; 2024 Paris Summer Olympic Games; Milan -", "Cortina 2026 Winter Olympic Games; 2028 LA Summer Olympic Games (Olympic Movement, 2019) .", "2.2.1 Olympic Games’ Stakeholders", "The International Olympic Committee (IOC) hold the rights to the Olympic Games. Similarly, the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) hold the rights of every aspect of the Paralympic Games. When a new city is chosen to host the mega -event, the IOC “leases” the rights on the Games. As soon as th e event ends, the rights are reverted back to the IOC. It is important to highlight that the IOC holds decision rights on every aspect related to the Olympic Games, while the National Committees are the actors operational and legally responsible for the Ga mes (Parent, 2013) .", "The bidding committee becomes the Organizing Committee when their city is elected to host an edition of the event. During the seven years of preparation, the Organizing Committee will deal with the IOC; national and international sports federations; non -governmental organizations (NGOs), such as the World Anti -Doping Agency (WADA), the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS), among others (Parent, 2013) .", "During the final phase of preparation, other stakeholders will be involved in the event, since the Olympic Committees will be dealing with : both the IOC and other Olympic Committees in order to prepare reports and transfer knowledge; sports federations; management of any legal issues that arise in this phase, etc. Up until one year before the event, the Organizing Committee ceases to exist. The described processes mark the amount of stakeholders involved in the organization of the Olympic Games during its various phases (Parent, 2013) . Among the most important stakeholders to ensure the success the event are the employees and volunteers of the Organizing Olympic Committee, local government, the city’s community, sponsors, media, sports federations and international sports delegations. Am id this context, every stakeholder mentioned so far expect different returns on their investments, that might be tangible, intangible, or both (Parent, 2013) .", "For instance, (1) the employees and volunteers might hope to deve lop their skills and to have networking opportunities; (2) governments might be focused on the economic return on investment generated by the event, on the opportunity to increase the visibility of the city/country and foster national pride; (3) members of the local community usually hope that", "the event bring some sort of positive legacy to the city, in the form of new infrastructure, but also feel the desire to extract some fun from the event; (4) sponsors are more worried with visibility, in hopes that it translates into sales increases (companies such as Coca -Cola Company and McDonald’s are frequent sponsors of the Olympic Games, what suggests they are satisfied with the ROI of their participation); (5) the media might aim to sell their products, be them physical or digital. Thus, in the months leading up to the event, they will discuss the Olympic Committee at length, even if the news paints it on a negative light. Therefore, their visibility also increases; last but not least, (7) athletes, motivated by their desire to win, feel that the quality of sports facilities and other services available to them (such as the Olympic Village) are essential to ensure their teams’ performance (Parent, 2013) .", "2.3 IMPACTS OF MEGA -EVEN TS", "Mega -events are usually assessed in terms of their economic, political or social impacts.", "2.3.1 Economic Impacts", "There are many studies that aim to measure or debate on the economic impacts related to mega -events (Li & McCabe, 2013; Tien, Lo, & Lin, 2011; Porter & Fletcher, 2008; Frawley & Adair, 2013; Maenning & Zimbalist, 2012) , although there is also a discussion on whether this economic return gene rated by them is real (Crompton, 2004; Kim & Walker, 2012) . In order to discuss the economic impacts, one should, first, distinguish them from financial impacts. The former involve wider aspects of the economy of th e host country , such as reducing the unemployment rate, GPD growth, attracting foreign investments, etc. The latter are more related to the impacts of the organization of the event itself, such as budgetary concerns , for instance (Tien, Lo, & Lin, 2011, p. 13) .", "The desired objectives of hosting a mega -event usually have an economic angle, in hopes that the occasion is able to contribute to the development of the local economy (Frawley & Adair, 2013) . This happens because hosting a sport event represents an unique opportunity to promote the lifestyle of the local population and its products, boost tourism, create new jobs (even if they are mostly temporary), improve trade possibilities, make the city more attractive to new businesses (Lee & Taylor, 2005) , among others. A successful mega -event might even lead to the sustainable economic development of the host city (Tien, Lo, & Lin, 2011) .", "It is difficult to measure the economic impact because it is usually longitudinal. In the case of the number of visitors during mega -events, for instance, the literature suggests that even in the cases that this number fall short of the expected during t he event , the tourism inflow will increase in following years. This is possible due to the positive image reconstruction of the city, that will bring more tourists to the city throughout the following years (Lee & Taylor, 2005) . In recent years, the economic rationale behind governments’ decision to host a mega - event is also related to a destination marketing strategy. Literature suggests that national and regional marketing efforts are able to create an image of the place that w ill later be important for the city to be recognized as a coveted tourism location (Funk, Toohey, & Bruun, 2007) . In 2012, when London hosted the Olympic Games, it received less tourists than the same period the year prior (CNNGo Staff, 2012) . The following year, however, the city set visitation records that were not seen since 1961. The London mayor at the time attributed this increase to an “outstanding mix of culture, art, music and sport to b e foun d” there (BBC Staff, 2014) . Beijing, China, on the other hand, showed decline in the tourism sector after the Olympic Games in 2008. This fall might be, however, also related to the financial crisis of that time period (Dyer, 2009) .", "The Olympic Games also have great potential for the creation of new jobs, both involved directly with the organization of the event and the services industry in general (Malfas, Theodoraki, & Houlihan, 2004) . For London 2012, more than 100,000 new jobs were created (Prynn, 2012) . The estimates for the creation of new jobs for the previous edition of the Games in Beijing, China, were around 1.8 million new work posts (Reuters, 2005) . Even though the Olympics create jobs, it should also be noted that they are mostly temporary and low -paid (Malfas, Theodoraki, & Houlihan, 2004) .", "In an study undertaken to measu re the economic impact of the Summer and Winter Olympic Games of 15 cities that hosted 22 editions of the Games, it was suggested that the economic impact over time is not significant if one observes the following indicators: GPD, unemployment rate and inv estment rates (Tien, Lo, & Lin, 2011) . Therefore, even though it is intuitive to assume that hosting the Olympic Games will present a positive economic impact, this does not seem to be the best way to achieve economic objectives that generate long -term benefits to the host city (Crompton, 2004; Kim & Walker, 2012) .", "2.3.2 Political Impacts", "It is hard to dissociate mega -events from the political context of its time period. The Olympic Games, throughout its history, have also been used as a political tool. The examples of the 1936 and 1952 suggest that the Olympic Games do not exist on a “apol itical bubble” In 1936, the Summer Olympic Games, in Berlin, were used to legitimize the Nazi regime of Adolf Hitler (Segrave & Chu, 1996) . When IOC decided, in 1931, t hat the Games would be in Berlin, this movement represented the German reintegration to the rest of the international community after World War I. However, two years later, Hitler became Germany’s chancellor and, soon after, turned the country into a dicta torship. His regime was marked by the purification of the German race, mainly through anti -Semitism (United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, 2003) .", "At that time, Jewish athletes were persecuted, which led the United States and other democratic western countries to question the morali ty to host the Olympics in Germany. However, German officials were successful conveying to the IOC an image that the athletes were being treated fairly, and the event was allowed to proceed (United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, 2003) .", "The Berlin Olympic Games were the perfect opportunity to heavily broadcast Nazi propaganda, with impressive public spectacles, outstanding sport performance and a warm welcome to visitors . Its two weeks hid, however, an oppressive dictatorship marked by racist nationalism and German imperialism (United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, 2003) . In 1952, Olympic Games in Helsinki, the Soviet Union participated for the first time after 40 years boycotting the event for its bourgeois nature. In the following years, during the Cold War between the United States and Soviet Union, the Games would be used for ideological propaganda and prestige (Nickerson, 1995) .", "This political context led to stressful moments during the 1980 Olympic Games in Moscow, Russia. The 1970s were marked by oil crises and violence in the Middle East , and dissatisfaction of North Americans with the direction their go vernment was taking. Some people even suggested that, at this point, the Soviets were winning the Cold War. Therefore,", "the 1980 edition of the Games marked an increase in the hostility between the two countries, that used the event as a metaphor of the cir cumstances they were living in (Nickerson, 1995) . This situation was apparent during a hockey game between the United States and the Soviet Union in the semifinals. Reports of the match illustrate that, for both countries, the m atch represented, ultimately, a battle between capitalism and socialism, encouraged by the nationalist Olympic environment, giving new meaning to the North American win over the Soviets (Nickerson, 1995) .", "2.3.3 Social Impacts", "Sports m ega-events have the potential to strengthen local customs and values, as well as encouraging the local population to practice more exercises. Through a mega -event such as the Olympics, it will be possible to increase national pride, showing the world the b est facet of the host country. These benefits are prone to enhance the quality of life of those most affect ed by the mega -event, the locals (Malfas, Theodoraki, & Houlihan, 2004) . Some social impacts of mega -events that might be noticed during the event and are often mentioned are related to changes to the local lifestyle, such as traffic jams, environmental pollution, noise pollution and visual pollution (Lin, 2013; Kim, Kang, & Kim, 2014; Liu, 2015) . In order to deal with the traffic jam issue, making the experience of hosting a mega - event the size of the Olympic Games smoother both for visitors and locals, it is necessary to invest in transportation infrastructure. In regar ds to pollution, governments usually invest in improvements in the air and environment quality as part of their brand ing strategy for the city (Lin, 2013) . Preparing a branding strategy for a country or city has been a recurring resource of government officials, especially when it is related to mega -events (Knott, Fyall, & Jones, 2015) . The aforementioned investments are part of t he mega -event’s legacy to the city, bringing long - term benefits (Lin, 2013) .", "The experiences of volunteers were also analyzed in the literature (Ribeiro & Correia, 2020) . Organizational , infrastructural and environmental issues that happe n during the Games influence volunteers per ception , which might lead to volunteer drop -outs and influence the experiences of other stakeholders (Ribeiro & Correia, 2020) .", "One c riticism on the Olympic Games, given its size, is that the mega -event might enhance the gaps between many sectors of society, which might turn life more difficult for the", "poorer. The city that will host the event tends to go through real estate speculation , in which rent and property prices increase (Malfas, Theodoraki, & Houlihan, 2004) . Often, dwellers are relocated to other areas, in negotiations in which they have little bargaining power. However, these urban investments have an important role in renovating deteriorated areas of the city and local housing standards (Lin, 2013) .", "The Summer Olympic Games of Atlanta, 2008, illustrate the social negative impacts stemming from a sport mega -event this size. In the years leading up to the Games, around US$350 million in public spending were diverted from building af fordable housing to investments in infrastructure for the mega -event (Malfas, Theodoraki, & Houlihan, 2004) . Inside the literature on social impacts of mega -events, the Psychic Income paradig m aims at further discussing the inta ngible benefits people from the community hosting the mega - event might accrue from it.", "2.4 PSYCHIC INCOM E", "This section will briefly discuss the origins of the concept and its usage in the present study . While this study present study uses psychic income applied to the field of sports marketing, instances of the term can be found in economic theory.", "2.4.1 Psychic Income in Economic Theory", "Fetter (1915) discussed the idea of income, making a distinction between “real” and “monetary” income. According to him, the former is related to material items individuals receive to fulfill their desires, such as bread and butter, while the latter is a sum of money a person receives to purchase the goods they desire. Fetter (1915, p. 26) calls it “a means to an end”.", "In addition, he argues that many choices people make are not driven only by real or monetary income, for they exist in the sphere of feeling. Fetter (1915) uses as an example services one does for oneself, such as the satisfaction an artist can reap from engaging in a creative activity. This pleasure is not simply measured on mo netary terms, and he called it psychic income . Thus, Fetter (1915, p. 27) defines psychic income as “desirable results produced in the realm of feeling by valuable objects or by valuable changes in the environment which accrue to or affect an economic subject within a given period ”.", "Terborgh (1928) argues that psychic income is not a simple concept to grasp. It entails that people's \"stream of enjoyments\" (p. 75) are measurable and comparable between individuals. However, gathering a sample that would allow the researcher to compare experiences amongst subjects and identify the sources of psychic income is a daunting proposition. For hi m, one would have a hard time reaching a percentage of how much of a subject's psychic income is due to countless mundane aspects of life, such as the weather, work, religion, marriage or graduate school.", "Thus, he investigates if there might be a way to in directly measure one's psychic income through Alfred Marshall's total utility concept. According to Marshall (1890) , prices are influenced by how much customers are willing to pay for a product, and this willingness -to-pay is, in turn, related to the utility they are going to derive from it. Therefore, Terborgh (1928) argues that the total utility could be measured withdrawing an element from the equation and observing the difference it makes to the whole.", "However , while this line of thinking seems reasonable, it would be tricky to observe the contribution of an intangible element if, in its absence, it would make none. Terborgh (1928) compares this s ituation to measuring the weight of a single egg in a basked and outside of a basket: one could clearly ascertain how much it weighs; conversely, it would not work with psychic income, for the components are \"complementary and interdependent\" (p. 77) . Therefore, removing an element here would not help in measuring its individual contribution, for its presence is boosted by the presence of the others. Thus, according to Terborgh (1928) , successfully identifying and measuring the components of psychic income would be too hard of a task to accomplish.", "Decades later, however, this very concept would be applied in the field of sports marketing to try to figure out non -economic r easons as to why governments should subsidize any given sports property.", "2.4.2 Psychic Income in Sports Marketing", "John Crompton (2004) used p sychic income to discuss the factors that justified public investment in major league sports facilities. His psychic income paradigm was the basis for the subsequent scale conceptualization undertaken by Kim and Walker (2012) , in the context of sports mega -event s.", "Since sports franchises are private ventures, there is a debate on whether investing public funds on sports venues is a good idea, be it in terms of direct return on investments (ROI) or in more general, intangible benefits derived from the presence of the team on a given city. In addition, Crompton (2004) identified a series of studies that strongly suggest there is no relation between public funding in sports venues and financial returns generated . Therefore, he argues one should look for other factors that justify public funding that are not financial -related. In this context, the author presents four alternate benefits: “increased community visibility; enhanced community image; stimulation of other development; and psychic income” (p. 43) . The first three are focused on reaching outsiders, such as tourists and foreign investments in the community. The last one, psychic income, is focused on reaching the city’s residents.", "Increased community visibility is re lated to a higher attention from the media, especially if it is a major league franchise , given the national appeal of this type of coverage. An argument used by those that argue in favor of public funding for sports facilities has its basis on the relationship between the franchise and the city. According to them, t he franchise is able to attract companies and tourists for the city, increasing its economic base. However, while this sounds like a sound argument, there is no empirical evidence that incre ased media coverage can, on its own, achieve the aforementioned desired effects (Crompton, 2004) . Regarding enhanced community image, what is understood by “image” for Crompton (2004, p. 44) consists of “a mental reconstruction of a place in a person’s mind” . This traditional definition has been expanded to encompass image also as perceived reputation or character . In this context, c ities use place marketing to convey a positive image of the place, in order to attract new businesses, tourists and even residents. For instance, on the years following World War II, the image of a city was defined by the number of skyscrapers it possessed (Crompton, Nowadays , the city’s image, at least in the United States, is very much related to the sports franchise as a symbol for the city. This argu ment was used on a public referendum requesting $125 million for a new sport s facility in Dallas, Texas. Thus, according to Crompton (2004) , there is strong argument to suggest having a major league franchise is a prerequisite for a city to make the leap from being considered a “small city” to a “big city”. Another aspect of this i mage is related t o citizen’s perception of public administration. Since a sports team is a symbol of great proportions, the success of the team translates into the city’s social and economic health, even if there is no empirical evidence to support this line of", "thinking. On the other hand, if the team decides to relocate to another city, this immediately translates to the public as incompetence from the public administration and entrepreneurs (Crompton, 2004) .", "The third benefit analyzed is that being a sports team host city might be a source of development in other areas, non -related to sport, as if it served as the “glue” that attracted investments or even the starting point for a new development project for the city. This is based on the tenet that business es will thrive if they are closer to one another. After all, there must be reasons to attract people to the city center even when the sports season is over (Crompton, It is worth noting that the initiative to stimulate new investments must be planned in such a way that boost local businesses. Therefore, to convince citizens that it is necessary to spend public money in sports facilities, advocates often use an holistic view as an argument . In this scenario, the sports facility will drive the development efforts of the ci ty. On the other hand, others might argue that, oftentimes, stadiums are built in remote area s, where people might enjoy easy access with their cars, given the vast space for parking (Crompton, 2004) . The benefits discussed so far had an outside -in perspective , focusing on reaching external audiences , with an innate economic perspective for receiving a sports team and its facility , given the effort to attract more media attention, more tourists, private investments, among others . Therefore, the psychic income presents itself as an important antithesis to what has been discussed up until this point (Crompton, 2004) .", "The Psy chic Income has internal dimensions, since it is focused on the city’s residents. Therefore, it might be defined as: “(…) the emotional and psychological benefit residents perceive they receive, even though they do not physically attend sports events, and a re not involved in organizing them ” (Crompton, 2004, p. 49) .", "All in all, identification with a team is not directly related to watching the games at the stadium or not. An individual might consider themselves a fan and tak e pleasure in the team’s victories (conversely, to feel sad when they lose), without ever having set foot in a game. A sports team means “ an investment in the emotional infrastructure of a community ”. Therefore, the team represents a tangible focus for social bonding, uniting people regardless of their political affiliations, gender, race, status in the community, income, etc. (Crompton, 2004, p. Sport is also capable of making people forget of their daily tasks, enabling them to escape their reality, serving as a cultural asset, and being a symbol of collective identification.", "There is even a biological explanation for the individual’s identification with their team in the literature. Winning or losing, the chemical composition of the brain is altered, starting from the serotonin levels. The social environment is proven to influence the serotonin levels of an individual. When they win, the levels increase and people get happier; when th ey lose, these levels decline, making people sad or violent, because they feel as if they had also lost (Crompton, 2004) .", "Since there is no scientific way to measure psychic income, public officials need to answer the following question to justify public subsidy of a private sport facility: How much subsidy sports facilities deserve in order to justify the positive experiences they will have upon residents of the host city? (Crompton, 2004, p. 51) .", "In this context, Crompton (2004) argues that a psychic income paradigm is necessary to justify public investment in sports facilities on acceptable grounds. Therefore, the author propose the following dimensions to represent psychic income: (1) community pride resulting from increased visibility; (2) civic pride from being a sport event host city; (3) pride in efforts to resuscitate deteriorated areas; (4) enhanced collective self -esteem; (5) tangible focus for socia l bonding; (6) excitement from the event and visitors; and (7) emotional involvement with a sport event.", "The psychic income paradigm might be used as the basis to identify the psychological impacts of mega -event s on residents of the host city or country (Kim & Walker, 2012) , in accordance with the present study.", "3 RESEARCH HYP OTHESES AND CONCEPTUAL MODEL", "In this chapter, the research hypotheses and the conceptual model will be presented.", "3.1 RESEARCH HYPOTHESES", "3.1.1 Community pride resulting from i ncreased visibility", "The community pride resulting from increased visibility represents the challenge to imbue citizens with a national spirit that will help them be successful hosting a mega -event (Crompt on, 2004; Kim & Walker, 2012) . Thus, the city will to show to the world they are able to do it and their residents will feel proud of the fact that their city are now under global spotlights (Xu, 2006) .", "When a sport event is broadcasted, besides the game itself, the city’s landscapes are also transmitted. During a mega -event , international viewers have an opportunity to get to know a little bit more about the place, making residents proud of showing their city to the world (Kim A sport mega -event is an unique opportunity to advertise new products and services offered in the country (or city). Moreover, through the event, it is possible to broadcast, t o the entire world, an entirely new image of the country. Being able to attract both national and international media a ttention is one of the main reasons why governments decide to host an event of this magnitude (Horne & Manzenreiter, 2004) .", "In the case of the 1996 Summer Olympic Games in Atlanta, a longitudinal study showed that the city’s residents considered, during 1992, 1993 and 1994, that the international recognition was the biggest intangible benefit of the Games. Overall, during the six times the survey was administered in this three -year period, they considered that the intangible benefits were of more importance than the economic ones (Mahalik & Simonetta, 1999) . Evidence collected in the literature suggest there is a positi ve relationship between higher international (and national) visibility and the pride citizens feel to see their city receive bigger media attention (Kim & Walker, 2012) .", "Thus, the first research hypothesis is proposed:", "H1: There is a positive relationship between hosting a mega -event and an increased community pride resulting from increased visibility .", "3.1.2 Civic pride from being a sport event host city", "The civic pride can be described as positive mindset on behalf of the citizens that will host a mega -event (Kim & Walker, 2012) . The literature suggests that every community is in a position to enjoy the intangible benefits of a sport mega -event , for the opportuni ty to celebrate their unique features and stimulate civic pride in their residents (Gelan, 2003) . Even though hosting an event of the size of the Olympic Games might bring negative impacts such as higher urban traffic and noise pollution, the residents of a host city might feel proud of the fact that their city is able to host the biggest multisport event in the world. Since it is an intangible benefit , this pride is often overlooked in studies about the social impacts of mega -event s (Mules, 1998) .", "In studies that investigate the social impacts of hosting a sports team, the results also suggest that there is an increased civic pride derived from this fact (Siegfried & Zimbalist, 2000; Johnson & Whitehead, 2000) .", "Therefore, hosting a mega -event might be related to the increased civic pride among city residents, stemming from a positive mental reconstruction in relation to the event, the positive recognition from outsiders, and the possibility of using the event as a platform to showcase what their city is able to accomplish (Kim & Walker, 2012) . Therefore, the second research hypothesis is proposed:", "H2: There is a positive relationship between hosting a mega -event and an increased civic pride from being an event host city .", "3.1.3 Pride in efforts to resuscitate deteriorated areas", "The discussion on mega -event s might involve, among other topics, the event as a political or ideological instrument, its relationships with sponsors, tourism, the economy, etc. However, these events might also be analyzed in the context of urban processes (Hiller, 2002) and the re novation of deteriorated areas (Gratton, Shibli, & Coleman, 2006) related to the event. In order to win a bid to host a mega -event like the Olympic Games, the preparation of the host city will inevitably involve some form of urban restructuring or infrastructure -building (Roche, 1992) . Mega -event s usually represent the transformation of urban space through the building of stadiums, sport arenas, parks or commercial and residential a reas (Hiller, 2002) .", "The case of Barcelona is among the most discussed in literature as a success story where the 1992 Summer Olympic Games were used as opportunity to promote the city’s urban development (Marshall, 1996; Monclús, 2003; Qu & Spaans, 2009) .", "Since the beginning of the 1980s, important projects to prepare the city for the Games were launched.

Their winning bid to host the 2012 Summer Olympic Games marked the city as the first in history to host the Games three times (1908, 1948 and 2012). The reasons why it was considered and chosen to host the Games again were based on its commitment with sustainability and renovation with the east side of the city, one of the poorest in the country. The projects devised to accomplish these objectives included new residential areas, parks (green areas), investments in public transportation and education, a new shopping center, among others (Cunningham, 2014) .", "Cape Town’s bid to host the 2004 Sum mer Olympic Games also included a plan focused on the city’s urban reconstruction (Hiller, 2002) . Similarly, Manchester , in its failed bid, intended to use the 2000 Summer Olympic Games as an opportunity to recover their economy through urban reconstruction that would be largely financed by public funds (Cochrane, Peck, In the case of Cape Town, their bid involved a plan for the restructuring of the city in a country marked by Apartheid, during a delicate political period (Hiller, 2002) .

Therefore, the sense of community and local pride might increase as the population realizes the government intends to use the mega -event as an instrument to leave a positive legacy for the host city, such as resuscitating deteriorated areas (Kim & Walker, 2012) .

In the Roman Empire, this policy became known as “bread and circuses”, in which the emperor guaranteed food and entertainment to people in exchange for their political passiveness (Murphy & Bauman, 2007) . During a mega -event , both residents and visitors experience an energy that transcends the sport and that can be shared by everyone. This energy is cultivated by minor events that are held during the mega -event ; promotion of informal opportunities for socialization; production of auxiliary events and opportunities to socialize in the sport event itself , to cite a few (Chalip, During the 2014 FIFA World Cup, held in Brazil, for instance, huge screens were placed in host cities, providing Brazilians and foreigners a tangible focus for social bonding (FIFA Fan Thus, the fifth research h ypothesis was formulated:", "H5: There is a positive relationship between hosting a mega -event and an increase d focus for social bonding.", "3.1.6 Excitement from the event and visitors", "Sports events are related to the pleasure both athletes and spectators will feel attending or competing in the event.

Participating in or watching a sports event is a choice on how to spend one’s leisure time and the pleasure one derive from doing so (Green, 2001) .

In addition, consumers might exhibit different levels of commitment, depending, for instance, of their identification with the brand itself (McGehee, Yoon, & Cárdenas, 2003) .", "It is important to take into consideration the perception of residents in planning and hosting an event to ensure its success. Moreover, it is paramount that citizens see the event on a positive light (Ap, 1992) , or its progress might be jeopardized (Gursoy & Kendall, 2006) . When the public opinion is ignored, the event is rarely perceived as an unique opportunity to d eliver a positive legacy to the host city or country. Citizens’ concerns must be addressed on a timely manner, such as the possibility of an increase in taxes; if the event is being treated as something that only the elite will enjoy; or if the local popul ation will be relocated to make room for infrastructure specific to the event, to cite a few. Still, criticism", "related to real estate price increases, traffic jams , noise pollution and other possibilities that might affect the local lifestyle must also be taken into consideration (Hiller, 1990, p. 119) . Literature suggests that citizens’ emotional involvement with the sport event is an important factor for the success or failure of an event (Kim & Walker, 2012) , given the strength residents’ personal involvement will have in their perceptions towards the event (Hiller, 1990) .

As for the criteria for the numbers of factors to extract, the number was fixed in seven, in consonance with the Psychic Income Paradigm (Crompton, 2004) . The next step involved choosing a rotational method for interpretation o f the factors. By rotating the factor matrix, the variance from earlier factors are redistributed to latter ones, achieving a factor pattern that is simpler to be analyzed.

Since factors with less than 0,50 MSA are considered unacceptable, they were selected one by one to be eliminated. The criteria for removal were: those that had factor loading less than 0,5 and significant cross -loadings, i.e., variables that demonstrated significant loading in more than one factor, making interpreting the scale harder. By eliminating those factors with high cross loading, each variable would be related to one factor only (Hair, et al., 2010 ).", "Scale reliability was measured through internal consistency, i.e., the idea that items should measure the same construct, presenting high intercorrelation. Internal consistency can be verified through Cronbach’s alpha, one of the most used estimate s for reliability. The minimum acceptable for Cronbach’s alpha is usually 0,70 (Hair, et al., 2010) . It was also necessary to verify each item’s commonality to assess whether it reaches acceptable levels of explanation. This ca n be measured through the explained variance of each variable (Hair, et al., 2010) .", "Another indicator of factor analysis adequacy is the measure of sample adequacy (MSA).

The measurement model of this study was specified and evaluated in terms of the goodness -of-fit (GOF) analyzing indices such as Chi-Square (χ²), Normed Chi -Square (χ²/gl), Goodness -of-Fit Index (GFI) , Comparative Fit Index (CFI) and Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA).", "A small χ² usually indicates that there is goodness -of-fit between theory and reality. However, large sample sizes will make it harder to achieve GOF , as will adding more constructs to the model. Thus, it is often necessary to use other GOF indices , as is the case in this study. The normed chi -square is a ratio of χ² to the degrees of freedom for the mode l. A χ2/gl lower than 3 is usually considered to be indicative of a good -fitting model (Hair, et al., 2010) . The Goodness of Fit -Index (GFI) is indicative of the quality of the model. It less sensitive to sample size. It ranges from 0 to 1 . Values higher than 0,9 are considered good. Comparative Fit Index (CFI) is an incremental fit index, also ranged from 0 to 1. It is desi rable due to its relatively insensitivity to model complexity . Like GFI, values higher than 0,9 are usually considered good (Hair, et al., 2010) .", "RMSEA is the root mean square error of approximation, an attempt to correct for the χ² tendency to reject models with a large sample or large number of observed variables.

It is computed from the squared sum of factor loadings for each construct and the sum of the error v ariance terms for a construct. A good reference for CR is > 0,7 (Hair, et al., 2010) . Convergent validity was measured through the Average Variance Explained (AVE) . AVE is calculated from the total of all squared standardized factor loadings divided by the number of items.

Histograms of Overall Perceptions Before the Event The apparent rejection to the decision of hosting the Olympics in Rio de Janeiro seems to explain the low results observed in the Psychic Income dimensions before the event. The only dimension that presented means above the middle point of “neither agree n or disagree” was the dimension related to enthusiasm. This resulted was influenced by the item “As Olimpíadas oferecerão entretenimento para os cariocas” (EXT4), that had the hi ghest mean of the survey, 4,27 (see Table 8). On the other hand, the dimension with lowest means was the one related to respondents’ emotional involvement with the event. According to them, they did not", "follow more Olympic sports since they knew th e city would host the Olympics, and its mean was 2,18 (see Figure 4).", "Figure 4. Means of Psychic Income Dimensions and Overall Items Before the Event After the event, responses were considerably different. Analyzing overall variables , the observed means were all more than 4,1, with standard deviation between 2,1 and 2,38 – that is, except for item OVR5, which continued to be the most polarized item of the survey. This means that, with the exception of OVR5, the remaining overall items was rated above the scale’s middle point, that represented “neither agree nor disagree”. OVR5 inquired respondents on whether they would agree in paying more taxes to host the event. The means of OVR5, below 2 (“disagree”) in both samples, suggest that th e respondents, even the ones that were favorable towards the event, would not agree to pay more taxes to be able to host the Olympics. Items 1, 4 and 6 evaluated whether respondents agreed that hosting the Olympics was “the right choice”, “I supported the decision to host” and “overall, I favored”. This time around, people seemed more positive towards the event, with 28,9%, 27,4% and 25,5%, respectively, agreeing completely with the statements, higher from the less than 10% those same items got in the sam ple before the Games. Items 2 and 3 continued to be the highest rated overall items, referring to whether “hosting outweighs the negative consequences” and “it will bring ongoing positive impacts to the city”. Here, 62,4% and 62,7% of respondents, respecti vely, answered with some degree of agreement with the statements (see Figure 5).", "Figure 5. Histograms of Overall Perceptions After the Event Comparing with the sample before the event, in which results suggested people were rejecting the decision to host the Olympic Games, in the sample after the event, results were considerably higher.

After the Games, Excitement, Social Bonding, Community Pride and Civic Pride rated 5,2, 5,6, 5,1 and 5,0, respect ively (somewhere around “I slightly agree”) (see Figure 6).

Initially, AFE was performed with the 43 factors resulting in a KMO of 0,9 81 and Bartlett’s Test for Sphericity was significant (P < 0,001), suggesting the sample was appropriate for factor analysis. The structure presented six factors, with 75,7% of variance explained (see Table 9). The number of factors was below expected, given that the Psychic Income Paradigm points to seven dimensions (Crompton, 2004; Kim & Walker, 2012) . At this point, the dimensions “community pride resulting from increased visibility” (IVB) and “civic pride from being a sport event host city” (SEH) were combined in a single factor. It was also observed the following factors: enhanced collective self -esteem (CSE), tangible focus for social bonding (SBO), excitement from the event and visitors (EXT), emotional involvement with a sport event (INV) and pride in efforts to resuscitate deteriorated areas (DTR) (see Table 9). Even on th e first round of analysis, the results approached what was suggested in the literature.", "Table 9 – Results from the Exploratory Factor Analysis with every variable", "The process of scale purification was then initiated, observing the pre -defined criteria (eliminating factors with factor loading less than 0,5 and those that had significant cross - loadings). In the beginning, only the factor “tangible focus for social bonding” presented less than three items with factor loading higher than 0,5. It was expected that after careful elimination of some items, the other items could group in this factor.", "The first item eliminated was SBO6 (“As Olimpíadas fortalecerão minhas amizades na minha cidade ” / “As Olimpíadas fortaleceram minhas amiza des na minha cidade ”). The choice for this item was due to low factor loading on its original dimension (0,371) and significant cross -loadings with other three factors. After that, the following items were eliminated, in order: EXT2; INV4; IVB1; EXT1; INV1 ; SEH1; SEH5; CSE6; CSE5; IVB2; INV2; SBO1; EXT6; DTR6; SEH6; DTR5 and SBO3. Thus, on the nineteenth round, every elimination option was exhausted, presenting a 25 -item factorial structure grouped in 7 factors, with KMO of 0,967 and explained variance of 83,24% (see Table 10).", "It is worth noting that SBO, Tangible Focus for Social Bonding was left with three items to preserve the minimum of three suggested in the litera ture to properly conduct Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) analysis (Hair, et al., 2010) , although only two presented loading factor above 0,5 even after the scale purification process (see Table 10).

The result with seven dimensions was different than the one reported on the original study from Kim and Walker (2012) . A possible explanation for this divergence was the technical choice for extraction made by them. On their study, they used principal components. This technique, however, is more recommended under the assumption of unidimensionality of the scale.

Examples of Olympic Games editions that ended with deficits are the 2010 Vancouver Olympics , 2004 Athens Olympics, 2000 Sydney Olympics (CNBC, 2012) , among others. Still, many cities are ecstatic to host the Games, as is the case of Japan and the 2020 Tokyo Olympics (The Economist, 2013; Newsweek, 2016; Olympic Movement, 2020) . City officials from Rio de Janeiro, for instance , hoped to resuscitate deteriorated areas from the city and invest in public transportation by hosting the mega -event (Carta Capital, 2013) .", "One might observe that the financial bottom line for hosting a mega -event is not always positive. However, they are still very popular. Then, it is relevant to investigate and analyze the other reasons that make hosting a mega -event worthwhile, if there are any, and the intangible objectives it is hoped to achieve from them.", "The main theoretical background of the research is the Psychic Income paradigm, developed by Crompton (2004) and operationalized by Kim and Walker (2012) , to try and understand public financing of sports arenas investigating the intangible benefits people from the community receive from them. The research objectives were broken down into seven substantive hypotheses that reflected each psychic income dimension. A survey was conducted with people native from Rio de Janeiro living in the city at the time of data collection . Two samples were collected for the present study: one five months before , with 333 respondents, and one another one month after the Olympics , with 1025 respondents . Overall, there were 1058 observations.", "Some adaptations to the survey were necessary to ensure the scale’s application in a Brazilian context, since Kim and Walker’s (2012) original study presente d language barriers (the questionnaire was originally devised in English), the context (their target was residents of Tampa Bay, Florida, USA) and the mega -event itself (Super Bowl XLIII). For this purpose , some items were reformulated to try and capture w hat the construct aimed at expressing and adapt it to the Brazilian context and the mega -event in question. In this case, the 2016 Rio Summer Olympics.", "Data analysis was conducted using a single database, made of both samples . To accomplish this task, it w as used a Difference of Means Test (Two sample T-Test), an Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) and a Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) , verifying reliability , convergent validity and discriminant validity. In order to test the hypotheses, Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) was used with the Maximum Likelihood (ML) technique . As a result, the seven research hypotheses were supported. The results suggest there is a positive relation ship between hosting a mega -event and the psychic income reflexes. In addition , the results suggest that the scale is adequate to measure both the expectations prior to the event and the perception of people afterwards.", "6.2 THEORETICAL IMPLICAT IONS", "In this section , the scientific contributions of the study will be presented in the form of answers to the research objectives questions.", "6.2.1 Question 1: Does hosting a mega -event influence the psychic income dimensions? Analyzing the results obtained, the first question is answered positively, supporting the direct effect between hosting a mega -event and the psychic income dimensions, namely, (a) community pride, (b) civic pride, (c) pride in efforts to resuscitate deteriorated areas, (d) collective self -esteem, (e) social bonding and (f) excitement . The lowest explained variance among constructs was 60,5% .", "The results diverge from Kim and Wa lker’s (2012) study, who created the scale, in the following ways: in their study, community pride and civic pride grouped in a single factor ; collective self -esteem and social bonding grouped in a single factor; excitement appears in two factors, one grouped with involvement, and another three -item dimension made up of only excitement items. Regarding community pride and civic pride, there could be observed a high", "correlation among dimensions in this study. However, when setting parameters in SPSS to extract seven factors, all Psychic Income dimensions are displayed grouped in a single factor. The reaso n for the different results might be due to technical choices during the analysis. Their study used principal components for the extraction. This technique, however, is more recommended under the assumption of unidimensionality of the scale. On this study, it was opted for the principal axis factoring technique, which assumes the multidimensionality of the construct. The result using this technique in line with the conceptual model proposed by Crompton (2004) , which also pointed to seven factors.", "The results suggests, therefore, that this study better reflected the Psychic Income paradigm presented by Crompton (2004) than the study undertaken by Kim and Walker (2012) . 6.2.2 Question 2: Is there a significant difference between expectations prior to the event and perceptions following it?", "Analyzing the results obtained in the difference of means test , it is clear there is a significa nt difference between expectations prior to the event and perceptions following it. Comparing the means , the results suggest that people from Rio de Janeiro did not have good expectations for the event prior to it. From the 25 items of the purified scale, just 2 rated above the scale ’s middle point, that was represented by “neither agree nor disagree”. When analyzing the overall items, the average answer of the five items is also below the scale’s middle point. The apparent rejection to the decision of hosting the Olympics in Rio de Janeiro seems to explain the low results observed in the Psychic Income dimensions before the event. After the event, however, responses were considerably different. Every item from the purified scale rated above 4, expressin g some degree of agreement with the items. The same tendency was observed in the overall items.", "The significant uptick in responses might be related to the choice of running the research less than a month after the mega -event ended. By then, people might still have been imbued of the excitement from hosting an event that size. Thus, it is possible that whatever was responsible for the apparent rejection towards the event before the Games was softened by the end of the event. Future research might focus on r eplicating the study once more, given that it has been four years since the Olympics has ended, to try and se e if perceptions changed in the meantime .", "Also, the fact that the sample before the event pointed to a negative psychic income and the sample after the event pointed to a positive psychic income suggests that the scale is adequate to measure both expectations prior to the event and perceptions following it.", "6.3 MANAGERIAL IMPLICATI ONS", "Before the event, the results pointed to a negative psychic income accrued by Rio de Janeiro’s native residents. This conclusion is in consonance with the results from popular enquires made by local me dia. According to a perception survey released by Rio Como Vamos in 2016 , the number of cariocas that believed the Games woul d bring benefits to the city dropped from 39% in 2013 to 27% in 2015. According to the coordinator of the group, responsible for demanding good public governance from Rio de Janeiro’s public officials, this result might be explained by the financial crisis , the increase in unemployment in the city and by the overall dissatisfaction derived by a plethora of corruption charges (Villela, 2016) . Thus, before the event, not even the expectation to generate social bonds and entertainment to people was able to garner a positive psychic income from residents native to the city. This findings help explain why cariocas disagreed that hosting the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro was a good decision, and fewer still agreed in paying more taxes to do so. During the event , the chatter about the Olympics in the media changed for the better. According to a survey undertaken by Ibope , 57% of Brazilians believed that the country’s image would be more positive a fterwards . For 42% of respondents, the Olympics was good or great , while 30% said it was regular, and 24% said it was bad or terrible. It is interesting to note that although these results seem optimistic toward the event, 62% of respondents said the Games would bring more dama ge than benefits to the country in the long term . Therefore, whatever was responsible for the rejection of the event was still present , although people seemed positively surprised by the event as a whole (Veja, 2016) .", "Accordin g to Ibope ’s CEO at the time, Marcia Cavallari, there was an ambiguity in responses because people could not clearly see the benefits the country could have in the long term. Also, for her, the recession also explained the seeming contraction , because even among the people who are sympathetic towards the event, there are those who believe the country should have had other priorities (Veja, 2016) .", "A month af ter the Olympic Games, TripAdvisor conducted a survey with users around the world . 76% of Brazilian respondents believed the event would bring some sort of positive legacy to the country (Uol, 2016) , in consonance with the results of this study . One of the overall items wondered whethe r people thought the Olympics would bring future positive impacts to the city, and 63% of respondents answered with some degree of agreement with the statement. Additionally, according to Brazilian respondents of the survey from TripAdvisor, 56% believed that the Games helped improve public transportation (Uol, 2016) . The dimension related to the improvement of deteriorated areas of the city presented similar results, with an average of 4,19, slightly above the sca le’s middle point , between “neither agree nor disagree” and “slightly agree”.", "Therefore , the results suggest the Rio 2016 Olympics were able to positively change regardless of the negative expectations people had before the event. Also, these results might be used to inform future decisions on whether hosting an event this size is a good idea.", "6.4 LIMITATIONS AND SUGG ESTIONS FOR FUTURE R ESEARCHES", "The present study presents limitations due to the scale, sample and data collection, and context . Regarding the scale, it was operationalized in English, presenting contextual and language barriers. The back translation process presents limitations, since it is impossible to develop a perfect translation. Also, it was originally thought of in a conte xt after the event, needing another adaptation to capture respondents’ expectation prior to the Olympics. The sample before the event was collected with undergraduate students as respondents, presenting sample limitations, which required a more random sample that could more accurately represent Rio de Janeiro’s population. The sample after the event aimed at a more random sample, however, there should have been more people from one of the city’s zone, Zona Oeste, to more accurately represent its population.", "In the sample after the event, since data collection was aided by the interviewer, i.e., performed orall y by a group of people, even if they were trained to perform the task, it implies the possibility of bias from the interviewer and presents another limitation to the present study (Malhotra, Nunan, & Birks, 2017) .", "The scale was originally created in the context of Super Bowl XLIII and adapted to the context of the 2016 Rio Summer Olympics. In the sample before the event, there was an", "apparent rejection towards the event and since the Games do not exist on a “apolitical bubble” (Nickerson, 1995, p. 73) , the results can only be generalized to the population studied. Therefore, a suggestion is that the study be replicated in other mega -events around the world to see how the scale will perform in oth er contexts and deepen the knowledge on psychic income. Since the present study used a single database containing observations from before and after the Olympics, the purified scale is an attempt at measuring both expectations prior to the event and percep tions after it. Thus, future studies might replicate the study in other mega - events both before and after the event.", "Also, although there is a sample after the event, it was collected a mere month after the Olympics had ended. Thus, future studies might ru n the survey once more with people native from the city of Rio de Janeiro who were and still is residing in the city since the Games. Considering that four years have passed, it would be interesting to try and understand whether the perception after the event is significantly different nowadays.", "REFERENCES Ap, J. (1992).

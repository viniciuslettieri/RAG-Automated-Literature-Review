Article One – Why Do Companies Engage in Sustainability? Propositions and a Framework of Motivations 32 2.3. Article 3 – Balancing Global Corporate Sustainability Engagement in Asymmetric Markets: a Consumer Goods MNE Case Study 78", "1. INTRODUCTION", "1.1. Research problem definition", "The purpose of this study is to advance the knowledge of consumer goods multinational enterprises ’ (CG-MNEs) motivations and engagement with the agenda of Sustainable Development (SD) . The primary objective is to assess whether regional motivations influence the implementation of sustainability activities by these CG-MNE s and how the SD engagement chan ges throughout a company ’s lifetime . This dissertation compares CG-MNEs from a developed and an emerging economy, both with operations in every macro -region of the world , to observe if and how the corporate SD strategy ’s implementation differs in their global operations and subsidiaries depending on local conditions and corporate history.", "The concept of macro -regions and their subdivisions , developed by the UN (United Nations Statistics Division, 2012) , is used throughout this work to delimit regions and countries ’ areas . The macro -regions follow continental borders but also aim to segregate by economi c development as far as possible. There is indication that the level of commitment to social responsibility and sustainability depend s on a company ’s country or regional origin (Sotorrío & Sánchez, 2008) . It influences performance and directly impacts competitive success (Gallardo -Vázquez & Sanchez -Hernandez, 2014) . Thus, it is possible to hypothesize that the engagement with sustainability changes for multinational companies depending on their commitment to this agenda and the institutional arrangements of the locations where they conduct their business . Different authors have discussed these topics, as demonstrated by the extensive literature throughout this study. Two authors , however, were fundamental to present challenge s that inspire d this dissertation: Anselm Schneider (2014) and Luc Fransen (2012) . The first reflected on the integration of economic , ecological, and social considerations into more sustainable business models (Schneider, 2014) . The second proposed forms of national - institutional configurations that affect ed corporate social responsibility differently in different countries (Fransen, 2013) . This work connects the two scholars ’ discussion s while searching for answers related to corporate SD motivations and engagement through time and geographic expansion.", "The study flows from the Introduction to a Development chapter, organized with three independent articles, each examining profoundly one of the three topics – first motivations, second longitudinal , and third regional engagement . An integral analysis is presented in the Synthesis section within the Conclusion chapter , where the central thesis of this dissertation is debated .", "1.2. Context of the topic", "Sustainable Development was a term coined in 1987 by the World Commission on Environment and Development, or Brundtland Commission. Its final report defines Sustainable Development as meeting the present's needs without compromising the future (UN WCED, 1987) . The Brundtland Commission ’s genesis was the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment, which met in Stockholm, Sweden, in June 1972. From today ’s perspective, this conference had a narrower focus, “a common outlook and for common principles to inspire and guide the peoples of the world in the preservation and enhancement of the human environment ” (Sohn, 1973, p. 423). Nevertheless, the 1972 conference was a call for humanity to protect and steward the environment surrounding it and led the UN to install the Brundtland Commission after one decade, in Brundtland ’s report put together a more comprehensive concept of sustainabilit y, going beyond the environment and adding development, a term borrowed from the field of econom ics – “the ‘environment ’ is where we live, and ‘development ’ is what we all do in attempting to improve our lot within that abode. The two are inseparable. ” (UN-WCED, 1987, p. 7). This brand -new concept was further explored and detailed in the three major Sustainable Development global conferences that happened since. The first of such conferences took place in Rio de Janeiro in 1992, called the Earth Summit – United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED). Ten years later, the Rio+10 conference happened in Johannesburg in 2002 under the name of World Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD). Finally, 2012 saw the third international conference on Sustainable Development, the Rio+20, officially named the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development (UNCSD). Each of them pointed to the need to balance the social, environmental, and economic considerations to serve both the present and the future generations and invited businesses to participate in the effort together with the governments and non-governmental groups (United Nations Organization, 1992) .", "These conferences were integrated into a series of international treaties and protocols that advanced the SD agenda globally. Each of them generated specific agreements – the Agenda 21 from Rio ’92, the Johannesburg Declaration in 2002, and the Future We Want from Rio+20 . With the Millennium Goals , the Island States Pathway , the Sustainable Management of Forest Statement, and the 1972 Declaration of Human Environment , they compose the documents the UN SDGs Knowledge Platform consider s the most critical conventions on Sustainable Development as a whole (UNO, 2020) . But other instruments specific to one of the social or environmental aspects of sustainability are listed as vital ancillary treaties to the implementation of the SD agenda. Among those , there are the documents related to children ’s and women ’s rights, the protection of cultural and natural herita ge, and especially the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UNO, 1948) . In the environment al arena, the most comprehensive document ever reached was the Paris Agreement . It was unanimously approved at the UN general assembly in December 2015 as a legally binding treaty to limit global warming “to well below 2, preferably 1.5 degrees Celsius, compared to pre-industrial levels ” (UNFCCC, 2020) . It was a successor to the less ambitious Kyoto Proto col, which was only binding to developed countries under the principle of “common but differentiated responsibilities .” A principle advocated by many developing nations and included in the Rio ’92 declaration that due to greater use of the natural resources stocks, the more affluent nations should be responsible for financing the climate change fight and transferring clean technology to the poorer ones (Martins Diniz, These agreements and conventions increasingly integrated the companies into the realm of proposed solutions for global sustainability. Many new regulations or instruments were imposed by governments or suggested by the business community to address SD, among them , the creation of a Climate Change Exchange in Chicago, USA, the development of the ISO 14000 to standardize environmental management, the imposition of health companies flexibi lity measures to ensure medication supply for less-developed countries via the TRIPS Agreement (Luke, 2013) , among other s. However , the global UN Sustainable Development conferences counted on meek participation of businesses until In this 2012 gathering, prior to the beginning of the UN member countries summit, a Corporate Sustainability Forum happened with more than 2,000 business leaders,", "multilateral and civil society organizations, together with UN agencies (UN Global Compact, 2012) . It is, thus, a novel agenda for some companies while others embraced it early and evolved their business along with it. Conventional business es follow a market logic that targets profits and seem incapable of embracing Sustainable Development ’s complexities (Schneider, 2014) . Most of the corporations currently in operation were founded and prosperous before the emergence of the Sustainable Development concept, but management increasingly accepts their role as global resources ’ scarcity becomes more evident (Luke, 2013) . Corporations have become pivotal for global sustainability both to advance this agenda and reduce their impact on the environment (Diesendorf, 1999; Schneider, 2014) , making them a central focal point for legislators and stakeholders ’ pressure alike.", "In line with these pressures and their gained SD knowledge, some companies adapted to new, more sustainable business models (Bryson & Lombardi, 2009) . The business community also created new structures to support the sustainability precepts . The Worl d Business Council for Sustainable Development was founded in 1995 and grew to direct membership of 200 global companies and 5,000 other associated to 60 country organizations in every continent (WBCSD, 2020) . In parallel, there have been several initiatives to improve certification and reporting in sustainability. The most successful initiatives in the 2010s have been the B Corporations certification , which initially attracted small businesses around the world but have been able to gather the interest and accredit large multinationals (B Corporation, 2020) and the Global Reporting Initiative – GRI, which created a standard for corporate sustainability reporting (Asif, Searcy, Garvare, & Ahmad, 2011; Searcy & Buslovich, 2014) . As the SD in business trend grew, the major stock exchange s have been encouraged to promote indices and platforms on sustainable investing along with companies, investors, and regulators (UN Partnership Programme, 2020) . The most visible and valued index internationally is the Dow Jones Sustainability Index , which evaluates companies and stocks from different countries and exchanges (Robinson, Kleffner, & Bertels, 2011) .", "To be aligned to the global sustainability benchmark, companies and instruments had to adjust to the 2015 -launched UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) framework . There has been a specific concern to address busines ses across the platform . The SDGs are a set of principles and targets within the UN’s 2030 sustainability agenda that aim to", "bring together governments, corporations , and civil society to help humankind overcome its matters and create value for humanity (United Nations Organization, 2015) . These principles are gathered as the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and 169 specific targets. Businesses are an essential part of different SDGs . Reaching the targets will largely depend on their adjustment to this new order, together with governments, NGOs, and individuals.", "Unlike the early days of the SD discussions , corporate participation was organic, mainly through the World Business Council for Sustainable Development. As part of the SDGs is translated into international, national, or subnational legislation, they becom e compulsory for companies. Two of the SDGs are directly related to the business world: SDG 12 focuses on production and consumption and includes a specific target on “adopting sustainable business practices and reporting ”; SDG 17 includes two targets on multi -stakeholder partnerships in order to make sure it entices enough focus and traction. But the whole framework can be, directly or indirectly, addressed by the corporations. Figure 1.1 shows the 17 SDGs approved by the UN assembly.", "Figure 1.1 – Sustainable Development Goals (United Nations Organization, 2015) Among other instruments, the UN created a comprehensive guide for the Food, Beverages , and Consumer Goods Industries to address the 17 SDGs. Called the SDGs Industry Matrix, this guide (UN and KPMG, 2016a) was launched in February 2016 to", "help businesses prepare for this new world, but it is also a reference for lawmakers, pressure groups , and other stakeholders in their interactions with corporations. The guide can also function as a manual to companies in a moment when there is a growing awareness of stakeholders and media regarding socio -environmental aspects, such as climate change, lack of hydrological resources, destruction of biodiversity, ethnic conflicts , and urban violence (Lemme, 2010) . It brings recommendations of certification schemes to improve corporate sustainability, such as Fairtrade or the Saboo Standard for social certification, and examples of companies that are part of the Global Compact , the United Nations’ led corporate sustainabililty initiative for companies that acknowledge the need to operate in a more sustainable mode (Oliveira et al., 2008) and voluntarily commit to programs with the human rights, labor, environment , social, and anti- corruption principles . Each SDG has a “Leading by Example section ” with one or more multinational companies listed , including AB InBev, Arcor Group, Cargill, The Coca - Cola Company , General Mills, Lego Group, Malawi Mangoes, Nestlé, SABMiller, Tetra Pak, and Unilever , among others .", "The SDGs were approved unanimously by the 193 countries officially represented in the General Assembly in September 2015. Immediately after, global, natio nal, and sub- national indicators started to be negotiated for each of the 169 targets. As countries adopt legislation based on the SDGs and have their laws enforced, associated with resources to ensure corporate compliance, sustainability efforts may prove more widespread and effective (T. Chen, Larsson, & Mark -Herbert, 2014) . However, while comprehensive, the UN’s type of guidance can be perceived as soft since adherence to it is not required but rather optional , and regulation can be very lax in several countries , especially in the less developed ones (Epstein & Buhovac, 2014) .", "1.3. Delimitation of study", "This study ’s unit of analysis is the CG-MNE , a multinational corporation that target s and communicate s directly to consumer s. For analy tical consistency , the single focus is consumer goods corporations , since business -to-busines s, infrastructure or other types of companies , as well as local firms, may have different needs and respond to different pressures (Aguinis & Glavas, 2012; Dickinson -Delaporte, Beverland, & Lindgreen, 2010) and, thus, may not allow for direct comparison among them . The United Nations acknowledged the differences by creat ing a Sustainable Development guide for several", "industries – Consumer Goods , Financial Services, Transportation, among others (UN Global Compact, 2015) . Each of them has a specific set of guidelines and exemplary cases that can work as a manual for newcomers or smaller companies , as described in the previous section .", "Also , the focus on multinational enterprises derive s from the fact that companies located in more or less developed countries may face different levels of pressure to implement a sustainability agenda (Nidumolu, Prahalad, & Rangasawmi, 2009) . It is due both to activists ’ pressure groups , more organized in developed countries (Surroca, Tribó, & Zahra, 2013) , and the more strict implementation requirements of the global UN-led agreements for the same richer countries (Amran, Periasamy, & Zulkafli, 2014) . This study, thus, links the companies ’ agenda to their territory of operations. Two CG- MNEs cases land the theoretical propositions presented in the General Research Questions section below and the propositions developed in Article One. As further detailed in the Methodology section below, the corporations selected must be a member of the Global Compact, present themselves as SD-engaged ones, and be recognized by other rankings, memberships, and awards. It must operate directly in every macro -region of the world , marketing to consumers . One of the companies must be headquartered in a developed country and the other in an emerging one. The two countries selected were respectively the USA and Brazil. The companies selected for the case studies were The Coca -Cola Company and Natura&Co.", "The full development of this research project lasted four years. The two first years were devoted to creating the conceptual part of the dissertation. The final two years focused on the fieldwork , analysis, preparation of articles , and conclusion . Interviews with business executives and scholars took approximately one year to complete , from the protocol development to the transcriptions ’ analysis.", "1.4. Relevance", "For Van de Ven (2007) , the first step in creating theory is to develop an idea, even if half- baked , to respond to an anomaly. The role of corporations in Sustainable Development seems like an anomaly in the age of internationalism. It is one area where companies have not taken the global lead, even though business leaders seem to increasingly accept their", "responsibility in this arena (Pless, Maak, & Stal, 2012) . The many examples that compose the UNs industry books (UNO and KPMG, 2016) or the findings on corporate sustainability research (Schneider, 2014) show that their engagement depends on both internal and external conditions and drivers to move the organization (Lozano, 2015) . The institutional environment seems like one of the critical forces shaping corporate social responsibility in different countries (Fransen, 2013) .", "Frasen s (2013) theoretical work proposes future research that may help fill the knowledge gap between the interaction of national policies and the social and environmental outcomes as well as the influence across borders . The present research helps uncover corporate motives for the engagement of CG-MNEs with sustainable development and the regional implications to implementing this agenda . It has been argued that political - economic and cultural local context deeply affect how corporat e social responsibility is viewed and implemented (Gjølberg, 2010) . This dissertation indicate s if there is a pattern for corporate engagement in sustainability and how motivation turns into engagement . If the motivations framework proposed in Article One proves to be adequat e, future studies with industries other than consumer goods may be conducted too.", "For practitioners, this study helps uncover the reasons to embrace sustainability and indicates that this path may lead to improved business results. The cases about large CG- MNEs can disseminate knowledge and best practices. Thus, it is expected that both managers and researchers will be able to appreciate and profit from this study. Research gaps are addressed in section 1.7 below .", "1.5. Conceptual Architecture", "The working definition by Diesendorf is used throughout this project – “Sustainability and sustainable futures are treated here as the goals or endpoints of a process called Sustainable Development ” (1999, p. 22). So, sustainability is a term used as a short format for Sustainable Development .", "The sustainability concept ’s influence has increased significantly through time, turning it into a core element of government and international organizations ’ policies (Mebratu, 1998) . When sustainability was adopted as a social practice in the mid-1900s, it seemed as “antithetical to the work of trained professional managers ” (Luke , 2013, p. 87).", "Criticism grew in parallel with this new influence , and some believe that the Sustainable Development discourse aims to preserve the privilege of corporations instead of preserving the world (Luke, 2013) .", "Still, SD is increasingly a key to granting companies a continuous license to operate in the global scenario, requiring a shift in their corporate model and strategic direction. Schneider (2014) proposes a new logic to businesses, which can become more sustainab le than conventional companies in two different ways. Either as a comprehensive end-goal SD company or a financial performance one with environmental and social performance means to get there , as per Figure 1.2 below.", "Figure 1.2 – Types of corporate sustainability (Schneider , 2014, p. 534 - 538) Market -centered companies have the ultimate goal of contribut ing to the company ’s financial performance by being SD-conscious on the way. Sustainability -centered ones are organizations that have narrow ed into a wholesome means -equation , as in the Triple Bottom Line (TBL) concept . The TBL derives from the well-known bottom -line expression used to describe a company ’s net results (Lemme, 2010) . According to the TBL acronym creator (Elkington, 2004) , its agenda focuses not only on the economic value that may be added but also on the environmental and social value added or even destroyed depending on the decisions taken by the companies . Aiming for TBL, also called the golden triangle, several companies have joined the Global Compact, the pact that includes the UN and corporations toward Sustainable", "Development (United Nations Organization, 2020) . Most of them disclose their sustainability practices in annual reports. This pragmatic approach may bring positive results for companies, improving goodwill and protecting their image with their stakeholders – consumers, media, NGO s, shareowners, gove rnments – and may even be a strategy to increase the perception of more quality relative to competitors, contributing to the long-term performance of companies (Lemme, 2010) . Different studies have used the acronym ESG – Environment, Social, and Governa nce – to also portray the conection between financial success and increa sed sustainability (Beckmann, Hielscher, & Pies, 2014; Cupertino, Consolandi, & Vercelli, 2019; Stellner, Klein, & Zwergel, 2015) , which relate to corporate survival in the long run.", "A successful company must be capable of self-perpetuation, outliving its executives and members (Fleck, 2009) . One of the characteristics of successful corporations is to inspire respect via the positive reputation they build throughout their existence. No company will be viewed positively in the XXI centur y if it does not grow and advance sustainably (Barnett & Pollock, 2012) . Eberle, Berens , and Li (2013) show how companies are increasingly concerned with adverse communication effects on their business. Greenpeace is a well-known NGO that uses, among other tactics, internet videos to corner companies and force them to change their sustainability practices. In March 2010, Greenpeace attacked Nestlé on its purchase of palm oil from a supplier that was supposedly harming orangutans. The video “Have a Break ” (Greenpeace, 2010) shows a Nestlé executive eating an orangutan finger formatted as a Kit-Kat chocolate bar. The video was viewed more than 1.5 million times and generated over 200,000 protest messages, forcing Nestlé to suspend its relationship with the supplier and create a strategy to contain the damage and reach back to its stakeholders, with a promise that, by 2015, all of its palm oil would come from more sustainable sources (The Economist, 2010) . The compan y overcame the issue thanks to the goodwill with stakeholders and change s in its practice s. Goodwill is built through time and depends on how well a company is known and how much its actions make it look good or bad (S. P. Brown, 1995) . Clients assess a company ’s reputation as a sign to predict future action ; thus, a positive reputation can reduce risks (Ruth & York, 2004) . Simultaneously , there are situations when consumers cannot access the quality of a certain product before a purchase, but a positive", "reputation may serve as a sign of this corporation ’s products ’ basic quality (Rose & Thomsen, 2004) , leading to increased sales.", "Together with reputation gains, another longer -term positive result may be shareowner value. Different indexes around the world have been working to capture the possible financial reward of embracing more sustainable business. An example is the Dow Jones Sustainability Index, created as a business tool that helps investors evaluate long-term shareholder value and risk management related to the TBL – economic, environmental , and social developments (EPSTEIN; ROY, 2003) . Multinational organizations have recognized that it may be necessary for their business to turn them more sustainable. However , to make companies progress in their status quo, they need strong calls for change. “The findings [of a longitudinal 25 years ’ study] show that, internally, leadership and the business case are the [main] drivers, whilst the most important external drivers are reputation, customer demands and expectations, and regulation and legislation ” (Lozano , 2015, p. 32). The Thus, both innovation and legitimacy are means to achieve progress while ensuring the company ’s long-term survival.", "The capability of being accepted by public opinion is one of the reputational dimensions, called the “social license to operate ” (Sustainable Business Council, 2013) . The larger the losses, the more incentive companies have to engage with social responsibility (Brammer & Pavelin, 2005) and develop new business models (Boons, Montalvo, Quist, & Wagner, 2013) . The social license to operate is a manifestation of Institutional Theory, and the new business models appear as a response to the need to compete via innovation in processes and products , as predicted by Innovation Theory . Both theories form the theoretical foundation of this work , as better explored in the subsection below .", "1.5.1. Theoretical Foundation – Institutional and Innovation Theories", "Epistemologically, this work is founded on the Sustai nable Development move ment and two main theories that explain the development of corporate sustainability , as described before . The first one is Institutional Theory, which explores the roots for adopting governmental and unwritten communal principles that shape society ’s legitimation (North, 1990) . The second is Innovation Theory, which shows that the economy changes due to increasingly different ways of getting things done (Schumpeter, 1980; Sweezy, 1943) or radically different ways that disrupt previous arrangements (Christensen, 1997,", "2006) . These theories are complementary responses to the need for corporate survival or how companies must adapt continuously to continue existing. Corporate survival is the background thread to the whole study .", "The quest for complying with institutional consensus, or legitimacy , forces leaders to adopt formal policies within their organizations (Meyer & Rowan, 1977) and have become a strong motivation toward Sustainable Development. These policies become fundamental to corporate survival through social judgment ’s subjective approval (Bitektine, 2011) . The institutionalization of Sustainable Development via the United Nations and most national governments made it a desirable business track . The UN created the basis for institutionalizing corporate social responsibility and sustainability and was responsible for influencing governments and companies to follow the same route (Brammer & Pavelin, 2005) . These institutional values became the new, positive “myths ” to be followed by organizations (Barbieri, Vasconcelos, Andreassi, & Vasconcelos, 2010) , which adopted the sustainable models and practices considered better in the contemporary social system. North (1990) described this movement in his comprehensive work – focusing on the overall social environment and governance, institutions create the ground rules that will impact organizations. For him, the institutions are the “rules of the game” in any given society, as they restrain all society’s interactions in politics, economy, or social relations . The institutionalization process , however , is unequal in different societies (Fransen, 2013) as it is built on top of previous institutions via incremental changes that eventually modify the whole edifice (North, 1990) .", "In its way to become institutionalized, SD itself has been constructed on top of the corporate responsibility history (Harlow, Golub, & Allenby, 2013) . Companies are influenced by institutionalization and must adapt to benefit from government policies (Silva -Rêgo & Figueira, 2019) . Some firms lag and resist it or just “greenwash ” their initiatives (Milne & Gray, 2013) . Nevertheless, the Paris Agreement against climate change shows how broadly the SD agenda became institutional for governments, societies, and corporations when all UN countries adhered to it unanimously . The US evaded for a few years but felt the need to return (The Guardian, 2021; The White House, Within companies, the process for accepting and adopting Sustainable Development practices may be better understood with this research. As Sustainable Development", "becomes more institutionalized, corporations may turn the concept into a growt h tool beyond their simple survival. The complexity of generating positive economic, social , and environmental results all at once is not trivial given the uncertainty that innovation, especially radical innovation, brings (Barbieri et al., 2010) .", "Sustainable innovations will most times require radicalness, going beyond just products, processes , and eco-innovation, as they must include social and economic objectives oriented to the future (Boons et al., 2013) . Adapting may be the only possibility, and organizations that can turn the TBL into market advantage can ensure survival . The economy theorist Joseph Schumpeter started discussing innovation in 1911 when he described it broadly, including developing new products, changing production and transportation methods, conquering new markets , and altering organization al structure s. Innovation does not necessarily mean inventing but rather applying new technologies, materials, methods, and energy sources (Schumpeter, 1980) . In the late 1930s , he and his followers proposed that innovation was an activity of individuals called entrepreneurs (Sweezy, 1943) , coining a role that became identified with creativity and inventiveness. Theorists have since compile d increasingly complex and comprehensive theor ies of innovation on top of this foundation (Downs & Mohr, 1979; Sears & Baba, 2011) , agreeing that innovation requires creative energy toward valuable new outcomes . One of the innovation aspects brought by Schumpeter was that of Creative Destruction, a term he borrowed from Karl Marx but described in different terms in his book Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy, published in 1942 . Creative destruction would be capitalism's ability to continuously destroy its status quo and give birth to new structures that will later be destroyed and reconstructed (Schumpeter, 2008) . One step further, Christensen (1997) described the Disruptive Innovation theory as broad transformations that radically change the economy and society through a technological or organizational breakthrough . Disruptive innovation starts with performances below the mainstream practices. However, they accelerate the market and surpass the old technol ogy, turning it obsolete in the long run. For him, innovating should be every managers ’ end-goal as mere ly surviv ing is the opposite of great results: “…the objective function of management should be to maximize shareholder value. If survival is instead the objective function, then quite possibly inaction is a good course of action ” (Christensen , 2006 , p. 50).", "To comply with its corporate purpose, innovation should be learned by exploring new possibilities while exploiting previous certainties (Sarasvathy, 2001) . Included as corporate strategy, innovation should be a tool to allow for adopting sustainable practices throughout the organization , embedded in a long-term orientation program with a sense of urgency (Turner & Pennington, 2015) to ensure survival.", "In summary, this study assumes that SD is increasingly more institutiona lized in the global society and, as companies feel the need to join the sustainability efforts, it becomes a source of innovation that some will seize as an opportunity for growth. The scheme on Figure 1.3 condenses how Institutional and Innovation theories , together with the Sustain able Development concept , act as forces to shape corporate sustainability on a background of corporate survival:", "Source: prepared by author Figure 1.3 – Dissertation ’s supporting theories", "One of the beliefs is that adaptation to corporate sustainability requires both incremental and disruptive innovations. Sustainable innovations should be radical and oriented to the future (Charter, Gray, Clark, & Woolman, 2008) to ensure company survival . However, SD seem s to have entered the companies via an institutionalization process before evolv ing into competitive innovation .", "The systematic search for the first article proposed for this dissertation revealed that the motivations for corporate sustainability most prevalent in the literature are Legitimacy, Market Success, and Process Improvement (Bansal & Roth, 2000; Darnall, 2003; Epstein, 2008; Windolph, Harms, & Schaltegger, 2014) . The financial literature brings a fourth motivation, not used by these authors , coined as Social Insurance (Brammer & Pavelin, 2005; P. C. Godfrey, 2005; P. C. Godfrey, Merril, & Hansen, 2009) and included as a fourth major motivati ng force in the paper .", "Legitimacy and Social Insurance are connected to Institutional Theory , as these motivations derive from a need to comply with rules, regulations , and social expectations of the local business environment , as forecasted by theory (Fransen, 2013) . Market Success and Process Improvement include innovations that allow sustainability to become a tool for competit ive advantage and companies ’ performance (Hall & Wagner, 2012) . The latter motivations foster the development of new business model s (Boons et al., 2013) with the advancement of sustainable innovations , be them disruptive or just increme ntal. These new business models also comply with Schneider ’s (2014) prediction of companies with Sustainable Development as their means - or end-goals, beyond the conventi onal sole profit -oriente d model.", "To reach this dissertation ’s objectives, it is imperative a better understanding of corporate motivations for sustainability. Article One narrows in on the motivations that lead companies to embrace Sustainable Development strategies. It also examines how these motivations are present in the field work of scholars around the world to develop propositions . Articles Two and Three aim to verify these propositions with case studies on CG-MNEs from an emerging and a developed economy .", "Each article adds to this initial Literature Review as needed for their development. However, the theories presented here are the thread between the three articles and the final Synthesis and Conclusion . In the next section s, the research gaps and questions are presented based on the reviewed literature .", "1.6. Research Gaps", "The literature search brought three main gaps that the present work can fill:", "Regional motivation – several authors have researched and discussed motivations for corporate sustainability , as presented before . However, they have not systematize d a theoretical model to deal with the topic , and the definitions were not confirmed on the field with a regional approach , a gap also identified in the literature (Fransen, 2013) . Many field papers describe the motivation s behind a company ’s strategy or action as detailed in the dissertation ’s first article (Article One below) , but not within the boundaries of a framework previously established by the corporate motivation literature. i. Longitudinal Financial vs. Sustainable Development ends – Schneider ’s article with a proposition of business models (Schneider, 2014) has been cited 57 times since its online publication in January 2014 until February 2019. However , only two journal articles presented field cases (Munguia, Varela, Esquexr, & Velázquez Contreras, 2017; Ünal, Urbinati, & Chiaroni, 2018) , both narrowed in single country ’s cases . All other work was theoretical discussions or conference presentations . There is an opportunity to further explore this discussion, evaluating how and why a company turns to one or the other models through time. ii. Emerging vs. Develop ed market MNE s – In the initial search of the corporate sustainability literature , no work was found that contrasts multinational enterprises from an emerging and a developed country , explor ing what motivates their corporate SD practices in different regions of the world . One article hypothesizes that MNEs may be exporting socially irresponsible practices to subsidiaries since stakeholder pressure in their home countries may be more challenging (Surroca et al., 2013) . Although it is robust quantitative research of 110 MNEs from 22 countries , there are no references to emerging versus developed markets . Probably because emerging market s MNEs are a relatively new phenomenon (Gu & Lu, 2011) that have not been as researched as (Figueira, Silva Rêgo, & Mello, 2015) and do not have an international expansion at the same level (Rocha, Mello, Pacheco, & Farias, 2012) of that of developed countries since their motiv ations and practices have not yet been as explored as those of developed markets.", "Thus, it is possible to develop a motivation framework that allows for the longitudinal study of corporate sustainability in emerging versus developed economies ’ MNEs , as proposed in the first article (Article One) of this dissertation .", "1.7. General Research Questions", "This dissertation project was designed using the traditional method of gap finding and filling to develop the questions as there is no settled Sustainability Theory to be challenged . It is a field that still requires incremental research and the creation of complex theory through collaboration and interaction beyond individual researchers ’ capabilitie s (Van de Ven, 2007) .", "The overall Dissertati on questions and research objectives were developed to focus on the gaps found in corporate sustainability literature within the unit of analysis of the CG- MNEs . Thus, the main question to this Project can be summarized as: What motivate s companies to engage with the SD agenda in different regions of the world? How th is engagement evolves through time in CG-MNEs from an emerging and a developed econom y?", "More detailed questions are necessary to determine what should be addressed throughout the three different phases of investigation to follow. The below questions add up to the development of studies :", " What are the main motivations for companies to engag e with the agenda of Sustainable Development ? Is it possible to propose a framework of motivations?  Do scientific field articles indicate differences in corporate motivation s for sustainability in different regions of the world?", " Are there differences between an emerging and a developed market CG-MNE in their on-going engagement to SD? How did the engagement develop over time and was implemented in worldwide operations ?", "It is important to emphasize that the companies which are the subject of Articles Two and Three are already engaged with corporate sustainability, as they are selected among the ones that joined the UN’s corporate effort, the Global Compact.", "1.8.

However, qualitative methods were the best choice", "every time, except for a bibliometric review in Article One. In any case, multiple source s were always employed to triangula te information. The possibility of diving into individual case studies shall provide the texture needed to better understand and describe corporate engagement in global sustainability.", "Article One was developed using two methods of literature search. To determine the corporate motivations for sustainability, snowballing (Babbie, 2013; Wohlin, 2014) was used to track the more comprehensi ve and consensual motivations. In the second part of the article, to find and select the field papers that addressed this topic , a stepwise systematic review (Kitchenham, 2004) was used. These field papers were then submitted to bibliometric processes (Pritchard, 1969; Teixeira, Iwamoto, & Medeiros, 2013) and, finally , individual analysis to allow the development of propositions and a framework used throughout this work.", "For Articles Two and Three , the case study method (Yin, 2009) and protocols (Eisenhardt, 1989; Eisenhardt & Graebner, 2007) was the choice for the field research with companies .

In the former country, 28 are corporations , and the remainder is small and medium -sized businesses. In the case of the US, 39 are corporations. Corporations are the target for case studies in this dissertation since our research unit is the CG-MNEs. Among them, the selection criteria for the case studies were :", "a) Being originally from one of the two selected countries and headquartered in the same market.", "b) Having operations in all macro -regions of the world, according to the UN classification .", "c) Directly managing its subsidiaries (not operating primarily through franchises);", "d) Marketing to consumers, as expected for a consumer goods company . e) Producing periodic report(s) with information about the mission, vision, operations , and sustainability strategy and initiatives .

Propositions and a Framework of Motivations Abstract This article proposes a framework of corporate motivations for sustainability based on the study of engagement with sustainability most prevalent in the different UN -defined macro -regions. Four main motivations were uncovered in the literature: Legitimacy – the perception that the actions are appropriate within a system of norms and beliefs; Market Success – increase in turnover, brand equity, or innovation due to sustainable practices; Process Improvement – sustainability -oriented optimization of processes ; and Social Insurance – preemptive insurance against reputation or goodwill losses. Field articles were selected via a bibliometric review to develop the propositions. They indicate which motivations are of more academic concern in general and for Asia, A frica, Europe, Latin America and the Caribbean, Northern America, and Oceania. Legitimacy appears as the most prevalent motivation followed by Market Success. More developed regions tend to have more studies on Market Success, while Social Insurance seems linked to less developed markets, where corporations must provide access to needs beyond their business.", "Keywords : Sustainable Development; Corporate Sustainability; Corporate Motivation; Business Motivations; Bibliometrics.", "2.1.1. Introduction", "The current arti cle’s objective is to analyze the primary motivations for corporate engagement in the sustainability agenda along time and across different geographies of the world, proposing a conceptual framework that encompasses these concepts. Most of the motives for change seem to be external to the business (Lozano, 2015; Pless et al., 2012) as companies need a strong push to leave their inertia. The mining and heavy industry sectors, for example, soon adopted the idea of a “social license to operate ” as their reason to invest in a more sustainable business model (Sustainable Business Council, 2013) . However, since the early studies on corporate motivations for becoming more “green ” in the 1990s (Dillon & Fischer, 1992; Lawrence & Morell, 1995; Suchman, 1995;", "Winn, 1995) , internal or competitive motivations have also appeared as potential drives of change.", "This discussion on the endogenous or exogenous character of corporate sustainability motivations leads to a reflection that different sources of motivation may lead to different implementation in different markets and also that this may change through time. This article searches for data on how corporate sustainab ility develops in different times and areas of the world to format a framework that can support future field research and professional understanding of how motivations translate into practice. Motivation literature is rooted in psychology, initially descri bed by Sigmund Freud in his seminal study about the unconscious (Bargh & Morsella, 2008) , and later extended to several different areas of study. Many works have been systematized with a focus on motivational drives, or the needs of individuals as described by Maslow (A.H. Maslow, 1943) . The review of Sekhar et al. (2013) on drivers demonstrates that they are directly linked to performance, first at an individual and only then at an organizational level. For them, each person ’s contribution toward the goals of an organization helps form encompassing corpo rate motivations and allows it to succeed.", "The present work narrows in on the corporate motivations for sustainability as systematized by a group of scholars (Windolph et al., 2014) after the work of several authors described in the Lite rature Review section below. It does not aim to focus on the description of drivers for sustainability, which are contained within the broad motivations and are studied by another group of authors, such as Hamidu, Haron, & Amran (2016); Lozano (2015); Lozano & Haartman (2017); Okereke (2007) , among others. It ’s worth noting that the literature on corporate motivations for sustainability builds upon previous, and parallel, research on motivations for Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) as well. There are als o references in the literature to individual motivations of leaders – attitudes of top management, board members, or influential executives within corporations. However, this article follows the point of view of Windolph et al. (2014, p. 273) and concentrates on corporate motivations that are “generally relevant for business and potentially interesting to any company ”, instead of decisions taken by powerful individuals. Although literature stresses t he importance of management attitude and belief in the improvement of a company ’s social performance (Garcia -Castro, Ariño, & Canela, 2010) , this article focuses on corporate motivations only, not personal ones.", "Thus, the literature on corporate motivations for sustainability present s a multitude of concepts both in the theoretical and field literature. However, lacking a discussion on the intensity of the motives in different geographies and the pace they appear along the time, as more deeply described and analyzed in the Literature Review and the Findings and Propositions sections below. The central gap the present study aims to fulfill regards the lack of a comprehensive model to examine business motivations for engaging in a sustainability agenda, including possible regional and ti ming differences across the planet.", "In the first part of the article, a list of motivations was compiled from the literature. It brings one additional concept that was not included among the other ones previously, that of Social Insurance, which appears as a financial dimension not adequately contemplated by the three other motivations discussed by the authors. The second part of the article derives the propositions and a framework from a comprehensive review of field articles assembled on a systematic s earch on corporate sustainability from different geographies of the world.", "For the operational use of this article the terms “sustainability ” and “sustainable development ” (SD) will be used interchangeably as the latter is the former ’s end goal (Diesendorf, 1999) and as sustainability is commonly used as a short format for SD, especially in composed terms such as ‘corporate sustainability ’. Another operational term of this work is “macro -regions of the world ”. This concept was created and delimited by the United Nations Statistics Division (2012) and comprises six regions: Africa, Asia, Europe, Latin America & the Caribbean, Northern America, and Oceania. Those macro - regions were defined for statistical purposes and follow the continental borders to the maximum (Andel, Bicik, & Bláha, 2018) . However, the UN strived to maintain a distinction between developed versus developing regions along with the borders (United Nations Statistics Division, 2012) , as reported by the academic literature on inequality (Mann & Riley, 2007) . Thus, it is possible to make inferences regarding regional development based on this concept with Africa, Asia, and Latin America/Caribbean as the less developed macro -regions on average. There is significant heterogeneity among and also within these macro -regions; thus, the wor d “average ” must be stressed on the previous sentence. It is, however, not within the scope of the present study to further discuss these differences.", "The next section of this article recalls the creation and evolution of the SD concept and dissects the e xtensive literature on corporate motivation. It also conciliates different views of scholars on the motives for companies to embrace the sustainable development agenda, compiling a list of motivations for corporate sustainability. The Method section explai ns the process used to conduct the review of field articles, necessary to construct the framework. The Findings and Propositions section shows the results of this initial study, develops the propositions, and proposes an encompassing framework. The final s ection brings the Conclusions and Limitations of the present work and points out the gaps that may be further explored by researchers interested in this area of study.", "2.1.2. Literature Review of Corporate Motivations for Sustainability", "The term Sustainable Devel opment was coined in 1987 by the World Commission on Environment and Development, also known as the Brundtland Commission after its Chairperson, Harlem Gro Brundtland, Norway ’s former Prime -Minister. The Commission ’s final report defined sustainable develo pment as development that “meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs ” (UN WCED 1987, p. 16) . This defi nition aimed to go beyond the environment, also contemplating the social and the economic aspects of the development. It later inspired the creation of a global agenda that would go well into the 21st century, responding primarily to the concern of less de veloped countries. The Agenda 21, launched at the Rio de Janeiro 1992 UN Sustainable Development conference, recognized the significant difference in development and investment capacity between the world ’s macro -regions (Mann & Riley, 2007) and addressed the necessary mechanisms to reorient public policy toward SD, combat poverty, improve the use of resources and the management of wastes and chemicals (Meakin, 1992) .", "Since the concept ’s launch, there have been three global Sustainable Development conferences – Rio 1992, Johannesburg 2002, and Rio+20 in 2012. Initially understood as a government -led initiative, Sustainable Development has grown to include every level of society, from individuals to NGOs, from governments to corporations, as it became clearer that sustainability cannot be realized without everyone ’s involvement, in particular that of companies (Benn & Dunphy, 2007; Blindheim & Langhelle, 2010) . Corporations became relevant global players, and without their inclusion in the Sustainable Development efforts this change may not be possible (Pless et al., 2012) .", "But why would companies be motivated to participate in the SD effort? Most of them were created prior to the very conceptualization of Sustainable Development and functioned successfully on a business model that simply did not take it into consideration (Schneider, 2014) . Also, there is no clear consensus on whether sustainable activities can play a positive role toward the financial performance of co mpanies (Garcia -Castro et al., 2010; Marques, Reis, & Gomes, 2018; Orlitzky, Schmidt, & Rynes, 2003) . However, the literature shows increasing involvement with the topic as business leaders accept more and more their companies ’ co-responsibility for finding solutions to the global sustainability is sues and for making Sustainable Development a reality (Epstein & Roy, 2003) . Companies are, therefore, becoming “greener” and adopting a proactive attitude that surpasses legal requirements (Achabou & Dekhili, 2016) , transforming the way they conduct their operations.", "This new role of corporations derived from their own str ength and visibility. It is no longer enough to create jobs and reward investors. They are now required to behave as model, charitable citizens, and to report it to society, as portrayed by Sierra -Garcia, García -Bernal, and Zorio (2013) . Reputation became closely linked to the concept of sustainability (Eberle et al., 2013) . An extensive number of studies around the world have portrayed a positive impact in consumer relations, employee recruitment, government and media treatment, and even company valuation (Martins, Lemme, & Leal, 2015; Orlitzky et al., 2003; Park, Lee, & Kim, 2014; Robinson et al., 2011; Rose & Thomsen, 2004; Saeidi, Sofian, Saeidi, Saeidi, & Saaeidi, 2014; Soleimani, Schneper, & Newburry, 201 4). In the years 2010, corporate motivations for SD were systematized around three main clusters by Windolph et al. (2014) , namely Legitimacy, Market Success, and Process Improvement (Internal Improvement in the original article) based on the work of previous authors (Bansal & Roth, 2000; Darnall, 2003; Epstein, 2008) . In the literature review conducted for this study, a fourth motivation added an angle that did not seem covered by the previous three, namely Social Insurance (Brammer & Pavelin, 2005; P. C. Godfrey, 2005; P. C. Godfrey et al., 2009) . The latter motivation was mostly contained within the business finance literature after being proposed by Paul Godfrey (2005).", "The first concept, Leg itimacy, is widely studied beyond the motivation literature. Legitimacy theory developed from political economy (Deegan, 2002) and focuses on the relationship between corporations and their operating environment in a quest for", "compliance to le gislation or to socially accepted norms. Legitimacy theory operates at a conceptual level and also explains the more recent need for voluntary social disclosure by companies (Laan 2009) . Legitimacy is the corporate ’s response to institutional theory (Barbieri et al., 2010; Meyer & Rowan, 1977) . It is how companies comply to institutions, adapting their practices and discourses to the evolving system of beliefs present in any society (Bitektine, 2011; Bitektine, Lucas, & Schilke, 2016; North, 1990) and have the moral obligation to improve the way they do business (Graafland & van de Ven, 2006) . A concern raised by scholars in CSR is that responsible attitudes are more beneficial to a company if its stakeholders believe that it is more interested in the greater good than in the corporation ’s self -interest (Karaosmanoglu, Altinigne, & Isiksal, 2016 ). Windolph, Harms, and Schaltegger (2014) demonstrate in their research that this attitude may be true for sustainability attitudes as well. A public service broad motivation seems more positively influential among stakeholders, from employees to consu mers to politicians than apparently self -serving motives.", "Market Success refers to the capability of a given company to successfully respond to SD expectations of its business partners. “The behavior of consumers, investors, and competitors can create the motivation to achieve market success through sustainability management ” (Windolph et al. 2014, p. 274) . Innovation is a vital part of continuous success, and SD may be a radical enough c hange to present new opportunities for serving the market and building new business models (Boons et al., 2013; Charter et al., 2008; Hart & Christensen, 2002; Kima, Brodhagb, & Mebratuc, 2014) . The theory of disruptive innovation (Christensen, 1997, 2006) provides the background for constructing successful market strategies derived from such a change.", "Process Improvements are means of delivering a reduction in costs and in using resources. By optimizing processes, companies not only improve their results but can also achieve a more sustainable operation (Bansal & Roth, 2000; Darnall, 2003; Windolph et al., 2014) . Examples are abundant in the business practice, ranging from energy or water rational use to sustainable materia ls in construction to the reuse or recycling of materials (Bansal, 2002) . Certifications such as Leed , awarded by the Green Building Council in different parts of the world (USGBC, 2016) , guide the creation or evolution of office buildings and plants to reach increasing levels of sustainability.", "Finally, Social Insurance prevents poten tial losses in corporate reputations, protecting shareowners against financial distress that could not be insured in regular financial markets and preserving economic value in addition to goodwill from activities that generate value (Brammer & Pavelin , 2005; P. C. Godfrey et al., 2009) . Thus, it is unique in its evident financial self -serving characteristic. It differs from the Legitimacy motivation, which is a positive response to institutional, legislative, or social forces and needs to be perceiv ed as ethical by the public while reputation losses are uncertain and depend on the occurrence of adverse incidents. Preventive social investments help to face crises, mitigating the company ’s involvement in such events (Aßländer, 2013) , as predicted by the Insurance Theory (Brammer & Pavelin, 2005) . Corp orations have come to understand the risk associated with discontented communities and have engaged in activities to minimize the risk of jeopardizing their operations (Trebeck, 2008) . The larger the potential losses, the more incentive companies ha ve to engage and invest in social responsibility and sustainability, going beyond what they would be required to comply to social requirements, regulation or law (Brammer & Pavelin, 200 5; P. C. Godfrey, 2005; P. C.

As a result of the most current literature on the subject, three motivations were used for clusterization by many authors, the fourth one was brought as a contribution from the Finance literature and added as a relevant one for the current study. A bibliometric approach was used to examine a large number of scientific field articles on corporate sustainability and observe which motivations sparked more academic interest in different regions of the world. This article aimed at finding regional differences in corporate motivations for sustainability, thus bibl iometry allowed examining the vast field literature on the subject. The method not only fit the purpose of this study but actually made it possible.", "The term “bibliometry ” was coined in the late 1960s to express “the application of mathematics and statist ical methods to books and other media of communication ” (Pritchard, 1969, p. 349) and gained increasing popularity in different areas of management studies throughout the years (Marques et al., 2018; Teixeira et al., 2013) , especially with the advent of computer programs that allow the treatment of large amounts of data rapidly. During this research, three comp lementary bibliographic approaches were used to treat the data and prepare it for analysis: a database systematic search, a meta - analysis and a social network analysis, as explained throughout this section. The aggregation and analysis of the data allows f or insights that could not have been reached otherwise (Zupic & Čater, 2015) . The 90 papers on the final dataset were also analyzed individually to provide information on the motivations and regions/countries they addressed (Appendix 1). Figure 1 below summarizes the steps for the bibliometric work and the individual analysis of selected papers.", "Figure 1 Methodological steps", "The systematic search of the literature (Creswell, 2014; Kitchenham, 2004; Webster & Watson, 2002) was co nducted using the Scopus Search engine. Scopus was selected because it is one of the leading literature databases with a comprehensive catalog that encompasses several decades while providing enough reliability for academic searches (Ball & Tunger, 2006; Burnham, 2006; Harzing & Alakangas, 2016) and also the flexibility to download both bibliometric (.bib) and individual files. This flexibility proved essen tial to compose this article, which used both traditional and computerized bibliometric analyses. The use of another large database, Web of Science (WoS), was considered to increase the number of field articles for analysis, but previous research showed th at there is a large overlap between the two databases and Scopus is the one that has the largest number of unique articles indexed, particularly in Social Sciences (Mongeon & Paul -Hus, 2016) .", "During the search, a stepwise process (Kitchenham, 2004) was used by adding further keywords to narrow the scope of the articles and reach the most optimized sample within the database researched. After testing different concepts that brought an unmanageable number of articles, the first su ccessful round of search was conducted including as parameters the words “corporate ” and ( “sustainable development ” or “sustainability ”) for a query in titles, abstracts, and keywords. This query resulted in a list of 6,858 documents. The search engine was then limited to articles indexed and with abstracts in English; to sources including journals and conference proceedings (thus excluding books, trade Systematic search of Scopus Database Stepwise approach with multiple keywords and parameters Meta -analysis to reveal trends and regional academic production Further parameters and individual review of papersDataset –90 field articlesIndividual analysis to define motivations and region of interest for each articleSocial Network Analysis (SNA) Development of propositions and a matrix of motivations", "publications, reports, and other formats), and to document types including articles, conference papers an d reviews (excluding book chapters, press articles, short surveys, editorials, and others). These limitations brought the number of papers down to 5,387. No time interval was defined after it proved unnecessary for the proposed search since most of the pap ers were published over the last decade, as seen in the Findings section below. The query included all documents until April 2017.", "The second round of search parameters included the words above plus “motivation ” or “motive ” or “reason ”, as the query aimed to identify motivations for sustainability. The new parameters showed a list of 1,005 documents. To focus on regions, as required for the analysis, the regional parameters were added to a third search “field” or “region ” or “country ” or “territory ”, bringing the results down to 632 documents. “Area ” could not be used because many times it does not refer to geography, but rather to other concepts such as “area of knowledge ” or “measured area ”.", "On those documents, a new limitation of fields of study w as applied since the search interest narrowed on business motivations and not on engineering, arts, computers, or other areas. The fields chosen were business, management, and accounting as per the options provided by the Scopus engine, which resulted in a list of 446 documents. These 446 documents generated a “.bib” file, exported from Scopus to be analyzed using a bibliometric tool aimed at providing landscape information on the growth in the number of studies, most productive countries, and main authors working on this field. The results of this analysis were kept to provide the general background of global research on corporate motivations for sustainability, as shown in the introduction of the next section. A new round of parameters was applied to the 4 46 documents base, with the aim to exclude the papers on human resources -related activities or corporate issues, which focused mostly on employees ’ preparations for sustainable activities, and also the non - peer-reviewed conference papers via the Scopus sea rch engine. For this query, the keywords for exclusion were “Human Resources ” OR hr OR staff OR staffing OR institutional. After this round, 158 papers were left for further analysis. The documents that did not provide the complete information nec essary for the purpose of the present research were discarded, including the ones that were not written in English", "and the ones that lacked data required for the analysis, such as geographic location or unclear treatment of the data regarding underlying mo tivations. With these exclusions, a list of 90 field articles comprised the dataset to be further analyzed both individually and through a bibliographic program designed explicitly for this purpose. Each of them was examined to provide information on the r egion where the research was conducted and the motivation(s) they addressed. The individual papers ’ data was coded in a spreadsheet, allowing the grouping by motivation and by region, which generated the findings and propositions in the next section. Durin g the coding process, no new motivation stood out, and the four categories initially uncovered in the theoretical literature remained as the ones used for analysis.", "After the systematic search, a bibliometric protocol was developed in R studio and first used meta -analysis to examine the “.bib” list file generated by Scopus with the 446 documents and second a social network analysis (SNA) to find the relationships between the motivations and the regions of the world as well as to generate the figures based on data from the final dataset of 90 field articles. Available R packages were used to perform the bibliometric analysis, including Bibliometrix, Dsplr, and Igraph, and additional programming was performed by the authors to extract the required data. Since the quality of the graphs generated by R studio with the protocols used were mostly low -quality ones, the final data was also transferred to a spreadsheet software that allowed for better quality and more flexibility in formatting the graphs.", "2.1.4. Findings", "The number of scientific papers on corporate motivations for Sustainable Development has grown significantly and consistently since the year 2000. The bibliometric findings of the “.bib” file show that business scholars started to take a more in -depth look a t this topic with the new millennium and increasingly produced more and more papers. The first article found was from 1991, but it was an isolated paper in the 1990s. Since 2000 the number of articles published has grown consistently, as seen in Figure 2, confirming previous findings on the growth of academic interested in sustainability and CSR (Aguinis & Glavas, 2012) , bearing in mind that 2017 only included articles for the first four months of that year.", "Figure 2 Field articles on corporate sustainability motivation per year (full year until 2016 and Jan -Apr for 2017)", "Since the concept of Sustainable Development was promulgated by the Brundtland report late in the 1980s (UN WCED, 1987) , it could be expected that corporate implementation would start over the next decade, followed by theoretical studies, as seen in the previous Literature section, and finally by field studies, subsequent to theory. Figure 3 shows the fifteen most academically productive countries about corporate motivations for sustainability. Here, the country ori gin is that of the researchers ’ institutions, as exported to the “.bib” format.", "This figure shows countries from every macro -region, but mostly countries with a large Gross Domestic Product (UK, Australia, Germany, Canada, Spain, Italy …) and/or that are rich in natural resources (USA, Canada, Brazil, Australia, Malaysia, New Zealand…). Other large countries follow immediately after the 15th in number of papers, with China, India, and South Africa producing five articles each. It can be expected that large r and wealthier countries would be the most productive in any given field of study; however, it is important to observe that the most productive countries are scattered around the globe, with every geography of the world represented among the top 20. 1 1 1 2 1 1627 81924393747 477789", "Figure 3 Fifteen most productive countries in number of articles about corporate motivation for sustainability", "In summary, the world experienced an increase in the number of studies on corporate sustainability over the last two decades, and the larger and more affluent countries in each UN macro -region often appeared among the most productive academically. Among the 90 articles selected for in -depth analysis, 34 were global papers, depicting all or most macro -regions; 28 were about Europe; 12 on Asia; 7 on Northern America; 6 on Oceania; 5 on Africa; and only 2 on Latin America. The low number of papers from less developed regions may reflect lower production. Prior studies have identified this gap in Latin America (Ciravegna, Lopez, & Kundu, 2013; Cuervo -Cazu rra & Genc, 2008) , which impairs a deep and balanced analysis of the region. On the other hand, it reveals a theoretical gap that must be pointed out as an opportunity for future studies. The total of articles adds to 94 because some of them focused on two regions and were accounted for both, 2 articles were for Europe and Northern America, 1 for Europe and Oceania and 1 for Latin America and Africa. Appendix 1 summarizes the list of papers classified by macro -region and motivations.", "This dataset provide d valuable information on the most present motivations researched around the world, the growth of academic interest on each of them through time, and the relationships between each macro -region and the motivations’ research. Field research reflects what ha s already been planned or accomplished (Kaplan, 1998) within the companies. So, this article’s propositions and the final framework should not be read as 62", "an in dication of management practice. Still, its findings can provide a guide for future validation in the field.", "The motivations and keywords described in Table 1 in section 2 above were instrumental in classifying each article under one, two, or in one case, three motivations. This article addresses three of the four motivations (Reyers, Gouws, & Blignaut, 2011) and classified case studies under broad motives containing aspects of Legitimacy, Social Insurance, and Process Improvement. Most other papers did no t classify motivations, but the reasoning behind each case described was clear when compared to the definitions of each motivation.", "Figure 4 shows the accumulated total number of articles year after year and makes it clear that studies of every type of mot ivation grew with time, in line with the growth trend seen in Figure 1. Figure 5 depicts the articles published each year by each specific motivation type, revealing the trends in the specific interest per type of motivation.", "Figure 4 Accumulated number of articles by type of motivation Process Improvement Social Insurance Legitimacy Market Sucess", "Figure 5 Number of articles per year by motivation Thus, the motivations stood out with an in -depth analysis of each field paper. Legitimacy was the most prevalent of them, particularly in developing and poorer countries, and some of the papers from Asia and Africa are exemplary in their definitions. Govindan, Kannan, & Shankar (2014) describe how the implementation of CSR in businesses in India depended on government regulations – “…after implementation of ISO 14001, many industries practice environmentally benign manufacturing. If ISO 14001 were not mandatory, this achievement would not be possible” (Govindan et al., 2014, p. 228) . Another study, of the olive oil industry in Tunisia (Achabou, Dekhili, & Hamdoun, 2017) , shows that the implementation of SD practices in developing countries is highly influenced by th e multilateral institutions’ programs, such as the World Bank’s, the participation in global value chains (GVC), and the pressure of regulation and NGOs. In the China textile and apparel industry, researchers (T. Chen et al., 2014) have also found that participation in GVCs, pressure from NGOs and government, and the international markets’ atmosphere were determinant in the development of a code of conduct for the sector. In another article, the quest for Legitimacy was described as the key corporate sustainability motivation in Sub -Saharan Africa (Samy, Ogiri, & Bampton, 2015) . The authors indicate that even though African governments have not yet developed formal policies to promote CSR, most of the countries have the basis for it in their constitutions (i.e., South Africa) or at least view social responsibility as a moral obligation, such as Ghana and Nigeria. 012345678910 Process Improvement Social Insurance Legitimacy Market Sucess", "Other field articles were based on the Market Success motivation, mostly concentrated in Northern America and Europe. Authors recognize that sustainable innovation for competition may be at once an expense burden and a source for continued growth for companies (Hall & Wagner, 2012) , so using SD for marke t differentiation may be more appropriate in developed markets where sophistication can provide increased returns via competition. When analyzing data from two European countries’ manufacturing firms, these authors confirmed that companies “who build their business model on cross - functional problem solving have better economic performance than those who do not” and they also “have a more positive and significant association of their integration with environmental performance” (Hall & Wagner, 2012, p. 193) . Sustainable innovation has also been pointed out as a source of synergistic effect on investment outcome in a large study encomp assing 619 multinational firms listed in the European DJ Stoxx 600 and MSCI indices (Kima et al., 2014) . Another study intended to understand if good environmental practices may have impacted the success in the internationalization of (mostly global) companies based in B razil (Hrdlicka & Kruglianskas, 2010) . Among the conclusions, a better corporate image led to positive differentiation for t he export firms’ operations and products.", "Process Improvement proved to be a long -standing motivation for companies of all sizes with the following examples in the developed markets of Northern America, Europe, and Australia. One article covered eight year s before 2014, investigating two programs that assisted and recommended improvements for small and medium -sized companies (SMEs) in the United States (Kuppig et al., 2016) . Nearly 200 SMEs were assisted during this period, and the most significant motivation both to implement (37%) and not to implement (56%) an SD recommendation was finance -related. More than eight -tenths of these companies expected to improve resource use or to reduce waste, becoming at once more sustainable and more productive. In Europe, a web -based survey encompassed 266 responses from five different countries – Germany, Poland, Serbia, Slovenia, and Spain (Maletič, Maletič, Dahlgaard, Dahlgaard -Park, & Gomišček, 2015) . The evidence suggested that sustainable practices may also improve both financial and non -financial performanc e, mainly through modernization in processes and products. In Australia, a case study of a small -medium enterprise indicated that sustainability is a way to improve companies both in tangible and intangible aspects, leading them to processes that enable a positive “multiple bottom -line” approach (Stewart & Gapp, 2014) .", "The Social Insurance motivation appeared connected to many of the field articles on developing countries’ companies in Africa and Asia, as sum marized in upcoming Figure 6. A review of African practices in CSR (Hamidu et al., 2016) revealed that most companies find that economic responsibility toward oneself and the surrounding society comes first in relation to philanthropy or even legal and ethical obligations. According to the authors, by picking a need that covers a government g ap, the company intends to foster loyalty from the community where it operates, thus insuring itself from future issues. The same is true for the global mining industry, which often operates in the poorer regions of the world, “side -by-side with indigenous people” (Jenkins & Yakovleva, 2006, p. 272) . This Global Paper defines the con text for an SD mining operation and the imperative need companies face to engage with autochthonous groups in order to keep them sufficiently pleased not to reach out for social movements and NGOs that might oppose the work of these transnational corporati ons, thus increasing the costs associated to their business.", "But the Social Insurance motivation affects developed markets as well, sometimes by happenings in less privileged areas of the world. A case study developed in Scandinavia reports how the 1990s child labor crisis and other global issues of poorer countries in Asia, Africa or Latin America affected the operation of a large low -cost fashion manufacturer from the Northern European region (Lueg, Pedersen, & Clemmensen, 2015) . The fashion group positioned its sustainability program to ensure the protection of shareholders against downside risk, rather than for altruism or to attract more consumers, by transferring responsibility to its suppliers via a code of conduct. The regional -specific research interests are evident when narrowing at each of the macro - regions. Figure 6 shows the number of motivations per region. Some of the papers analyzed revealed more than a single motivation.", "Figure 6 Motivations by UN macro -region Figure 7 is a relationship map between regions a nd motivations, The larger the balloon, the larger the number of articles produced in that region or about that topic. The lines between the balloons represent the relationships between them.", "Figure 7 Relationship map between motivations and macro -regions IMP = Process Improvement, INS = Social Insurance, LEG = Legitimacy, MKT = Market Success AF = Africa, AS = Asia, EU = Europe, GP = Global Papers, LA = Latin America/Caribbean, NA = North America, OC = Oceania 1080129 AFRICAASIAEUROPELATIN AMERICANORTH AMERICAOCEANIAGLOBAL PAPERS Process Improvement Social Insurance Legitimacy Market Success", "Europe is the macro -region that concentrated most of the field articles on motivations for corporate sustainability. It is also where Market Success appeared as the main motivation for research, closely followed by Legitimacy. In Northern America, these two motivations were close to a ti e. In Asia and Africa, Legitimacy dominated, but in Asia, Market Success came second and Social Insurance third, while in Africa, Social Insurance came at a strong second. Oceania had a concentration on Legitimacy. Latin America only appeared with two excl usive articles, one on Market Success and the other on Legitimacy. The articles that focused on several geographies, called Global Papers, were distributed among all four motivations, but more concentrated on Legitimacy and with Social Insurance last.", "2.1.5. Discussion and Propositions", "As forecasted in literature and confirmed by the field papers, the earliest and most prevalent researched motivation is that of Legitimacy (Bansal & Roth, 2000; Epstein & Buhovac, 2014; Windolph et al., 2014) . Process Improvement appeared as an early motivation as well. Social insurance appeared as stable through time. Market Success looks like an ever -growing motivation, ranking number two in the accumulated number of articles, 30 compared to 41 on Legitimacy, and even surpassing the latter in specific years. Thus, the data al lows inferring the following propositions for future validation: Proposition 1 – Motivations for corporate sustainability change over time, reflecting societal changes and interest groups involved.", "Proposition 2 – Early motivations for corporate sustainabi lity derived from compliance to institutions. Later motivations also relate to competition and differentiation. It does seem from the field studies that companies are initially motivated to become more sustainable due to legislation and the overall complia nce to the institutional environment, in line with the literature’s predictions (Windolph et al., 2014) . As depicted in this article’s Introduction, the very concept of Sustainable Development was born under the auspices of governments an d multilateral organizations such as the UN and later nurtured by the NGOs. Regulation and compliance have been the historical common ground for all companies as organizations, administrations, and national -institutional arrangements set the SD boundaries for global capitalism (Fransen, 2013) . Over time, however,", "companies find that the lack of sustainable practices may become a competitive disadvantage (Hoepner, Oikonomou, Scholtens, & Schröder, 2016) while innovation and improvements that derive from SD may foster their market position, possibly influencing them even to rethink their end goals beyond profit and into social and environmental arenas (Schneider, 2014) . Also, in line with the Literature Review analysis in this article, summarized by the keywords in Table 1 , this brings new stakeholders, such as clients and consumers, into the companies’ considerations, motivating them for changes beyond the ones required by pressure groups or governments.", "Beyond the timing considerations of corporate sustainability motivations, different macro -regions of the world seemed more skewed to specific motivations given local needs and stage of development. As mentioned in the Fi ndings section, Legitimacy appeared as a concern in every region. Other motivations were more prevalent in specific ones. More developed economies where depicted in studies showing Market Success as a strong motivation for companies, since a larger number of competitors in a market make innovation and differentiation a competitive advantage. In Europe, for instance, a study of the banking industry linked corporate social performance to financial performance, advocating for a new way to evaluate risk and, th us, credit availability (Stellner et al., 2015) . Process Improvement appeared in every macro -region except Asia, as a basic but not as a prominent motivatio n. Finally, the Social Insurance motivation research was more relevant in Africa and Asia, that house many developing economies. In the case of Africa, the small role of the national states in social provisioning forced corporations to get involved beyond their externalities and in issues such as poverty reduction (Aaron, 2012) , which helped them to prevent a crisis. On the other hand, The Findings lead to the propositions for future research below.", "Proposition 3 – Motivations vary by macro -region based both on socio -economic development and on regional legitimation needs.", "Proposition 4 – The more sophisticated a market becomes, the more corporate motivations for sustainabi lity go beyond legitimation and into innovations that may support incremental business results.", "The more sophisticated the consumers, the more sophisticated the market, meaning that their choices allow for ethical considerations that would not be present o therwise (Titus", "& Bradford, 1996) . Innovations are as diverse as the industries, so each field article describes a different internal process, as forecasted in the literature (Boons et al., 2013; Kima et al., 2014; Maletič et al., 2015) . However, they all share the same motivation for an improved operation and increased results. The regional variations captured on Proposition 3 also reflect the companies’ changing motivations as markets evolve to reward companies with better governance (Soleimani et al., 2014) and according to national -institutional arrangements (Fransen, 2013) . Thus, their motivation to implement a particular SD strategy may vary according to the geographies where the corporation does business.", "As in the case of Social Insurance, more or less developed economies require a different sustainability strategy (Boo ns et al., 2013) . The other motivations also vary accordingly: Legitimacy may mean different conditions in different societies, as it depends on social judgment (Bitektine, 2011) ; consumer perceptions will define the strategies necessary for a company’s Market Success (Öberseder, Schlege lmilch, & Murphy, 2013) ; and legislation, as well as competition and other market conditions, will impact the implementation of Process Improvements.", "The findings also indicate that both timing and regional considerations play a defining role in corpora te motivation for sustainability. Apparently, Legitimacy and Process Improvement tend to be early motivations, while Market Success and Social Insurance appear as later ones. Since the former two tend to be a case -by-case response to institutions (Bitektine et al., 2016) or to legislation, they may be implemented initially as obligations. The latter tw o, however, may appear as choices for growth or market differentiation (Boons et al., 2013) or for managing risk (Epst ein & Roy, 2003) in order to protect a company’s tangible or intangible assets.", "Similarly, differences in the level of development and market sophistication of each macro -region seemed to play a role in the corporate motivations for sustainability. Mark et Success appeared more often in regions that have a higher level of competition, while Social Insurance seemed like a motivation more often connected to developing regions. This suggests two new propositions related to the changing academic interest on c orporate motivation by region and development:", "Proposition 5 – Independent of its national origin, a company’s motivations for sustainability in its international operations are aligned to the development level of each market it serves.", "Proposition 6 – As a macro -region, or country within it, changes its development level, so shall the companies’ motivations for sustainability in this market change as well. These are complementary propositions, as both look at necessary adjustments to different market condi tions, one concerned with implementation and the other with adaptation through time. Future field studies on Proposition 5 may profit and expand from work already developed in the area of transnational companies’ SD (Achabou et al., 2017; Escobar & Vredenburg, 2011; Soleimani et al., 2014; Surroca et al., 2013) which show that the integration within each market a corporation serves depends on strategic alignment to local conditions and expectations. Co ncerning proposition 6, the changes in motivation have also been described partly in the longitudinal data study of companies by Bansal and Roth (2000) . Further longitudinal studies may provide more evidence of this matter. As the topic of sustainability is a relatively recent concern of companies, changes in development l evel and their impact on corporate motivation for SD hasn’t yet been described significantly in field studies. But this adjustment in strategy may be expected for the same reason that companies adjust due to geographic considerations or other changing cond itions.", "The findings based on field research and the subsequent propositions inspired the creation of a framework that may be operationalized in future studies of corporate motivation for sustainability in different geographies of the world. An important p iece of this framework is the external environment. External pressures and conditions must be understood as a background to the motivations and shall be examined in each specific situation. All together, these conditions lead to the framework proposed in F igure 8 below.", "Figure 8 Framework of Corporate Motivations for Sustainability As per the six previous propositions, the corporate motivations for sustainability should move according to two main axes: one of time or experience and one related to the sophistication or competitiveness of the market. Thus, this framework proposes that the longer the topic of sustainable development has been a concern for a society, the more companies will move from adjusting its procedures to regulations (Legitimacy) and internal opportunities (Process Improvement) to searching for innovations that will increase their market presence, be it to prevent unforeseen incidents (Social Insurance) or to gain share (Market Success). At the same time, as their market matures and the consumers become more sophisticated, innovations turn out to be vital for competi ng both from a cost (Process Improvement) and a differentiation (Market Success) point of view. Figure 9 on the next page intends to condense the motivations, articles, findings, and the propositions presented in the current article. The framework has a t ridimensional quality that needs further clarification, showcased in this figure. The field and theory articles presented in section 4 are at the center of this summary because they are the instrument that connected the motivations, the main findings (time and development considerations), and the six propositions. On the motivation side, the articles were the ones that exemplified how the motives worked at field research. On the findings side, they were mostly theoretical papers. Together with the findings of timing, going from earlier to later motivations, and development, from less to more sophisticated markets, allowed the inference of the propositions as demonstrated throughout the article.", "Figure 9 Summary of motivations, articles, findings, and propositions", "2.1.6. Contributions, Limitations, and Future Studies", "This article led to propositions and a conceptual framework of corporate motivations for sustainability across different macro -regions of the world and along the time. Previous studies of corporate motivation for sustainability focused on up to three external reasons, namely Legitimacy, Process Improvement, and Market Success, as different areas within Business Administrati on narrowed their discussions into their specific interest. This article proposes the inclusion of a fourth motivation, Social Insurance, used previously in the Finance literature as an initial contribution.", "This study’s second contribution is to present findings and develop propositions derived from analyzing field articles concerning the four motivations. Two propositions focus on the time changes on corporate motivation for sustainability research, three propositions focus on the regional differences fo und in field articles on development and sophistication of the markets, and the final proposition depends on both time and development considerations.", "The main contribution of this article is to create a framework that encompasses the motivations, the find ings behind the field articles examined, and the propositions derived by them. This framework concentrates the findings, including the timing and regional development considerations, and may improve the academic knowledge about corporate motivations for su stainability by geography. The framework may be applied by scholars in field work to assess motivations at different locations, hopefully contributing to form a global blueprint of why companies engage in SD and how the engagement turns into strategy diffe rently.", "This research may be beneficial for practitioners as well, as it may support the development of a geographic -based corporate SD strategy. The framework can be used as a tool for managers developing a global corporate sustainability strategy. It ma y provide insights on the underlying motives for sustainability in each of the regions where a company operates and support business executives in decisions to engage in programs more suited to address these motivations. There may also be social implicatio ns for the use of this framework by pressure groups, individuals, or NGOs, which can be assessed in additional studies.", "Bibliometric methods were used in this study both to enable the review of a large amount of data and to improve the validity and reliabi lity of the findings, as these methods tend to enhance the rigor on the otherwise subjective evaluation of the researcher (Sinkovics, Penz, & Ghauri, 2008; Zupic & Čater, 2015) . The methodology was meant to be public from the start and the full description of the steps aimed at increasing reliability and allowing readers to asses possible applicability to similar or different contexts (Creswell Thus, future studies wil l be important to validate and expand the information on this topic as the present study faced several limitations. One limitation was the choice of field articles, which relied on the Scopus Search Engine, widely used and respected in academic studies (Burnham, 2006; Mongeon & Paul -Hus, 2016) , but naturally unable of indexing the totality of articles globally. The keywords selected may have significantly impacted the number of articles available for analysis. When defining the regional consideration w ith the words “country OR field OR territory” it is possible that articles that only cited country names or regions were excluded.", "An additional limitation was the reduced number of studies depicting developing regions, which may be derived from the smalle r scientific production in these areas of the world as described by statistical research (Davis, 2014; NSB, 2018) . For instance, in the case of Latin America and the Caribbean, which is a relatively little studied region (Ciravegna et al., 2013; Cuervo -Cazurra & Genc, 2008) , only two articles passed the entire stepwise process to become part of the final 90 articles analyzed. Only papers written in English were considered, which may also have limited the number of papers from these regions. The analysis of each one of the articles also indicated that there is a small number of cases describing individual company motivations. It is a nascent field of study that may profit from the increasing availability of corporate documentation requested by NGOs, regulatory agencies, compliance officers, and other stakeholders (Laan, 2009) .

Findings – The case confirms literature indications of evolution in sustainability from compliance to differentiation.

This one examines a company that achieved global significance due to its sustainability strategy. Also, beyond literature, leadership proved crucial in the process.", "2.2.1. Introduction", "Sustainability was initially viewed as a responsibility of governments since this concept's complexity was not the focus of the profit -oriented corporations (Schneider, 2014) . The United Nations Organization has led the sustainabili ty discussions, defining the idea of Sustainable Development (UN WCED, 1987) , issuing reports and platforms (UN and KPMG, 2016; United Nations Organization, 2015) , and promoting conferences for five decades (Meakin, 1992; Sohn, 1973; UN Global Compact, 2012; United Nations Organization, 1992) .", "However, corporations became such relevant global players that they must be part of the global sustainability efforts (Pless et al., 2012) . Responsibilities were slowly shared with companies and individuals as they became pivotal to advance this agenda (Diesendorf, 1999; Schneider, 2014) . The new engagement requires def iance to conventional practices, structural changes, and sometimes additional costs and investments (Boons et al., 2013) . Therefore, corporate sustainability may strike as a burden to a company. Understanding a Consumer Goods Company’s (CGC) motivations to engage in the sustainability agenda and how the concept is translated into action through time are the primary purposes of this study. Two main hypotheses were formulated from the literature presented in the next", "section, Conceptual Review. First, corpo rate sustainability motivations change over time, especially evolving from compliance to legislation and institutions (Fransen, 2013; Windolph et al., 2014) to also achieve innovation and differentiation for competitive advantage (Hoepner et al., 2016; Schneider, 2014) . Second, the same movement happens along with the increased sophistication of stakeholders, particularly consumers, whose choices allow for ethical considerations in their purchase behavior as they become more affluent (Titus & Bradford, 1996) . Each industry will respond with different innovation models (Boons et al., 2013; Kima et al., 2014; Maletič et al., 2015) to attain better operations and results in response to stak eholders’ demands.", "In this study, a consumer goods multinational corporation (CG -MNC) recognized by its Sustainable Development (SD) practice is assessed based on a corporate motivations for sustainability model derived from different scholars' research (Bansal & Roth, 2000; Brammer & Pavelin, 2005; Darnall, 2003; Epstein, 2008; P. C. Godfrey, 2005; P. C. Godfrey et al., 2009; Windolph et al., 2014) . The corporation at the center of this analysis is Brazil -based Natura &Co, which manag es four global cosmetic companies – Natura, Aesop, The Body Shop, and Avon. Like most emerging market MNCs, Natura &Co only recently became a significant international business (Kogut & de Mello, 2018; Nair, Demirbag, & Mellahi, 2015) . The acquisition of Avon was completed in January 2020 (Natura &Co, 2020a) . This case describes growth limitations and competitive innovations in the trajectory to become a global business with an aura of sustainability. The main findings relate to the corporation's perceived sustainability ethic, pur sued by its leadership, that allowed for global expansion.", "This study adds academic knowledge to the relatively little -studied Latin America region (Ciravegna et al., 2013; Cuervo -Cazurra & Genc, 2008) . It also adds to cases previously published about Natura &Co. Earlier sustainab ility studies and reports focused on different aspects, including product (Dalmarco, Hamza, & Aoqui, 2015; Vilh a & Quadros, 2006) and supply chain development (Francke & Castro, 2013; Le Tourneau & Greissing, 2010; Veiga, 2013) , internationalization (Sutter, MacLennan, Fernandes, & de Oliveira Jr., 2015; Zilber, Mora Jr, & Lourenço da Silva, 2010) , and business strategy (Isaac, Conti, Ghobril, Netto, & Tucci Jr, 2017; Lombardi, Leal, & Basso, 2010) . The present study focuses on corporate sus tainability engagement, and results suggest that it is a tool for competitive advantage.", "2.2.2. Conceptual Review", "This paper uses Diesendorf's (1999) working definition of sustainability as a short format for Sustainable Development, especially in composed terms, such as 'corporate sustainability' or 'sustainability ethics.' Ethics, or ethos, is understood as \"the systematic and structured development of criteria for evaluating moral action\" (Oermann and When the concept of SD was adopted in the 1990 s, it seemed opposite to managerial practice (Luke, 2013) , and business cases acted against sustainability (Schaltegger & Burritt, 2018) . Nonetheless, the sustainability concept's influence increased significantly, turning it a core element of both government and international organizatio ns' policies (Mebratu, 1998) . The SD definition by the UN's Brundtland Report (UN WCED, 1987) made sustainability more palatable for business, with the economics regarded at the same level of importance as the social and the environmental agendas, the so -called Triple Bottom Line, or TBL (Elkington, 2004) .", "As businesspeople accepted more responsibility for finding solutions to sustainability issues (Epstein & Roy, 2003) , it ended up provoking innovations in goods and services (Kima et al., 2014) . Many companies adopt a proactive attitude that surpasses legal requirements (Achabou & Dekhili, 2016) , transforming the way they operate (Boons et al., 2013; Maletič et al., 2015) and growing through “greener” differentiation (Pucci, Casprini, Matt iacci, & Zanni, 2019) . However, the design of such a comprehensive company's SD plan depends on its managers' beliefs (Schaltegger & Burritt, 2018) . Windolph et al. (2014) excluded the effect of companies' leaders' decisions to focus on corporate motivations relevant to any busin ess. The authors (Windolph et al., 2014) devised broad motivation categories named Legitimacy, Market Success, and Internal Improvement, adding to previous literature (Bansal & Roth, 2000; Darnall, 2003; Epstein, 2008) . A fourth motivation, described in the business finance literature and proposed by Paul Godfrey (2005), brings an angle that does not seem covered by the previous three, namely Social Insurance (Brammer & Pavelin, 2005; P. C. Godfrey, 2005; P. C. Godfrey", "Legitimacy is the need to adapt discourse and values to society's evolving beliefs (Bitektine, 2011; Bitektine et al., 2016) . It stands as the corporate response to institutional theory (Barbieri et al., 2010; Meyer & Rowan, 1977) and should appear more altruistic than self-serving to benefit a company. Market Success is achieving better results through SD management (Windolph et al., 2014) . It may include innovation and differentiation in products and services (Christensen, 1997, 2006) , and assessing unforeseen opportunities to serve the market and create new business models (Boons et al., 2013; Charter et al., 2008; Hart & Christensen, 2002; Kima et al., 2014) . Internal Improvement relates to processes, cost, and resources’ optimization, ensuring more sustainable operations (Bansal & Roth, 2000; Darnall, 2003; Windolph et al., 2014) . Social Insurance is protection against losses in reputation that cannot be regularly insured in the market, preventing financial distress and building goodwill (Brammer & Pavelin, 2005; P. C. Godfrey et al., 2009) . This protection may be visibly self-serving to the company as long as it benefits communities and minimizes risks (Aßländer, 2013; Trebeck, 2008) . These motivations for corporate SD may appear in different m oments of a company's lifecycle and achieve different levels of importance in different cultures and locations.", "2.2.3. Research Questions and Methodology", "This research opted for a case study method (Yin, 2009) to assess the literature's empirical adherence and generate further reflections. The un it of analysis (Yin, 2009) is the company. All information collected was triangulated for improved validity (Creswell & Miller, 2000) with different information sources, including company reports, investor reports, journal articles, media articles, observation notes, and interviews with current an d former Natura &Co’s executives and sustainability experts. These contrasting sources, including critical views, add confidence to the study's findings (Creswell, 2014; Järvensivu & Törnroos, 2010) .", "The literature led the initial hypotheses to be operational ized into questions for data collection and analysis: What initially motivates a multinational CGC to engage in a sustainability agenda? How does it change over time? Is there a shift from a legitimacy focus into competition and differentiation? How strong ly stakeholders influence the company’s engagement?", "The definition of the appropriate case to answer the research questions followed a sampling approach with SD -engaged corporations. The Global Compact, a pact to promote voluntary sustainability commitment s, was the initial tool to search for companies (UN Global Compact, 2019) . Among those, Consumer Goods Companies were selected, as they tend to be more sensitive to public concerns (D. L. Brown, Vetterlein, & Roemer -Mahler, 2010) .

When Natura was founded, cosmetics companies r elied on the chemical industry to develop their products. Seabra decided to use natural resources and traditional knowledge to develop a chemical -substitute product line (Former CEO, personal communication, July 29, 2019).", "Natura's current CEO said it was a decision based not only on principles but also on budget. The small new business in Brazil did not have the resources to hire global chemical companies, so decided to explore the natural resources of a country reputed for the world’s most abundant biodiv ersity (Pilon et al. , 2017) . This initial approach", "supported the company's christening – Natura, a brand that carried a promise from its own name.", "Review of motivations The company’s Legitimacy has relied on this promise. Executives and external sources state that the decision to adopt the “natural” claim allowed the company to explore a marketing differential scarcely explored in 1969 and over the next 20 years (personal communication, August 1 9, 2019). The VP of Marketing, Innovation and Sustainability (MIS), the former and the current directors of Corporate Affairs, and the Sustainability manager emphasize the need to maintain legitimation. The last one highlighted that brand indicators show t hat “sustainability generates reputation, which generates confidence, that generates purchases.” They agree that Legitimacy is not a significant issue today, as Natura built a strong natural image through time. Nevertheless, it must respond to society's co ntinually changing demands (Bitektine et al., 2016) . “Natura always did [sustainability] and never spoke about it. In the last few years, we could not silence. As there is much ‘greenwashing’ (…), being silent started to become a burden to us,” said the MIS VP.", "At Natura &Co, the SDGs are viewed as a roadmap (Former CEO, personal communication, July 2 9, 2019), but the sustainability strategy precedes them and should not change unless the SDGs contradict specific elements (CEO, personal communication, July 16, 2019). Confirming Fransen (2013) , all co rporate interviewees believe that implementing a global sustainability agenda depends on adapting to local institutional arrangements. Legitimacy relies on adaptable consistency.", "More attention seems to be drawn toward Market Success . It was the most debat ed topic in the interviews and repeatedly appeared in media and scientific articles. The company pursued sustainable product development and innovation (Dalmarco et al., 2015; Lombardi et al., 2010) based on its country of origin nature’s halo (Sutter et al., 2015) . According to Zilber et al. (2010) , Natura’s internationalization process followed a learning model, acquiring new competencies in new markets but retain ing the differentiation provided by its Brazilian biodiversity line of products.", "Natura &Co executives believe that this marketing differential gave the company the stature to acquire well -established international brands. However, not a big enough compet itive advantage to position the Natura brand in developed markets. Both the company’s former CEO and the New Market’s Strategy Manager agree that the global presence depended on acquiring businesses with established value chains and brand recognition.", "But the sustainability credentials allowed Natura to innovate in packaging, the topic most cited under Internal Improvement . Other cosmetics companies are still reluctant to sell refills or reuse or recycle packages, given the “glamourous” materials and shapes used to distinguish the brands (Former CEO and Sustainability Manager, personal communication, July 15 and 7, 2019). Natura became the first cosmetics company in the world to launch refillable packages back in 1983 (MIS VP, personal communication, August 14, 2019), to pioneer sustainable consumption with the launch of the Sou line in 2013 (Dalmarco et al., 2015) , and t o use 100% recycled plastic and 30% recycled glass in different lines of products (Sustainability Manager, personal communication, August However, Natura's attempts are insufficient for some of the company's stakeholders, indicating the need for further radical change in the future. Akatu’s president, Dr. Mattar, states that some of the company's processes and products are far from being sustainable, primarily due to packaging. He praises the Sou line of products for its 70% reduction in the use of raw materials. Still, he believes that the water in this and every other line should be concentrated, saving more in packaging and transportation. Another specific criticism is related to refills, which still use too much material and are sold in small bags instead of larger ones, producing significant amounts of non -recyclable waste (Helio Mattar, personal communication, July 7, 2019).", "Even so, most of the TBL’s vertices of environment and economy have been addressed throughout Natura’s history. The so cial pillar seems to lack an equally consistent agenda (Sustainability Manager, personal communication, August 7, 2019). Natura is refocusing its value chain toward Social Insurance . Investments in potentially harmful areas increasingly become part of Natu ra’s SD strategy. In the Amazon, harvesting of bio ingredients for the company’s goods turned into its landmark case of community", "engagement, growing the extractive activity in a protected area (Le Tourneau & Greissing, 2010) .", "The former CEO said that the company built a plant in the State of Pará with the dual purpose of improving the soap pro duction’s sustainability and the quality of life of families that supplied oil for the production. Also, the communities surrounding Natura’s offices benefit from social investments, while direct sellers are involved with a program that generates resources for education (Sustainability Manager, personal communication, August 7, 2019). This program transfers all the profits of one product line (“Believe to See” in free translation) to educational projects; both the direct sellers and Natura give away their g ains.", "Sustainable Leadership Appeal However, these motivations do not fully explain Natura’s encompassing SD agenda. Interviewees believe that the concept was present in Natura long before the UN coined the concept. Both the current and former CEOs view th e founders' influence in the creation of a corporate ethos. Luiz Seabra would be the one that brought the human and the \"natural\" appeals; Guilherme Leal deepened the social dimension and unified the corporate sustainability concept; and Pedro Passos defen ded the sector’s regulations within associations and with the government. The younger professionals repute Leal as the most active defender of sustainability, probably because of his visibility at the well - known (in Brazil) Ethos Institute for corporate re sponsibility and as a former Vice - Presidential candidate. In any case, executives are unanimous stating that the external pressure toward sustainability was weaker than the internal one, and Natura has usually been ahead of the market.", "The three founders a re vocal in the media about their commitment to SD. Seabra says that he always aimed to implement a culture of what is now known as the TBL (Blecher, 2013) . Guilherme Leal led the creation of a corporate sustainability guide at Ethos Institute and was the running mate at the env ironmentalist Marina Silva’s presidential candidacy. He states that “business can be a force for good” (Schipani, 2019) . Pedro Passos co -chairs the environment NGO SOS Mata Atlantica and founded the Instituto Semeia for parks’ protection. Passos believes that the sustainable business movement is irreversible regardless of governments’ actions (IstoÉ Dinheiro, 2019) .", "Executives in different areas and levels replicate the founders’ views. Natura’s MIS VP said that it is impossible to work at Natura without ab sorbing its ethos. For her, the instruments for sustainability range from strict HR policies to approving committees in every project. The most striking policy for all corporate interviewees was the inclusion of SD targets in the compensation system. The C EO speaks about the “famous case of 2011 when Natura reached its economic target but distributed zero bonus because it did not reach the socio -economic objective.” Natura’s annual reports, since 2009, expressed the obligation of achieving TBL targets. The social objective lost in 2011 canceled variable compensation payments, leading to employee dissatisfaction (Sendin, 2013) . The company publicized the decision in its 2011 Annual Report (Natura &Co, 2012) . Although traumatic, a branding professional wrote in his blog that this was a most effective culture management decision (Guimarães, 2019) in favor of corporate sustainability. Since then, those targets were achieved year after year. Issues from business choices The promise of brand Natura turned into a biding, at times costly, commitment, for the company too. The Sustainability Communications manager exemplifies with the organic alcohol value chain development, as \"millions [were invested] in this agenda for a lo ng time\" to reduce the company's carbon footprint. Natura announced in 2006 that it would only use organic alcohol in all formulations. However, there was no supply chain in place, and Natura had higher costs while investing in developing suppliers and log istics for the product (MIS VP, personal communication, August 14, 2019).", "Most other executives illustrated how the commitment to sustainability impacted the reputation or financial results negatively at some point. In product development, each project mu st comply with sustainability standards to be approved. According to the New Markets Strategy manager, the standards for sustainability delayed many of the company's projects and made them more costly or less attractive – “Sometimes the packaging may seem less upscale than other brands', but if you can reuse and refill it, the consumer will look at the product with new eyes.” He credits the founders for the strict guidelines.", "However, these guidelines seem to be more skewed toward environmental than social sustainability. Internally too, social sustainability appears to be an area of needed", "development. African -Brazilians are not visible among the corporation's top ranks, although ethnic diversity is observed around the facilities (personal communication, August 17, 2019). In conversations, sexual orientation diversity seems natural to employees, but it is scarcely mentioned in official documents. There is just one mention in the 2019 Annual Report, referring to the LGBT+ internal support group at The Body Shop (Natura &Co 2020b, p. 49) . Other minorities are addressed in the Annual Report (people with disabilities, indigenous communities) but not visible in the company’s offices (personal communication, August 17, 2019). Gender diversity is apparent at a ll levels. A previous study on diversity among large companies in Brazil ranks Natura as the one with the largest majority of women in critical roles (Proni & Proni, 2018) . However, the company’s Board of Directors a nd global committees are still vastly masculine (Natura &Co, 2020c) .", "The previous CEO said that it is difficult to live up to the high expectations. For him, “one must deal and recognize one’s incoherence while showing the path to impr ove.” He cited the launch of the environment -friendly Ekos line of products in 2000. The company realized that it had no tracking for six naturally sourced ingredients. He claims to have exposed it to the public with the promise to fix the issue within two years. The Ekos line faced additional problems when the Brazilian government issued a decree against biopiracy. In 2009, the company was formally accused of stealing traditional knowledge from an indigenous Amazonian tribe, as reported by the media (Azev edo, 2009) . The decree aimed at combating international biodiversity exploitation but also affected domestic companies. Natura advocated for a new law to control biodiversity and lobbied in Congress. “We faced fines, discussions, and the redrafting of t he Brazilian frame to ensure that the biodiversity assets’ use was allowed (…). It took ten years to build new legislation”, said the director of Corporate Affairs.", "The charges against Natura were dropped in 2013 at court and covered by the press (Folha de S.Paulo, 2013; Meio & Mensagem, 2013) . However, the story remained a negative reference, with media doubting that the new legislation had been passed in the country’s best interest (Schreiber, 2015) .", "This issue was the most visible one against Natura’s sus tainable aura. Despite the mostly favorable news media coverage, Natura faces criticism from time to time, especially when", "it does not live up to its environmental credentials (Azevedo, 2009; G1, 2019; Rossi, 2014) or transparency (Brasil 247, 2016) .", "The competitive advantage Natura &Co leaders consider that its costlier choices have rewarded the company. \"We believe th at sustainability is competitive advantage; it is our way of getting things done,\" said the CEO. For him, the intangible value gained much surpasses the costs as consumers and investors are willing to pay a premium for the Natura &Co brands. The integratio n of sustainability beliefs into strategy formulation seems to increase performance and results (Borrero, Acosta, & Medina, 2020) .", "The former head of Government and Corporate Relations agrees with him – \"sustainability has always been an attribute of the Natura brand,\" one of the characteristics that made the brand aspirational. The VP of MIS thinks it must become an even more central attribute in brand communication or lose its competitive advantage. Beyond communication, the director of Corporate Affairs said that the use of biodiversity assets dep ends on nature's time but brings more diversity and innovation. He says that this tardiness is Natura’s right pace and its way of doing things.", "2.2.5. Discussion", "The acceptance of this slower pace seems part of Natura &Co’s strategy. It positioned the company to become a global player as agreed by scholars (Dalmarco et al. , 2015; Francke and Castro, 2013) , media (IstoÉ Dinheiro, 2019; Williams, 2016) , and interviewees. The company's reputation grows in line with the institutionalization of SD as a socially accepted concept (Barbieri et al. , 2010 . Dr. Thomas Lovejoy agrees that Natura &Co \"was about sustainability from the very beginning (…). The corporate ethos is really quite impressive and sets an example around the world.\" Today, it appears skewed toward the Market Success and Social Insurance motivations. The other two motivations seem embedded in the Company's operation from the start – Legitimacy and Internal Improvement. Natura &Co moved through time from legitimation to competitive advantage (Isaac et al., 2017) , especially innovating in product development and technology (Vilha & Quadros, 2006) and expanding", "community involvement (Le Tourneau & Greissing, 2010) . However, social inclusion remains an underdeveloped area. Natura’s executives recognized that it should focus more on social aspects and on improving workforce diversity.", "The four sustainability motivations excluded the leadership factor (Windolph et al., 2014) , preventing individual behavior differences. However, the leadership values are intertwined with the company's motivations. S enior executives are the key contributors to an environment favoring corporate sustainability (Lampikoski, Westerlund, Rajala, & Moller, 2014) . In Natura's case, founders adopted a sustainability ethic that seems to permeate the whole organization.", "Leadership and the business case appear as the primary internal drivers for organizational change (Lozano, 2015) . Natura &Co's sustainability principles c ome from the top of the organization and back management to respond with innovative sustainable solutions, mostly radical and oriented to the future (Charter et al., 2008) . Natura &Co faced several innovation challenges successfully, such as the described creation of organic ethanol supply, the challenge of natural sourcing (Veiga, 2013) , and low impact production requirements (Francke & Castro, 2013) .", "Natura &Co seems ahead in the SD agenda when stakeholders increasingly reward more sustainable companies, especially in the cosmetics sector (Isaac et al., 2017) . This case confirms the need to go beyond processes and eco-innovation to become a sustainable company (Boons et al., 2013) . Natura followed the environmental path but anticipated the need to expand to a TBL agenda to achieve competitive advantage. Organ izations that can turn the TBL into market advantage may ensure long-term value growth (Epstein & Roy, 2003) . Institu tional investors increasingly side NGOs in recognizing the risks of mismanaging sustainability. Blackrock’s Chairman, one of the world's largest investment groups, warned corporations that they must raise their sustainability bar or be left out (Fink, 2019) .", "Dr. Mattar cautio ns, however, that companies are still far from the level of sustainability necessary to the challenges the world faces – “if escalated, the multinationals’ business model will bring disaster in 12 years (…) as they are not working toward the actual", "sustain ability challenge.” He praised some of Natura &Co’s activities but said the company must undergo further change to face such challenges.", "On revenue, Natura has seen continuous growth in sales during its five decades of operation. Between 2015 and 2020, the stock price has grown threefold, and the market believes Natura &Co will keep the growth for the foreseeable future (Terlep, 2020) . The New Markets Strategy manager said that the company would be able to speed up its global presence for the foreseeable future with the international acquisitions. The positive image generated by Natura’s image and growing revenues may maintain low external pressures.", "2.2.6. Conclusion", "This study lands the theoretical discussion about corporate sustainability motivation s and engagement on a case of a global company renowne d for its sustainable operation. Four questions operationalized the hypotheses that emerged from the literature – why engage in an SD agenda? What changes over time? Do the motivations shift from legitimation to competition? How strongly stakeholders influ ence this engagement?", "Natura & Co's case indicates that it engaged with sustainability early in its lifecycle, mostly due to its founders' values and the impracticality of competing with the chemical - based international cosmetics companies. Natura soon le arned how to positively use the “made -in” effect of being based in Brazil (Isaac et al., 2017; Sutter et al., 2015) , recognized by its vast biodiversity. The company transformed its sustainability -ensuring lengthy processes into competitive advantage via innovations and corporate positioning, validating the first hypothesis. The second hypothesis, however, could not be validated – the relationship between more sophisticated consu mers and an improved SD agenda. Interviews, previous case studies, and the media coverage indicated that external pressure was emptied by internal pressure for corporate sustainability, most of it from Natura’s leadership.", "The same sources agree that Natura’s positioning has been in line with the global pro - sustainability trend as the UN -led SD agenda advances toward institutionalization. No company will be able to withstand the wallop for increased sustainability. Even Natu ra &Co will face the challenge to deepen its SD practice, as posed by dr. Mattar.", "However, the main finding was beyond the initial hypotheses – the influence of leadership for the adoption of an SD ethos. Sustainability is a long -term, deeply rooted conce rn of Natura, making it what could be called a ‘native sustainable corporation.’ It seems to also be a sustainability -centered company, as per Schneider’s (2014) definition. Companies engaged in the SD agenda can follow two different paths. Sustainability -centered ones comprise the TBL into a wholesome strategy, whereas market -centered companies contribute to sustainability in order to reach the company's ultimate goal of financial performance (Schneider, 2014) . Practitioners and academicians may, respecti vely, implement business plans or conduct studies with the type of company in mind for more effective implementation or evaluation.", "This study is limited by the single case analyzed and the possible uniqueness of the chosen company. This field of study wi ll be complemented and enriched by future research on other companies and especially contrasting with other MNCs that engaged in a sustainability agenda since this concept became an imperative ethical principle (Oermann & Weinert, 2016) . Future studies with Natura &Co may also capture challenges and changes in its corporate ethos brought by leadership alterations, sped up with the increasing fragmentation in ownership and the company ’s fast internationalization process.", "2.3. Article 3 – Balancing Global Corporate Sustainability Engagement in Asymmetric Markets: a Consumer Goods MNE Case Study Abstract This article hypothesizes about the need to adjust corporate sustainability engagement to the asymmetries of local culture, institutions, and market realities. Literature brings two central concerns: first on balancing global and local planning and second on addressing different develop ment levels and national -institutional arrangements. A Case Study with The Coca -Cola Company endorses t he hypotheses and helps to answer the research questions, leading to the creation of a model that identif ies essential corporate sustainability issues an d define s strategies, targets, and plans to a balanced global, local, and individual level. All corporate planning should be tied back to the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals, giving front -line activities a global purpose, both to the corporation and the planet .", "2.3.1. Introduction", "Corporations have become crucial global players and needed participants of the Sustainable Development (SD) efforts (Pless et al., 2012) . The United Nations Organization -led process towards a more sustainable planet (UN and KPMG, 2016b; UN Global Compact, 2012; UN WCED, 1987) increasingly permeated corporate values, strategies, and planni ng (Bitektine, 2011; Brammer & Pavelin, 2005) . As companies accepted more responsibility in SD efforts (Pless et al., 2012) , their policies also became further institutionalized in society’s view (Barbieri et al., 2010) . Thus, other companies had to follow suit, and more sustainable practices became fundamental to corporate survival due to widespread favorable social judgment (Bitektine, 2011) . Schneider (2014) proposes a new logic to businesses, which should target broad objectives encompassing financial goals as well as environmental conservation and social welfare instead of just aimin g at financial results like conventional companies. His study proposes that companies may engage in the SD efforts via two different paths. Market - centered companies’ contributions to sustainability are means to the company’s ultimate goal of increased financial performance (Schneider, 2014) . In contrast, the sustainability - centered ones have the final goal of contributing to Sustainable Development (Schneider,", "2014) , with the financial performance as part of a wholesome means -equation where it is given the same priority as social and environmental protection.", "Beyond the typification differences among companies, the SD institutionalization process is also unequal in different societies (Fransen, 2013) , which leaves way to an uneven engagement in different locations for multinational enterprises (MNEs). The literature signals that the institutional framework expected at a mature, developed country not necessarily can be found in emerging or developing societies (Khanna & Palepu, 2010) . Due to worse regulatory conditions and possibly more corruption in developing countries, overall governance has not evolved at the same pace as more advanced ones, thus changing market competition dynamics between them (Cuervo -Cazurra & Genc, 2008) . The UN’s protocols and agreements recognize these differences and the same investment level’s impracticality between richer and poorer countries, which may have allowed for further differentiation in institutional development related to sustainability. The Kyoto protocol waived developing nations from mandatory climate chang e action and reporting (Amran et al., 2014) . Develope d countries were forced to improve their mechanisms while less developed ones only relied on voluntary disclosures Reyers, Gouws, & Blignaut, 2011) . The gap between these two groups may have widened in the SD enforcement due to the previously lacking regulation and the lenience in the more recent mechanisms.", "This study hypothesizes that corporations’ SD engagement adapts to the asymmetries of the different markets they serve . Each local operation responds to specific stimuli and demands while juggling with the cohesiveness of the MNE’s global policies and precepts. This hypothesis anchors the theoretical and empirical quest of this article, depicted in the following sections. Then, a case study lands the literature conjectures.", "The MNE for the case study was selected following specific guiding principles. First, the corporation needed to be self -declared as a sustainability -oriented company and recognized by stakeholders as such. It should be a consumer goods international business, as these companies tend to be more sensitive to external concerns (Boons et al., 2013) . It also must be present in every region of the world with a direct operation.", "The selected corporation was The Coca -Cola Company. It is among the largest and most capillary distribution businesses globally and aims to follow a sustainable business model (The Coca -Cola Company, 2020a) . In recent years, Coca -Cola changed its mission statement to incorporate the purpose “to refresh the world (…) and to create value and make a difference” (The Coca -Cola Company, 2020a) . At the same time, it maintains a very tight financial -end operation reflected in other communicatio ns, such as the quarterly earnings reports that express the economic impact of the company exclusively, with a language of growth portfolio, consumer -centric innovation, profit/loss, among other economic terms (The Coca -Cola Company, 2020c) .", "This study adds knowledge of corporate institutions’ forecasted realignment to attain a more sustainable operation (Schneider, 2014) . It is also inspired by Fransen’s (2013) provocation for studies about corporate responsibi lity practices on geographic terms, especially on the role of national arrangements in shaping a company’s social and environmental activities. The review of previous studies and the current case provide new insight into both segments. It leads to the proposition of a corporate sustainability engagement model for Consumer Goods Multinational Enterprises (CG-MNEs), mediated by the culture, regulations, and institutional arrangements at the global and local levels, and also the individual level, as consumers are a vital part of their business. The current article may assist researchers in evaluating and comparing corporate sustainability issues’ identification and mitigation. It can also assist international companies’ practitioners in planning and executing their corporate SD programs in the light of regional differences.", "2.3.2. Theoretical Background", "The working definition by Diesendorf is used throughout this article – “Sustainability and sustainable futures are treated here as the goals or endpoints of a process called Sustainable Development” (1999, p. 22). Sustainability is a term used as a short format for Sustainable Development (SD), especially in composed terms, such as “corporate sustainability.” The UN coined the term Sustainable Development in the late 1980s (UN WCED, 1987) and created the basis for institutionalizing the concept. It was responsible for influencing governments and companies to follow this route (Brammer & Pavelin,", "However, when the concept of sustainability started to be adopted, it seemed contrary to professional managers’ work (Luke, 2013, p.87) . The institutionalization process has been unequal in different societies (Fransen, 2013) , and there are corporate and government movements that fake or “greenwash” sustainable initiatives to maintain the status quo (Luke, 2013 ; Milne & Gray, 2013) . Some believe that the corporations’ discourse aims to preserve not the planet but actually their privileges (Luke, 2005) . Its conflicting nature with businesses makes corporate sustainability seem utopic and lacking the foundations to reconcile capitalism with social justice and environmental protection (Harlow et al., 2013) . Others advocate that corporations may lack the will to provoke significant change (Hawken, 2013) or even the necessary power to turn society fully sustainable (Elkington, 2004) .", "Nonetheless, the SD agenda became increasingly influential among companies (Pless et al., 2012) that have reshaped their busin ess models to improve sustainability credentials (Schaltegger & Burritt, 2018; Schneider, 2014) . Many authors discussed the motives behind it, and the current article elected four broad categories of motivations for corporate sustainability to study this phenomenon. Three categories were initially described by Windolph et al. (2014), named Legitimacy, Marke t Success, and Internal Improvement. The fourth motivation appeared in the business finance literature and adds a new perspective, called Social Insurance (Brammer & Pavelin, 2005; P. C. Godfrey, 2005; P. C. Godfrey et al., 2009) .", "Legitimacy is the need to adapt the company’s principles to society’s beliefs through time (Bitektine, 2011; Bitektine et al., 2016) and should be viewed as altruistic. It is the corporate response to institutional theory (Barbieri et al., 2010; Meyer & Rowan, 1977) . Market Success means achieving better results via innovation, differentiation, and communication based on sustainability (Windolph et al., 2014) . It ensures the creation of new products and services (Christensen, 1997, 2006) and the creation of innovative business models to serve the market (Boons et al., 2013; Charter et al., 2008; Hart & Christensen, 2002; Kima et al., 2014) . Internal Improvement is to optimize the companies’ processes in order to reduce costs and the use of resources, also ensuring a more sustainable business (Bansal & Roth, 2000; Darnall, 2003; Windolph et al., 2014) . Finally, Social Insurance is the insurance against reputation losses that cannot be regularly acquired in the marketplace. It aims to prevent financial and goodwill losses", "(Brammer & Pavelin, 2005; P. C. Godfrey et al., 2009) . Unlike the first motivation, the latter may be viewed as a self-serving one to minimize the business risks while benefiting society (Aßländer, 2013; Trebeck, 2008) .", "Legitimacy and Process Improvement appear to be earlier motivations for corporate sustai nability adoption. They are individual responses to institutions (Bitektine et al., 2016) or legis lation and may be initially implemented as basic requirements. Market Success and Social Insurance seem to be later motivations as they are elective alternatives for expansion, innovation, or differentiation (Boons et al., 2013) or for managing risk (Epstein & Roy, 2003) to shield a company’s assets. The adoption rhythm of strategies under the four motivations may indicate the type of company as a Sustainability -End or Market -End, as per Schneider’s (2014) model and the need for adjusting to different local realities (Fransen, 2013) .", "Thus, motivations for SD may change between more and less economically developed nations. On the one hand, this is due to the disparity in institutional strength and governance transparency that tend to advance along with development (Cuervo -Cazurra & Genc, 2008) . On the other hand, the more developed a country, the more there is a competitive marketplace and affluent consum ers, who have the comfort to assess broader ethical considerations when choosing a company or product (Titus & Bradford, 1996) . Corporate sustainability studies with multinational companies strongly suggest that their integration the markets where they operate depends on the alignment with local regulation, business environment, and beliefs (Achabo u et al., 2017; Escobar & Vredenburg, 2011) , even to benefit from advantages provided by policies of their home and host countries’ governments (Silva -Rêgo & Figueira, 2019) . How ever, there are indications that strong stakeholder pressure in a multinational company’s home country may transfer irresponsible practices to subsidiaries in locations where sustainability is not enforced at the same level (Surroca et al., 2013) due to inequalities and development differences. Such is the case of the US corporations, which are more intensely involved in sustainability measures at home than in their subsidiaries’ countries (Hashmi, Damanhouri, & Rana, 2015) . On the reverse side of the coin, exporting companies from less developed countries that do business with developed ones will see improvements in their sustainability agenda (Achabou, Dekhili, & Hamdoun, 2017).", "Even among developed countries, the company’s original region or country influences the commitment level, the elements, and the motivations behind its conduct. (Sotorrío & Sánchez, 2008) . The main takeaway is that even very successful companies must adjust their practices and strategies to different countries (Fragouli & Nicolaidou, 2020) .", "2.3.3. Research Questions and Method", "The present work focuses precisely on how the corporate sustainability agenda is applied in the diff erent global operations. As indicated in the literature, the various institutional arrangements and development levels in different countries create unequal pressure in each market where an MNE is present. Thus, the company may need to adjust the format of its engagement, leading to two research questions:", "1. How do MNEs balance global and local sustainability demands into a comprehensive strategy?", "2. Does engagement vary by country based on socio -economic development and local institutional arrangements?", "This article uses the case study method, and the company is the unit of analysis (Yin, 2009) . It generates reflections from the field based on the theoretical and field literature. All the information was triangulated for improved validity (Creswell & Miller, 2000) with other sources of information, including company reports, investor reports, journal articles, media news articles, observation notes, and one -on-one interviews with current and former executives and sustainability experts. The contrasting sources and interviews, including the critical views, improve the study’s confidence (Creswell, 2014; Järvensivu & Törnroos, 2010) .", "For this single case, the selected company was The Coca -Cola Company (TCCC), among comparable multinational companies headquartered in the U S. A CG-MNE tends to be more sensitive to public concerns both corporately and in relation to their products (D. L. Brown et al. , 2010) . So, retail companies based in the US were the starting point for the search. The United Nations’ pact to voluntary sustainability commitments, the Global Compact, was the source for self -declared SD -committed companies (UN Global Compact, 2019) . Coca -Cola was the most visible one on the list both for its global capillarity, being present in virtually every corner of the world, and for participating in a", "large number of sustainability pacts and organizations (The Coca -Cola Company, 2020a) . The company or its bottling partners have been listed in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index in different years (S&P Global, 2021) . Through time, they have been recognized and awarded several sustainability awards around the world, ranging from the International Wat er Association (The Coca -Cola Company, 2012a) to Best Place to Work (Comparably, 2020) to several recognitions by the Clinton Global Initiative (Clinton Foundation, 2021) , among others.", "Coca-Cola is one of the world’s most visible brands, ranked among the top 10 global brands by different publications (Forbes, 2020; Interbrand, 2020; Visual Capitalist, 2021) .

Among them, 23 theoretical and case studies of variable quality addressing directly or indirectly sustainability and The Coca -Cola Company are cited in this study . They brought contextual information for triangulation or to support oth er pieces of evidence (included in the References and isolated in Appendix 1).

The Coca -Cola Company Case", "The Coca -Cola soft drink was officially launched on May 1886 in Atlanta, USA, and sold an average of ni ne drinks per day for the remainder of the year (The Coca -Cola Company, 2011) . In these more than 130 years, its presence grew to virtually every country, and The Coca-Cola Company became a multibillion global business that manages more than 500 brands (The Coca -Cola Company, 2020a) . In the years 2000, sustainability became a prominent business topic (Epstein & B uhovac, 2014; Pless et al., 2012; Schneider, 2014) and one of the company’s critical subjects communicated on its website and reports. In 2005, a significant change was made to TCCC’s mission statement (The Coca -Cola Company, 2006) to include new wording and values reflecting the sustainable development agenda newly crafted by the company, and in 2018 the business and sustainability reports were combined into one instrument (The Coca -Cola Company, 2019) in response to stakeholders expectations (Herremans, Nazari, & Mahmoudian, TCCC is recognized as a company that strives for business sustainability both by the scientific literature (S. C. Singh & Gupta, 2014; Svensson, Ferro, Hogevold, Padin, & Sosa Varela, 2018) and by the topic -expert stakeholders consulted. Dr. Thomas Lovejoy says that he h as “been very impressed by Coca -Cola’s really sustained behavior and concern about clean water in the world, which, of course, is essential for their products but also incredibly important for everybody” (personal communication, August 2019). Dr. Helio Mat tar agrees that “Coca -Cola has been shaping a very interesting change in its business model over the last 15 or 20 years” (personal communication, July 2019). Even though both would favor faster changes and request further investments from TCCC toward sust ainability, they believe the company is in the top tier of transformational companies globally.", "The company’s global president and COO concedes that “we are unevenly distributed in terms of the pace at which we are moving around the world. One of the things that need to happen is to make that everybody not only understands it conceptually but actuall y does it as a very integral part of the business plan” (personal communication, April 2019). This may be particularly difficult because of the nature of the business. Coca -Cola created a complex enterprise with different players responsible for different activities on the way to retailers. A vast worldwide chain of licensed bottling partners hires distributors and", "wholesalers to reach the most distant locations (Miglietta, Battist, & Campanella, 2017) . Ensuring the Coca -Cola System’s alignment as a whole requires communication and understanding of strate gic purpose, as the company does not directly own or operate its partners (Brondoni, 2019) .", "Corporate Sustain ability History Even though TCCC’s SD strategy only started to be articulated in the years 2000, the executives interviewed have a sense that the sustainability agenda was a continuum to the company’s mission and its charitable contributions. Some believe that they evolved in parallel to changes and expectations in society. The pressure to become a more sustainable company “came from the mission of the company. (…) Anything that Coca - Cola does is expected to be done the right way,” says the CGO (personal co mmunication, April 2019). The Sustainability VP would not even “talk about it as pressure but (…) more as stakeholder engagement in terms of an important part of understanding what is expected (…) from the company” (personal communication, April 2019).", "But some of his colleagues acknowledge that external pressures played a role as well. “Honestly, the external pressure has always been there and will always be there. I do not think that is going to go away, and rightfully so. We are a (…) leading system, an d we need to live up to our standards and leadership,” says the CMO -SB (personal communication, May 2019). For the LA president, “external pressure always helped catalyze sustainability initiatives. As a student, I was impacted by Rio 92 [UN Conference] (… ), and I feel that Coca -Cola knew at that moment that it would be important not only for our business but also for the societies where we were inserted” (personal communication, May 2019).", "Initially, the SD global plan was called “Live Positively” and gathered seven main areas of commitment – water stewardship, community, climate, sustainable package, workplace, beverage benefits, and active lifestyles (The Coca -Cola Company, 2009) . It was the first attempt to put together a comprehensive plan to address Sustainable Development as the Coca -Cola System, i.e., including all bottling partners around the world. This agenda’s communication was simplified to Me, We, World in the next few years, where “Me” meant all areas related to individuals, “We” stood for community activities, and “World” for the environment. It kept the previous plan’s overall targets but", "focused on very specific work areas, namely the three “Ws” Women, Water, and Well - being (The Coca -Cola Company, 2015) . The evolution of TCCC System’s agenda reflects the company’s marketing practice. Communication changes often and is not clearly communicated to stakeholders. Reconstructing the corporate sustainability history can be challenging as only current documents are available on the company’s website. Not even the Sustainability Reports prior to 2018 are easily accessed and re searchers must rely on scarce printed documentation (personal communication, December 2020). However, as the SD agenda was further embedded into its operations, the company started to report its business results using the storyline of sustainability (The Coca -Cola Company, 2019) . Reporting the yearly business results integrated into the sustainability framework signals the importance that the topic gained within TCCC.", "The SD reporting evolution ex poses the need to develop a comprehensive global strategy while allowing room for local implementation and variances within TCCC’s System. “What I have found (…) is that the world is very different. You can find ways to get the commonalities (...). Then, because we are such a local business, we cannot forget that there will be some specific local needs, and we should really understand what they are.” Says the CSO (personal communication, April 2019). The local beliefs, values, and development level must b e contemplated as forecasted in the literature (Khanna & Palepu, Local Implementation “After several years, we finally have a lot of rigor and discipline” to address different countries’ needs, says the CSO (personal communication, April 2019). She explains that certain markets may be more challenging than others due to the lack of infrastructure or resources. “ There are a lot of things that we do in the business in Africa, given some of the inherent challenges that the continent has. (…) we have had a water progr am for many years in terms of helping to bring clean drinking water to communities. (…) We had the Coca -Cola program 5by20 actually started in Africa, and again, helping to empower women,” exemplifies the Regulatory Affairs VP (personal communication, April 2019). In Uganda, she adds, “certain proceeds from every Coke bought in the month of November went towards AIDS orphans. It was a huge campaign.”", "According to the Sustainability VP, “there has always been an opportunity to have some local flexibility on what our sustainability priorities are. It has to make sense, though, in that local context. If HIV is not the issue driving engagement in a market, then, perhaps, that does not mean that there needs to be a big investment (…).” (personal communication, Ap ril 2019). The movement for regulation of sugar content in bottled drinks in Algeria (Boumediene & El Houda, 2018) , the study on PR misuse with children and mothers in the US (Wood, Ruskin, & Sacks, 2020) , and the academic st udy criticizing the influence indirectly exerted by TCCC in overturning the Chinese agenda to combat the obesity epidemic (Greenhalgh, 2019) show how the priorities may shift in different locations.", "The ability to adjust to local calls is possible within the boundaries of the priorities defined globally, meaning that every market must ensur e engagement in the “Ws” strategy and adjust to the perceived needs and pressures in each region or country. Centrally, TCCC commits to funding the Coca -Cola Foundation with 1% of its prior -year operating income for activities within the sustainability str ategy defined by the corporation (The Coca -Cola Company, 2020b) . The Foundation’s president says that it does not transfer funds directly into the operations, but there is an allocation to each area of the world which “through the compliance process for the foundation, [they] are able to direct based on the priorities.” (personal communication, April 2019) According to her, the managers must guarantee the implementation of sustainability activities di rectly from their operation budget, which the Foundation’s allocations may increase to each country. It is a way to support global guidance via additional funding to local operations.", "Economic Development and Legitimation TCCC’s president and COO reaffirm s that company management in each country plays a decisive role in the sustainability agenda implementation. In the case of package recycling, “I would say that it is more of a pressing business issue in places like Western Europe where we have not moved a s fast as we may have moved in Brazil and in Mexico” (personal communication, April 2019). Management in the latter countries may have moved to pre -empt boycotts or had some leverage from previous recycling experiences, as in the case of Brazil’s aluminum can recycling success (Brazilian Aluminum", "Association, 2015) . On the same topic, China faces a different situation. The cou nty already has a large PET bottles’ recycling movement used in the textile and auto parts industries. Nevertheless, for TCCC, it is not enough, as it has a global target of reaching 50% recycled material used in its packaging by 2030, and “India does not allow [it, making] the target impossible without China,” according to the SRA VP (personal communication, April 2019).", "Thus, management in Asia must work with local regulators in both the most populated, diverse, and very economically unequal countries to allow in one and foster in the other the use of bottle -to-bottle recycled PET. For the LA president, the best way to ma ke a difference in the local operations regardless of economic development level is by equalizing the vision of the private sector, the society, and government – “the sustainability processes gain speed rapidly in a region when we can align the three playe rs with clear accountabilities” (personal communication, May 2019). This agility may be required in every market, according to the CMO -SB, as “things can travel very fast,” so that a manager should not “assume that just because it is an emerging market, yo u will have ten years” to adjust the operations to more sustainable levels (personal communication, May 2019).", "Innovation and Market Success All the Coca -Cola executives interviewed agree that markets are requiring better responses to the sustainability c hallenges. The SRA VP says that “for the less developed countries, the needs are perhaps more basic versus more developed countries who count on infrastructure and finance to do a lot more” (personal communication, April 2019). However, for TCCC, it is not only a matter of development as per high GDP or income distribution. The operation in large markets has more possibilities of moving the wheel. According to the CMO -SB, “they have resources, they can dedicate teams (…). In smaller markets, we do not have many people. (…) Size of business might be a real -life burden.” (personal communication, May 2019).", "Although some markets have more resources than others, the innovations at TCCC are primari ly developed in the centralized research laboratory in the company ’s headquarter. “There are now regional research centers outside of the US, the largest in Shanghai. There are also research centers in Europe and Latin America,” explains the Sustainability VP", "(personal communication, April 2019). They focus mostly on pro duct formulation. But the sustainable innovations seem still timid at the company. “I think we are not fully there yet when it comes to innovation. What we are doing right now is adjusting things; for example, we have been reducing the quantity of plastic, ” says the CMO -SB (personal communication, May 2019). For most of the interviews, the sustainable example is “plant bottle,” a plastic sourced partially from renewable sources, such as an ethanol polymer. “What is interesting about plant bottle is that it had been many years before a new material had been used to design PET bottles,” explains the CSO (personal communication, April 2019). For the president and COO, “Plant bottle is one of the innovations where we are creating plastic from organic” (personal communication, April 2019). For the LA president, “we made Plant Bottle in the past” (personal communication, April 2019). Some of them also cited the reduction in sugar or packaging weight. “Anything new, by definition, will tend to have fewer calories, less package, less plastic, more recyclability, and so on,” says the CGO (personal communication, April 2019). The annual reports, press releases, and the media do not bring other examples of sustainable innovations. Especially nothing developed outside of the headquarters’ lab.", "2.3.5. Discussion", "Adjusting to the institutional environment is necessary for every business (North, 1990) , be it for building and maintaining a positive reputation (Soleimani et al., 2014) or for benefiting from the national institutional framework via government policies (Silva -Rêgo & Figueira, 2019) . The case description shows TCCC fully engaged with the topic of sustainability as a market -centered company, adjusted to address the complexities of SD and stakeholders’ management (Schneider, 2014) . Although Coca -Cola has long before been a comp any involved with charitable contributions, following Schneider’s (2014) model, it acted as a traditional profit -narrowed company until the late 1990s, as described by media on the transition of its reputed legendary chairman and CEO Roberto Goizueta to his CFO Douglas Ivester (Deogun, 1997) . Ivester ended up leading the corporation into crisis as he aimed to increase further the financial preponderance (Morris & Seller, 2000) , tightening local investments and concentrating operations, as illustrated by the mistrust provoked by altered products in Belgium that was widely studied by academia (Johnson", "The crisis lasted until a “Manifesto for Growth” was built under new leadership to place sustainability as a primary driver for future growth (The Coca -Cola Company, 2006) . Ever since, TCCC has been working to co nsolidate Sustainable Development at the heart of its operations, as described in the previous section. However, financial gains are the ultimate goal, as declared in the company’s quarterly reports (The Coca -Cola Company, 2020c) without any mentions to SD, which places the company as market - instead of sustainability -centered in Schneider’s (2014) model.", "Drs. Lovejoy and Mattar pointed out three areas where the company should act globally to keep improving its footprint – cutting water use, combating obesit y, and reducing packaging and waste (personal communication, July and August 2019) . These are also the priorities pointed out by TCCC on its reports, together with diminishing carbon emissions to help fight climate change and improving people’s lives (The Coca -Cola Company, 2020a) .", "Nevertheless, they are the main areas of criticism against Coca -Cola around the world. In the 2010s, literature increasingly explored the topic of potential health issues promoted by TCCC (Berg & Feldner, 2017) and specifically on the attempt to encourage an active lifestyle to avoid discussing caloric intake in China, which seems insufficient to avoid the obesity trend (Greenhalgh, 2019) . Water usage is also an area of growing academic discussion as more people face shortages (Fogel & Palmer, 2014) , especially in water - stressed countries such as India (Cullet, 2014) . Finally, a prevalent negative topic has been the global pollution caused by plastic, as the press and environmental organizatio ns pointed TCCC as the largest producer of PET bottles’ litter for two years in a row (Petter, 2019) . The Coca -Cola Company proposes a multi -approach solution to this issue via recycling, reusing, and reducing its packages while also implementing c reative solutions with new materials and designs (The Coca -Cola Company, 2020a) . Even though studies stress that the solutions are not yet consensual nor comprehensive enough (L. Chen, Pelton, & Smith, 2016) , TCCC has projected a strategy th at can be adjusted by region or country.", "Previous studies showed a mutually beneficial relationship resulting from the adaptation between the company and developing markets where it operates. In Ukraine, where one study was developed, the country's econom ic, social, and environmental conditions were positively impacted by the expansion of TCCC’s operations, including improvements in", "waste collection, women empowerment, employment, and exports (Zhavoronkova, Miziuk, & Zhavoronkov, 2020) . In India, the company had to decentralize some processes to open the country for its operations, including advertising w ith Bollywood stars and rebuilding local infrastructure (Fragouli & Nicolaidou, 2020) . The same study concludes that it is critical for business success to understand each market and adjust the strategies to it.", "This article’s hypothesis states that a company’s sustainability engag ement changes according to the requirements of each market it serves, adapting from the original global policies. It is supported both by the case described in the previous section, particularly on subsection “Local Implementation” and the specific cases a nd media articles on TCCC. The first research question on balancing global and local sustainability requirements into a comprehensive strategy is reflected in the bottle -to-bottle recycling example in India and China.", "As in these countries, l egitimation f or TCCC in local markets had to go both ways, adapting to local realities while lobbying for its global policies through regulators, consumers, and stakeholders. Sometimes, global strategies are poorly adapted to different country settings and backlash on the company, such as in the case of the work with scientific organizations to foster an active lifestyle to control weight in the detriment of caloric consumption in China (Greenhalgh, 2019) . It started as a global policy in response to the attacks against sugary beverages exposed by global media, such as The New York Times (O’Connor , 2015) , but ended up considered academically a “low point in the history of public health” (Griffin, 2020) . Negative public opinion led to the dismantling of the a ctivity, which became exemplary as a public relations disaster (The Arthur W. Page Center, 2020) .", "The community’s actual needs and economic development must be considered when implementing the SD corporate strategy (Fransen, 2013) . The previous section, “Economic Development and Legitimation,” described TCCC’s knowledge and strategies to deal with this diversity. Different studies show the need for flexibility in navigating the diversity of the world. One serious issu e faced in poorer countries is child labor in agriculture, estimated in approximately 100 million children globally, maybe hundreds of thousands in sugarcane production (Schwarzbach & Richardson, 2014) . Sugarcane is the main crop to generate income and employm ent in the world (Cockburn,", "Coetzee, Van der Berg, Conlong, & Wtthöft, 2014 ) and the top biomass agricultural plant, cultivated in more than 100 countries (Bonsucro, 2020a) . As the leading buyer of sugar globally, TCCC has encouraged, funded, and subscribed to a series of initiatives in poorer countr ies to promote community improvement (Cockburn et al., 2014) , ensure sustainable production on all the supply chain (Bonsucro, 2020b) , and to protect communities’ land use (Oxfam, 2013) as part of the global sustainability plan with local activation.", "In India, also a large sugarcane grower, t he government created legislation to compel companies to undertake sustainability activities and ensure transparency in reporting the initiatives. Coca -Cola seemed very committed to demonstrating its support of the legislation (S. Singh & Kaur, 2018) as it had to counter numerous accusations related to excessive or hazardous water use in India throughout the years (S. Singh & Kaur, 2018; C. Symons & Lamberton, 2014) . Other countries require a different type of interaction with the government. Ru ssia is reputed for difficulties faced by companies in the relationship with officials and the bureaucracy; Coca -Cola protects its operations by maintaining direct and indirect relations with authorities while stating publicly its economically sustainable pledge to full taxes payment, employment creation, and prohibition of bribes (Salmi & Heikkilä, 2015) .", "In a more affluent country, Israel, a community involvement project almost backlashed due to its marketing -oriented characteristics, a review of the case indicated that the program in many cases ignored the community (Barkay, 2011) . In Islamic countries, the very presence of TCCC products has been questione d due to its possibly adverse health effects, which could be against Sharia law (Yousaf, 2016) . But the company answers by adapting its practice to the different economic levels and cultural realities, as declared by the CMO -SB – “The sustainability topics (...) are already accelerating the thinking on how we avoid problems by taking sustainability as part of the public agenda” (personal communication, May 2019). The adoption of local solutions and local communication answers the s econd research question on how sustainability engagement varies by country. It is based on their socio -economic development and institutional arrangements and depends on each country's relative level of importance to the business. The larger the potential losses, the more incentive companies have to engage and invest in social responsibility and sustainability (Brammer & Pavelin, 2005) and in sustainable", "innovation as a competition tool, leading to new business models (Boons et al., 2013) . Thus, TCCC’s response to challenges in different countries seems proportional to th eir business risk and the teams' actual capability on the ground. As explained by the CMO - SB, larger markets have larger teams and financial reserves while the smaller ones have proportionally fewer resources (personal communication, May 2019), as detailed in subsection “Innovation and Market Success” of the case description.", "This subsection also describes how TCCC still centralizes most of its sustainable innovation initiatives in its headquarters, mainly due to resource optimization. The centralized devel opment of sustainable product innovations, however, may hinder local strategies. The sustainable innovation most cited by the company’s executives was Plant Bottle. It was developed under the sponsorship of TCCC’s headquarter and was increasingly implement ed in different countries (Goldman, 2 015) according to two main directives: external pressure against plastic packaging and sourcing of raw material (personal communication, April 2019).", "Developed and some large emerging countries were the first to include this innovation in their portfol io. Brazil's case is exemplary; besides being among the five largest markets for TCCC globally (The Coca -Cola Company, 2020a) , it is also a large producer of sugar cane ethanol, the material that would substitute petroleum in PET production. Thus , it became one of the first countries to include the innovation in its portfolio, together with the US, and counted on incentives to develop a large production plant to market and export the PlantBottle resin (Pierce, 2014; The Coca -Cola Company, 2012b) . PET packaging seems to be the most significant issue for TCCC in the present, especially in developed markets (Petter, 2019) . Besides the Plant Bottle development, the main initiative is to increase recycling initiatives and re cycled bottles globally. Recycled bottles have been an issue that clearly illustrates the different national institutional arrangements between developed and developing countries as described in the literature (Fransen, 2013) . The more de veloped countries already counted on legislation to allow for recycled bottles when TCCC started implementing this strategy in the 2000s (personal communication, April 2019). Most emerging and developing countries, however, did not count on legislation to allow food -grade recycled packaging (personal communication, April 2019), and Coca -Cola is still lobbying to be able to implement this strategy, thought to be critical to reaching its promise of 100% recycled or reused packaging by 2030 (The", "Coca -Cola Company, 2018) . These central issues have been mapped and disclosed by TCCC in its reports and confirmed in the literature, media, and interviews with company executives and specialists.", "Me, We, the World sustainability framework was the umbrella for TCCC’s corporate sustainability strategy in response to the iss ues. They stand respectfully for individual health, community programs, and planetary environment. Inspired by this approach and this study's findings, an analytical model can be proposed to encompass a cohesive yet flexible corporate sustainability strate gy for CG-MNEs . This model sets off from the definition of critical corporate issues derived from a company’s footprints vis -a-vis the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The SDGs were created by the United Nations Organization and unanimously appro ved by all countries in its assembly. There are 17 goals and 169 targets in this platform (United Nations Organization, 2015) , so every issue is contemplated, but not every company needs to address them all, rather narrowing in the ones where they can make a difference and have a relevant position, i.e., footprint. Figure 2 below illustrates the schematic model proposed.", "Figure 2 –Corporate SD issues engagement Model Each issue selected must be analyze d against the external environment in three levels of strategy – global (planet), local (community), or individual (personal). For CG-MNEs , individuals are critical players in any implementation, as they are the recipients of the products and, in many case s, must play a role in the sustainability of the industry, such as supporting municipal waste collection in recycling (L. Godfrey, 2019) . The strategy", "definition is mediated by external variables, such as market regulations, the existing culture, and other existing institutional arrangements for each level. After defining the strategies, targets and detailed plans are designed mediated by the variables of internal capabilities of the company and the local operation, including human, financial, and research and development resources as well vis -à-vis established commitments with governments and previous planning and ongoing activities. One of the points s tressed by TCCC executives was the need to understand the local operations and resources. More developed markets can devote more resources to plans, and less developed ones need global support.", "In any case, however, a clear tie -in with the SDGs will provi de the thread between a day - to-day activity and a global purpose, possibly igniting the operations’ SD commitment. Knowledge and involvement with the company’s reported activities are deemed as ways to improve employee engagement (Searcy & Buslovich, 2014) and ensure the application of corporat e sustainability concepts on the ground. The collection of all corporate issues in the three levels for each market, followed by the targets and action plans, should be the heart of a corporate sustainability program. It aligns global priorities, represent ed by the SDGs, to the company’s significant footprints and allows for empirical analyses, scenario creation, and strategy building related to international and local corporate sustainability.", "2.3.6. Conclusion", "This article aimed to evaluate the corporate sustain ability engagement of CG-MNEs , based on a hypothesis about the necessary adjustment of policies and plans to the asymmetries of different geographies. The literature led to two research questions inspired by challenges posed by Schnei der (2014) and Fransen (2013) . The first question was how to balance the global and local strategies into a comprehensive unity. The second explored the engagement differences by country development and national -institutional arrangements.", "The hypothesis could be endorsed by the corporate sustainability case study of The Coca - Cola Company. TCCC can be described as an advanced “protocol” company, meaning that it follows all regulations and goes beyond by setting strict global rules to ensure sustainability standards in all its value chain. According to Coca -Cola’s president and", "COO, his objective is to ensure that its sustainability principles are wholly embedded in its operations and internalized by e very employee and business partner everywhere (personal communication, Abril 2019). At a local level, subsidiaries and bottling partners have the ability to go further, depending on local conditions and operational or financial capabilities. Developed coun tries and the large emerging ones seem to have benefited most from these sustainability investments, given their relative importance to the global business and local operations’ financial strength. The company can be labeled a market - centered sustainabilit y company based on the model developed by Anselm Schneider The literature and the case study led to the theoretical contribution of a model to identify critical corporate sustainability issues and adequately define strategies, targets, and plans pertaining to a global, local, and individual level. Identifying the corporate issues should be the encounter between the most meaningful company’s footprints against the UN’s SDGs. The quest proposed by the UN is to reach the Sustainable Development Goals b y 2030, with the engagement of governments, companies, and communities. A global corporate sustainability plan derived from the corporate issues contributes to this achievement while recognizing inequalities and narrowing the gaps between countries toward more uniformity.", "This Case Study confirms that implementing an MNE sustainability agenda depends significantly on local circumstances, even for a company with specific global targets and guidelines. The pursuit for uniformity seems still distant. The sus tainability specialists Dr. Lovejoy and Dr. Mattar both expressed fears that the speed of change may be insufficient to reach the SDGs and, particularly, the climate change targets. The present study contributes with a model to assess CG -MNEs’ corporate su stainability strategies both for scholars and practitioners. It lands theoretical arguments in a case study that indicates the need to address corporate sustainability issues both locally and globally harmoniously. The tie -in of local strategies and activi ties with planetary and corporate priorities gives purpose and builds a global value network. It is a reflection that contributes to the theoretical debate on how companies can advance to support global challenges. Practitioners as well can bring this refl ection into their planning process. The corporate issues engagement model and the acquaintance with a global company SD case may contribute to better planning and understanding of their own needs and opportunities.", "This study’s limitations include the fact that it is a single case study and deals with a large global company's geographic imperative. As the company is present in every location of the world, the observational data and interviews were collected in just a few locations in two countries (the USA, global HQ, and Brazil, LA presidency). The proposed model itself is limited by the construction based on theory and one company case study; it must be further improved.", "Future case studies with The Coca -Cola Company may add more information on the actual motivation and engagement with SD globally and in different locations. Studies with other companies may bring a valuable contribution to validating the hypothesis projected in this article with other MNEs. Broader studies will help understand the gap betwe en developed, emerging, and developing nations’ businesses to sustainable development and the SDGs' attainment. The proposed model can be applied to, refined, and improved with other organizations’ studies. Finally, longitudinal studies with different comp anies may bring new knowledge about the timing of corporate sustainability engagement and implementation processes.", "3. DISSERTATION ’S CONCLUSION", "3.1. Synthesis", "Three isolated yet interdependent journal articles composed the previous chapter. The current Synthesis connect s the three articles among them and with the Dissertation’s objectives and conceptual architecture to present the results in an encompassing synopsis . This Dissertation’s questions versed on (1) what motivates companies’ engagement in different regions of the world and (2) how engagement evolves within Consumer Goods MNEs from an emerging and a developed economy.", "Article One was devoted to the first question. From the literature, it elected authors that worked toward a model of broad corporate motivations for sustainability (Bansal & Roth, 2000; Brammer & Pavelin, 2005; Darnall, 2003; Epstein, 2008; P. C. Godfrey, 2005; P. C. Godfrey et al., 2009; Windolph et al., 2014) . These motivations were Legitimacy, Market Success, Process Improvement, and Social Insurance. Each of them addresses different aspects of the reasons behind companies’ engagement globally and were the basis for the whole work.", "These motivations were then validated against 90 scientific field articles from every region of the world to derive the findings , and the propositions were later tested in the case studies with CG-MNEs. The main findings were that:", " Scientific interest in corporate sustainability was on the rise since it appeared as a topic in the early 2000s;  Legitimacy was the most prevalent motivati on, followed by Process Improvement and Market Success, and lastly by Social Insurance;  Legitimacy and Process Improvement appeared early as an academic interest, followed by Market Success and Social Insurance;  The most significant number of articles were global ones, but, as a macro -region , the one that counted with more interest on corporate SD was Europe, followed by Asia, North America, Africa, and Latin America; and  The more developed regions had more studies in Market Success and Process Improvement than less developed ones.", "A framework, reproduced in Figure 3.1 below, contained the propositions into two main axes along with the motivations. One axis suggests that some motivations appear longitudinally , some at an earlier and others at a later stage. The other indicates that different markets /countries adopt different motivations depending on their sophistication or competitiveness level.", "Figure 3.1 – Motivations ’ framework (Article One) Article one’s in-depth analysis of the literature and field papers answered the first research question with propositions for further research in the two axes. Longitudinally , the findings led to consider that (1) motivations change over time and (2) early motivations are connected to compliance , and later ones to competition. Regionally, the beliefs were that (1) motivations vary based on socio -economic development; (2) the more developed the market, the more motivation to embed innovative initiatives towa rd business growth; (3) motivations in each market are independent of a corporation’s national origin; and (4) motivations will change as development level of a country changes. The second and third articles operationalized these outcomes . They concentrate d on testing the proposition s in CG-MNEs from an emerging and a developed market. For clarity purposes, as the articles had to stand on their own, each highlighted some specific points and counted on its own literature review and method but had the same overall background of understan ding how corporate sustainability was adopted and expanded in", "the two companies studied. The first case study highlighted leadership's effect on SD engagement, as previously signaled in the literature (Lozano, 2015) . The framework created in Article One purposefully excluded the leadership factor to initiate the companies’ analysis in a level playing field, independent of individual belief. However , it is recognized and understood as a possible propulsion or repressing force to corporate sustainability and must be considered when it appears as a compelling element in a case. The corporations studied were selected among the Global Compact members (UN Global Compact, 2019) , listed in Appendix 1, which portrays their commitment to Sustainable Development. They are large international Consumer Goods Companies, among the market leaders both in the domestic and global markets, operating in every one of the world’s macro -regions (United Nations Statistics Division, 2012) , with periodical financial and sustainability reports.", "Despite these similarities and their business success, the two companies operate in different markets and, naturally, have a different business story. The Coca -Cola Company has been an international company since the 1920s (The Coca-Cola Company, 2021) , when it started to plan a global strategy and sponsored its first Olympics Games in 1928. Natura is a product of the much more recent globalization wave of emerging countries’ companies (Gu & Lu, 2011) . It only started direct international operations in 1994 in South America’s neighbors Argentina and Chile (Natura &Co, 2021) and took more than 25 years to strengthen international operations to the point of surpassing their domestic revenues, according to its CEO (Personal Communication, July 2019). The American company has had the majority of its revenues coming from international operations for decades.", "TCCC has also been a publicly -traded company for over one century, and its last dominant shareowner was chairman Robert Woodruff in the 1950s (The Coca -Cola Company, 2021) . At Natura &Co, the founders are still very present as members of the company’s board (Natura &Co, 2020a) . Even though they only own approximately one- third of the company (B3 Stock Exchange, 2020) , they still significantly influence Natura &Co’s directives. More data on the two companies in Figure 3.2.", "Figure 3.2 – Data on Case Studies’ companies", "Their sustainability history also followed different paths. At Natura &Co, all sources consulted on developing the case study pointed out the embeddedness of SD into its operations since the company’s creation. At TCCC, the efforts toward fully compromising with this agenda are still underway, as pointed out by the company’s president and COO himself (Personal Communication, April 2019).", "Both companies have engaged in a complete corporate sustainability agenda, as seen in the cases and summarized in Figure 3.2 above. As stated in each case's conclus ion, however, the end-goal appears to be different among the companies. While Natura &Co reached a Triple Bottom Line modus operandi , TCCC narrows its focus on the financial rewards with the social and environmental aspects treated as means to reach this end- goal. According to Schneider’s (2014) model, the former would be a sustainability - centered company while the latter can be described as a market -centered company. As clarified before, each case study had to stand on its own for journal submission and, thus, examin ed specific aspects of corporate sustainability . However, both brought the entire information related to the Article One propositions described throughout the text. To assess the level of empirical support to the propositions found in each case study and between them , Figure 3.3 was composed using this information . It counts on a scale of increasing empirical support from the cases with qualitative gradings of No, Weak, Partial, and Strong. Of the six propositions, three were found to count on Strong support; among the other three, one had Partial, one Weak, and one No empirical support. For P6, no evidence was found in the cases; however, it cannot be disca rded because the SD science is still too recent to capture significant changes in countries’ development or its impact in institutional arrangements that influence companies. Thus, most of the propositions were endorsed empirically by the case studies , and none of them can be viewed as rejected . That allows for the additional theoretical considerations presented in this section.", "Figure 3.3 – Propositions’ Empirical Support This study proposes a new typology for corporate engagement with Sustainable Development. Given the two cases and the 90 papers analyzed for Article One, there appears that companies can pursue either a Native or a Protocol sustainability engagement. The difference between them is the level of integration of the agenda within a business. In the Native company, SD is engrained in its DNA. One indication is the company being market - or sustainability -centered (Schneider, 2014) , but there are other dimensions to consider. The national origin did not play a role in the two cases, maybe because they were corporate sustainability references from this research’s start and are international companies that play by global rules. Howeve r, both theoretical (Amran et al., 2014; Nidumolu et al., 2009) and field literature (Achabou et al., 2017; Escobar & Vredenburg, 2011; Surroca et al., 2013) report that there may be differences in the way companies handle sustainability in accordance to each country’s development level, independently of their national origins.", "Leadership was excluded from the framework proposed in Article One due to the sensible reasoning that the exclusion prevent s dissonance due to individual behavior (Win dolph et al., 2014) . Many leaders adopt an SD agenda in pursuit of legitimacy (Meyer & Rowan, 1977) , social approval (Bitektine, 2011) , or personal ethics and honorability (Aguinis & Glavas, 2012; Aßländer, 2013) . Nevertheless, studies have shown that it is one of the main reasons to embrace sustainability, together with customer demand and regulation (Lozano, 2015) . It is also a key factor for a business to become a Native sustainable company. In the Natura &Co case, the leadership factor was crucial for ensuring the level of commitment to the SD agenda achieved by the company and recognized by all stakeholders.", "In The Coca -Cola Company case study, leadership has given different importance levels to the topic through time. Stakeholders recognize the comp any’s efforts toward the TBL, but sustainability is yet not engrained in each business executive practice. With the increasing pressure exerted by global leadership as reported by the COO and the CSO (Personal Communication, April 2019) and the growing pursuit for sustainability reflected in the company’s reports (The Coca -Cola Company, 2019) , this seems to be changing toward a long-term policy .", "In the model proposed below, there are three types of companies portr ayed . Two are the companies that take Sustainable Development into consideration for guiding its practice", "and strategies , named Protocol and Native ones, depending on the level of integration with the business . The companies that do not consider sustainability a key asset are present in the model as Non-SD-Oriented ones. These are firms that strive for growing revenues and profit, tackling additional issues as required by legislation. They address sustainability only as demanded , and have previously been named “Conventional Companies” in the literature (Schneider, 2014) . The Non-SD-Oriented companies were not the subject of this study, thus they are defined by the exclusion of the sustainability attributes .", "Protocol and Native companies, on the other hand, incorporate the SD agenda beyond its institutional aspects and innovate from this foundation. The corporate sustainability motivation s framework in Article One already indicated that companies with a longer sustainability history in more competitive markets would be more inclined to adopt sustainable strategies. The comparison between the Natura and the Coca -Cola Case Studies allowed to better detail the attributes that would make SD further engrained into the firm’s culture and philosophy.", "A Protocol sustainable company must count on attributes that are among the ones that helped to select this work’s case studies, including (1) self-identity as a company striving for sustainability; (2) the membership to Global Compact (used in this Dissertation) or similar pacts; (3) publication of periodical SD reports; (4) participation in rankings, accreditations, and awards that form evidence of public recognition of corporate sustainability; and (5) sustainable projects driving part of its innovation initiatives. The findings allow inferring that this would be the initial stage of an SD-centered firm. A Native sustainable company counts on the same attributes of a Protocol one but goes beyond. The SD agenda is part of the day-to-day business naturally, as if written in its corporate DNA. The additional attributes for a Native company would be primarily (1) long-term SD-focused leadership, (2) executive rewards’ system dependent on susta inability goals, (3) sustainable directives enforced on top of financial priorities, and (4) fully sustainable business cases for growth and innovation. In this scenario, all innovation comes from sustainability, leaving no room for conventional revenues - seeking -only new products and services.", "This theoretical generalization based on the three articles differs from Schneider’s (2014) side-by-side evolution model. The process from being a Non-SD-Oriented to a Protocol to a Native CG-MNE is viewed as a continuum, where additional attributes increase the engagement with corporate sustainability and transform the way a company operates .", "Figure 3.4 summarizes the proposed typology . The Native stage would be the highest one in this typology. However, as cautioned by Dr. Mattar, even the most SD engaged companies have not yet reached the ideal operation to be considered fully sustainable (Personal Communication, July 7, 2019). So, it is possible that the attributes related to each stage may change in the future as standards and expectations become stricter.", "Figure 3.4 – Summary of attributes – Typology for corporate engagement with sustainability", "3.2. Conclusions", "This doctoral Dissertation concentrated on consumer goods multinational companies’ motivations and engagement for corporate sustainability. To understand the dynamics of this once considered antithetical connection (Luke, 2013) and propose an engagement model, the work was split into three articles . The first one elected the motivations for sustainability found in previous studies and reviewed them against field cases from every world region . The other two were in-depth case studies conducted with CG-MNEs from a developed and an emerging country.", "Empirical evidence from the cases indicates that the engagement with sustainability changes through time, mostly from compliance to institutions into differentiations aimed at success in each market. It also suggests that the motivations and engagement change according to each local operation’s development level, independently from the company’s country -of-origin.", "Three main quests can delimit the overall research questions that operationalized this Dissertation’s work . The first relate s to the motivations for companies to e ngage with sustainability. The second concerns local differences in relation to global companies’ priorities . And the third , the pace of this engagement in different companies. To each of those quests, th is study responded with a theoretic abstraction mode l that can operationalize scientific studies and organizational reflection: the framework of corporate motivations for sustainability in Article One, the corporate SD issues engagement in Article Three, and the typology for corporate engagement in the prev ious section. Besides, a relevant topic was raised in Article Two, versing about the leadership factor, which cannot be disregarded , especially in extreme belief or disbelief in the corporate sustainability agenda.", "Two main theories and the Sustainable Development literature were the foundations for this dissertation . The findings reflected the Institutional and Innovation theories while striving to advance the knowledge on corporate sustainability. Article One’s framework proposes that companies move from adopting SD due to institutional regulation (North, 1990) into innovating for competitive reasons (Barbieri et al., 2010; Boons et al., 2013) . The two cases applied the framework via the questionnaire and part of the coding process ,", "and both exposed motivations related to legitimacy and innovation . Natura &Co built its credentials due to the SD institutionalization throughout the business while creating new products and implementing new process es with a sustainability mindset. As predicted in the literature (Bitektine, 2011) , The Coca-Cola Company rejuvenated its corporate brand with similar messages to obtain society’s subjective approval .", "The motivations’ research also reinforced longitudinal and regional considerations to corporate sustainability engagement. The field studies analyzed and the case studies with Natura &Co and TCCC also fulfilled part of the gaps related to national -institutional arrangements and corporate sustainability (FRANSEN, 2013) and brought new insight s on the differences between a developed country MNE and this new phenomenon of an emerging market ’s one (GU; LU, 2011) .", "As a whole, this Dissertation expects to bring new reflections to the topic of corporate sustainability and help organize the discussion s on motivations, engagement, and, in the end, its practice.", "3.2.1. Contributions and Limitations", "Each one of the articles discussed their specific contributions. As a whole, this Dissertation provides theoretical contributions to the field of corporate sustainability, especially embodied in the three new models proposed. They can help both practitioners within multinational or local enterprises and scholars in the field of corporate sustainability.", "Also, the discussions behind these models may be recorded as contribution s on their own. Identifying four corporate sustainability motivations based on diverse theoretical literature and tested against field articles is one. The treatment of the Natura &Co case's leadership factor is another one, as it may model future studies with the same or other companies . Yet another is the matter of issue identification for the development of sensible corporate sustainability strateg ies, discussed in the TCCC case, which may subsid ize studies in the areas of business as well as communications. Finally, the Synthesis section proposes a theoretical generalization for how CG-MNEs and other multinational companies might evolve as they integrate sustainability into their business , leading to the proposed typology . From an externally imposed agenda to an", "internalized source of growth and innovation opportunities, these companies may move from conventional to becoming Protocol and then Native sustainability companies. Besides supporting studies interested in corpora te sustainability engagement , these discussions and the model s may also function as a roadmap to practitioners who intend to strategically develop their organizations , as required by the SD institutionalization . However, the limitations of this study are manifold. Among the most significant ones:  Only two case studies were conducted .", " Only one segment was addressed – CG-MNEs .", " Only companies recognized in SD engagement were studied .  Only two countries -of-origin , an emerging and a developed one.  The interviewees' corporate level for the cases was mainly limited to senior officers from each companies’ HQ.", " The longitudinal storyline of each company was reconstructed via documentation, as the timing for observation was restricted .  The great majority of the literature was in English only (with few exceptions of Portuguese and Spanish studies indexed in English) .", "These limitations and the contributions of the work lead to a series of future stud y opportunities .", "3.2.2. Future studies", "There are a plethora of studies that can be derived from this Dissertation. The corporate SD motivations framework was developed based on studies from many different industries, including business -to-business companies. However, all the literature was indexed in English . Other languages may bring different insights. The framework was only tested against two companies from two countries and CG- MNEs, even from different countries. So, more consumer goods companies may provide relevant additional information to corro borate or reform the findings. Studies on companies in other segments , industries , and countries may reveal different realities and engagement formats . The study concentrated on reputable companies for their SD work . Adding non-reputable companies may bring new perspectives too.", "Interviews were primarily conducted with high-level business executives working at headquarters from the two companies. More comprehensive observations can be made reaching employees at different organizational levels and in different locations and countries.", "More extended longitudinal studies will be important to define and refine strategic paths for changing institutional arrangements. Proposition 6 was not supported , as it demands significant temporal gaps to assess modifications. As discussed in the Synthesis section, both the field and theoretical literature indicate that these changes shall be captured. Also, there is an opportunity to test and fit the models presented in the last case, on corporate sustainability engagement , and the company typology in the Synthesis .

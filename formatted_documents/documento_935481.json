New insights on intumescence: the influence of the nature and the strength of montmorillonite’s acidic sites on the flame -retarding properties of polymeric composites. Rio de Janeiro, 2021. Tese (Doutorado em Ciências/ Química) – Instituto de Química, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, 2021", "In order to investigate the influence of the acidity of montmorillonites (Mt) on the fl ame- retarding properties of intumescent composites, a raw montmorillonite was submitted to acidic activation during different periods of time, producing Mt samples containing acidic sites with different strengths and the natures (Brønsted and Lewis), which were then incorporated into intumescent polymeric composites. The raw and acidic -activated Mt samples were characterized by X -ray fluorescence (XRF), X -ray diffraction (XRD), nitrogen adsorption analysis and particle size distribution. Their acidity was q uantified by ammonia temperature - programmed desorption (TPD -NH 3) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy with pyridine adsorption (FTIR -Pyr). The clays were added to two different intumescent systems. The first one was composed by ammonium polyphosphat e (APP) and pentaerythritol (PER) as the intumescent formulation in a poly propylene (PP) matrix, processed by twin -screw extrusion and thermo -compression molding. The second one was composed by APP and lignin as the intumescent formulation in a poly(lactic acid) (PLA) matrix, processed by two different techniques: twin -screw extrusion followed by injection molding, and fused filament fabrication (FFF) to 3D -printed. The neat polymeric samples and the composites were submitted to thermogravimetric analysis c oupled to Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (TGA -FTIR), limiting oxygen index (LOI), UL -94 vertical test and cone calorimeter test (CC) in order to determine their thermal stability and flame -retardant properties. The burnt residues were submitted to (FTIR) spectroscopy, XRD and scanning electronic microscopy (SEM). The mechanical properties of the composites were determined by tensile tests.", "For the first system, PP/APP -PER/clay, the LOI results suggest a competition between the nature and the stren gth of the acidic sites, as a better performance was achieved for the systems with an excess of Brønsted sites relative to the Lewis ones, preferably for moderate - strength sites to the strong ones, as the latter seems to be detrimental to the flame -retardi ng properties. It is possible that the Br ønsted sites takes part in the esterification reaction between APP and PER, contributing to a more efficient ester conversion and subsequent cyclization process to produce the polyaromatic structures that will give rise to the char. In addition, the absence of those sites could be responsible for a lower efficiency in the esterification reactions, impairing the flame -retarding properties. The tensile tests shows that the addition of the clay minerals did not affect t he mechanical properties of the intumescent composites. For the second system, PLA/APP/lignin/clay, similar results were found for both injected and 3D -printed composites. The best performance in the flammability tests was achieved by the composites cont aining clays with only weak and moderate strength acidic sites, whereas the system containing strong sites (with a high density of Lewis ones) presents poor fire-retarding properties. It is possible that those strong acidic sites compromise the esterificat ion kinetics, impairing the cyclization reactions. Concerning the mechanical tests, the injected composites present higher Young’s modulus tensile strength values than the 3D -printed ones, except for the PLA/AP/Lig, which showed similar values for injected and 3D -printed samples. Among the composites containing clay, no significant changes in the mechanical properties were observed for a same processing technique.", "Keywords: thermoplastics, polypropylene, PP, biopolymers, biocomposite, poly(lactic acid) , PLA, flame -retardant, intumescent composite, montmorillonite acidity, Brønsted acidity, Lewis acidity , pyridine adsorption, synergistic agent, 3D-printing, fused filament fabrication", "List of Figures Figure 1.1 Growth of the plastic production from 1950 to 2019, in million tonnes.

Th e focus of the papers concerns the study of the influence of the acidity of the montmorillonites on the flame retardant properties of intumescent polymeric composites.", "The “Results and Discussion” section of this Thesis is composed of two main parts. Part I consists of two papers (labelled as Chapter 2 and Chapter 3) and the discussion about the Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) results (Chapter 4) , which deal with the intumescent system composed by ammonium polyphosphate (APP) and pentaerythritol (PER) in a polypropylene matrix. Chapter 2 presents a thorough characterization of the used raw and acidic -activated Brazilian montmorillonite, including the investigation of their acidic sites distribution , in terms of their nature and strength, as well as their i nfluence on the flame - retarding properties of the composites, using the limit oxygen test (LOI) as the main flammability test. Chapter 3 expands this investigation through the analysis of both the gaseous and condensed phase products from the burning of th e materials at different temperatures, this time evaluating the influence of the acidity on the flame -retarding properties using another important flammability test, the cone calorimeter test.", "In Part II, composed of two chapters, a new intumescent system is investigated, constituted by ammonium polyphosphate (APP), an alkaline lignin (Lig) and the same Brazilian montmorillonites , this time using poly(lactic acid) (PLA) as the polymeric matrix. Chapter 5 deals with the influence of the concentration of APP and a raw Brazilian montmorillonite on the flame -retarding properties of the composites. A positive impact was observed on the flame retardant properties obtained with the addition of a new intumescent f ormulation composed of APP, alkaline lignin and montmorillonite. In addition, the results of this study indicated the best concentration of the additives in order to proceed with the work presented in Chapter 6. In this last chapter, the PLA composites wer e produced through two different processing techniques: extrusion/ injection and fused filament fabrication (FFF). Both the processing technique and the influence of the acidity of the montmorillonites on the fire behaviour of injected and 3D - printed comp osites were evaluated.", "The present Thesis is based on the following papers:", "1 Martins, R.

From hygienic products, medical materials, high -technological devices, to transport industry and construction market, plastics make part of our everyday lives. A rec ent study (SKOCZINSKI et al., 2021) (Figure 1.1) presents the growth of the plastic production from 1950 to 2019, in million tonnes. The total worldwide production, which was around 100 million tonnes in 1990, more than triplicated in less than 30 years, achieving 376.8 million tonnes in 2019. From this amount, 99% corresponds to fossil -based plastics, while the bio -based ones represent only 1%. Another study (PLASTICS EUROPE - ASSOCIATION OF PLASTIC MANUFACTURERS (ORGANIZATION), 2020) (Figure 1.2) shows that the polyolefins polyprolpylene (PP) and polyethylene (PE) lead the plastic demand by European converters in 2019, with a demand of alm ost 10 million tonnes for PP. Among the main applications of the plastics in Europe, the packaging and the building & construction segments represent the largest markets, accounting for 60% of the total plastic converter demand ( Figure 1.3) (PLASTICS EUROPE - ASSOCIATION OF PLASTIC MANUFACTURERS (ORGANIZATION), 2020) .", "The automotive and electrical & electronic segments are classified in the third and fourth places, respectively, respon ding for 15.8% of the plastic converters demand in Europe. Nevertheless, despite the high versatility and enormous variety of applications of plastics in the modern society, their inherent flammable character presents a real risk for people’s lives, requir ing specific legislation and scientific research in order to produce safer materials. According to the most recent resport of the CTIF ( Comité Technique International de prevention et d'extinction de Feu ) World Fire Statistics Center (BRUSHLINSKY et al., 2021) , Brazil occupies the 20th place in estimated deaths from fire, heat and hot substances, with 1028 deaths per year. Also, the U.S. Fire Administration (USFA) (“U.S. Fire Statistics”, [s.d.]) , reported that the number of deaths in the United States of America has increased by 24.1% from 2010 to 2019 (with 3079 deaths in 2019), as well as the economical losses , which increased by 74.5% over the same period, a mounting to US$ 14.8 billion dollars in 2019. Two unforgettable examples can be mentioned. One is the Grenfell Tower fire (London, UK , 2017 ), in which the use of a high flammable polyethylene material in the cladding was the primary", "cause of the fire spread, killing 72 people (BBC NEWS, 2019) . The second one is the Night - Club Kiss fire (Santa Maria, Brazil , 2013 ), in which the Kiss' acoustic stage covering was made with a common polyurethane foam, a highly flammable and toxic material, without flame retardant treatment (MÁRCIO LUIZ (G1/RS), [s.d.]) , causing 242 deaths.", "Figure 1.2 Plastic converters demand by segment in 2019.

The main factors that contribute to this step are the temperature and the oxygen index, defined as the minimum oxygen concentration required to maintain the combust ion.

This mechanism sustains the ign ition and the pyrolysis steps as long as combustible materials are available, making the flames to propagate over the material surface and rendering the burning process irreversible.", "5th) Extinction – in a close system, as the material and the oxygen are consumed, the feedback mechanism can no longer be sustained, initiating the extinction step, which is mainly affected by the oxygen index of the polymeric material.", "Among the many methods and ways of action developed to decrease the flammability of diff erent polymeric matrix, the use of fire retardant additives has been widely applied as they exhibit a versatility to design materials with multifunctional properties (BOURBIGOT; DUQUESNE, 2007a; GALLO; AGNELLI, 1998) . Flame retardants additives must inhibit or suppress the ignition and combustion processes (BOURBIGOT; DUQUESNE, 2007a; GALLO; AGNELLI, 1998) . For a long time, halogenated molecules, such as poly - chlorobiphenyls (PCBs), polybrominated biphenyls (PBBs), polybromodiphenyl ether (PBDE), and penta -, deca - and octa -PBDE and hexabromocyclododecane (HBCDD) were widely used as flame retardants in polymeric materials due to their easy decomposition into highly reactive free radicals, trapping the polymer degradation radicals in the gas phase responsible for maintaining the combustion process (VAHABI et al., 2021) . However, due to their high toxicity and persistence in the environment, some of those halogenated molecules started to be banned in the 1970´s, and this ban has been reinforced in 2004 , with the Stockholm Convention on persistent organic pollutants (POPs) , and also in 2014 (VAHABI et al., 2021) . The ban on halogenated additives fostered the scientific research into alternative flame retardants, from which the phosphorous -based ones showed to be the best substitutes due to their lack of toxicity , when compared to the halogenated flame -retardants , and to their low environmental impact (VAHABI et al., 2021; VELENCOSO et al., 2018; ZAIKOV; LOMAKIN, 2002) . Amid the many ways of action of phos phorous -based systems, the intumescent ones have been investigated as a promising alternative, allied to their feasibility of being incorporated in the polymeric matrix as additives in order to improve the resistance of the composite against fire (VAHABI et al., 2021) .", "1.3 INTUMESCENT F LAME RETARDANT COMPOSITES", "An intumescent formulation consists mainly of a blowing agent, an acid source and a carbonaceous agent. When submitted to high temperatures, these components react in the condensed phase producing an expanded carbonaceous layer (char), which acts as a physical shield, avoiding the interchange of oxygen, heat and fuel between the material surface and the outside, ceasing the flame. A classical formulation studied in the literature involves the physical mixture of ammonium polyphosphate (APP) and pentaerythritol (PER). In this system, APP acts both as an acid source and a blowing agent (due to its thermal decomposition in phosphoric acid and ammonia), whereas PER, a polyhy droxylated organic compound, acts as the carbonaceous agent. The reaction between both compounds was the subject of a thorough investigation conducted mainly along the 80’s and 90´s (BOURBIGOT et al., 1995; BOURBIGOT; LE BRAS; DELOBEL, 1993; CAMINO et al., 1985a; CAMINO; COSTA; MARTINASSO, 1989; CAMINO; COSTA; TROSSARELLI, 1984a, 1984b; DELOBEL et al., 1990) . A summary of the ma in reactions involved is presented below and in Figure 1.4. At temperatures lower than 280 oC, the APP degrades into pyrophosphates and phosphoric acids. These species react with the hydroxyl groups of pentaerythritol, forming phosphate esters. Another possible pathway is the direct reaction between APP and PER to give rise to the phosphate esters (CAMINO et al., 1985b) .", "From 280 oC the phosphate esters decompose, generating unsaturated species. These species undergo several chemical reactions, including Diel s-Alder, producing small aromatic species with alkyl groups branched, which may be bridged by phosphate species (BOURBIGOT; LE BRAS; DELOBEL, 1993) (Figure 1.5).", "Between 280 and 350 oC the blowing agent decomposes, releasing ammonia, which will promote the swelling of the carbonaceous layer in formation. The condensation of the small aromatic species occurs, producing higher molecular mass aromatic species and increasing the rigidity of the intumescent layer (BOURBIGOT; LE BRAS; DELOBEL, 1993) (Figure 1.6). With the increase of the temperature, between 350 and 430 oC, the scission of the P -O- C bonds occurs, decreasing the amount of phospocarbonaceous species. In addition, the condensation of the polyaromatic species becomes more evident, leading to an arrangement in parallel layers (BOURBIGOT; LE BRAS; DELOBEL, 1993) (Figure 1.7).", "Between 430 and 560 oC the condensation process is further developed, leading to a very rigid structure composed by stacks of condensed polyaromatic molecules, the char, with the presence of methylene groups bridging them (BOURBIGOT; LE BRAS; DELOBEL, 1993)", "(Figure 1.8). The high rigidity achieved at this level impairs the stress accommodation, leading to cracks and, consequently, allowing the diffusion of combustible volatiles towards the flame, contributing to the feedback fire cycle.", "Figure 1.4 Scheme of the steps towards the char formation. Adapted from (MAR TINS; REZENDE, M. J. C.; NASCIMENTO, M. A. C.; RIBEIRO, 2017) .", "Figure 1.5 Scheme for small aromatic species with alkyl groups branched, bridged by phosphate species at 280oC (BOURBIGOT; LE BRAS; DELOBEL, 1993) .

The synergistic agents can act physically, enhancing the mechanical properties of the intumescent layer, or chemically, catalysing the char formation reactions, or even in both ways. Works with zeolites (BOURBIGOT et al., 1996a, 1996b; ESTEVÃO et al., 2005) and clays (LECOUVET et al., 2013; RIBEIRO et al., 2019; TANG et al., 2005) attribute the enhancement of the composites fire behaviour to the formation of silicophosphate, aluminophosphate and aluminosilicophosphate species as bridges connecting the condensed aromatic species of the char. These bridges would avoid the further scission of the P -O-C bonds at higher temperatures, maintaining the flexibility of the char, which wil l be lost in the absence of the synergist. In addition, the effect of the ablative reassembling of the silicate layers on the surface of the composites was also remarked (FINA; CUTTICA; CAMINO, 2012; QIN et al., 2021; TANG et al., 2005) , which would be responsible for creating a physical barrier acting as a heat insulator and a mass transport barrier to oxygen and flammable volatiles originated from the thermal degradation of the polymeric matrix. Another interesting aspect concerns the thermal behaviour of organic -treated montmorillonites with alkylammoniu m salts. With the increase of the temperature, these salts undergo Hoffman elimination reactions or S N2 nucleophilic substitution reactions, creating Br ønsted acidic sites on the clay surface (KILIARIS; PAPASPYRIDES, 2010) . The Hoffmann elimination takes place in the presence of a basic anion, such as hydroxide, which extracts a hydrogen from the beta carbon of the alkyl group, forming an olefin and ammonia or amine, depending on the number of salt substitutions of ammonium. In this process, the proton generated from the beta elimination reaction causes an increase in Brönsted acidity in the clay interlayer (RIBEIRO, 2012) . These Brönsted acidic sites catalysis the crosslinking/charring reactions, facilitating the breaking of hydrocarbon bonds and/or the hydrocarbon aromatization (KILIARIS; PAPASPYRIDES, 2010) . The effect of the acidity of zeolites was also investigated in previous works of the group (BERNARDES et al., 2019; RIBEIRO et al., 2020) , showing that the accessibility of the acidic sites and their strength are important factors to improve t he flame -retarding properties of the composites. These previous observations, associated to the literature data, led to the main axis of investigation of this Thesis, which concerns the study of the influence of the strength and the nature (Brønsted and Lewis) of the acidic sites of raw and acidic -activated montmorillonites on the synergistic action with an intumescent formulation in an intumescent polymeric composite.", "1.4 MONTMORILLONITE", "Montmorillonite is the most abundant clay mineral belonging to the gro up of the smectites, with general chemical formula Mx(Al 4-x Mg x)Si8O20(OH) 4. It belongs to the 2:1 phyllosilicates group, or T:O:T ( Tetrahedric: Octahedric: Tetrahedric), whose layers are characterized by structures consisting of two tetrahedral sheets of silica with an octahedral central sheet of alumina, which are joined together by oxygen atoms common to both sheets (PAIVA; MORALES; DÍAZ, 2008) . The layers are held together primarily by van der Waals and electrostatic forces (ZHOU; TONG; YU, 2019) . Between these layers there are gaps – the interlayer space - containing exchangeable cations, such as Na+ and Ca2+, electrostatically fixed (Figure 1. 9). These cations compensate for the negat ive charges generated by isomorphic substitutions that occur in the lattice, such as Al3+ by Mg2+ or Fe2+, or Mg2+ by Li+ (PAIVA; MORALES; DÍAZ, 2008) . Mt clays are naturally hydrophilic and they have the ability to swell due to the permeation of water in the interlayer space (DANA; SARKAR, 2020) , increasing the basal spacing (distance between the plane of one tetrahedral layer and the correspo nding plane of the next tetrahedral layer). This swelling ability is also explored by the introduction of organic species into the interlayer nanospace of the montmorillonite, generally quaternary alkylammonium cations, in order to make its surface hydroph obic and, consequently, to produce functional materials (ZHOU; TONG; YU, 2019) . In the polymeric flame -retardancy context, this aspect is particularly interesting to enhance the exfoli ation and the dispersion of the montmorillonite in the polymeric matrix, producing nanocomposites with improved flame - retarding properties (LAOUTID et al., 2009; ZHOU; TONG; YU, 2019) .", "Montmorillonites can also undergo acidic -activation treatme nts with inorganic acids, such as sulfuric, hydrochloric and phosphoric acids, in order to exchange the interlayer cations by acidic protons (FLESSNER et al., 2001; JEON; NAM, 2019; KUMAR; JASRA; BHAT, 1995; LIU et al., 2013) . This strategy is commonly employed in the literature in order to produce catalysts for esterification reactions in liquid medium (REZENDE et al., 2012; REZENDE; PINTO, 2016) . Dill et al. (DILL et al., 2021) found that the higher the ratio of Brønsted/Lewis acidic sites, the higher the esterification conversion achieved in methyl esterification reactions between me thanol and carboxylic acids catalysed by acid -activated smectites with a high content of montmorillonite. This result was explained by the smaller size of the acidic proton, i. e., the Brønsted acid sites, relative to the Lewis ones, assisting the protonat ion of the oxygen atom of the carboxylic acid carbonyl group, consequently, favouring the nucleophilic attack by methanol. In the context of the intumescent composites, the char", "formation can be promoted by Brønsted and Lewis acid sites present on the clay lattice (KILIARIS; PAPASPYRIDES, 2010) . The Brønsted ones are represented by weakly acidic SiOH groups at the layer edge and by strongly bonded –OH groups, whereas the Lewis sites comprise the partially coordinated metal atoms, such as Al3+, Fe2+ and Fe3+. When submitted to a certain thermal energy, these sites can contribute to the crosslinking of the polymer chains by acting as electron acceptors or coordinating organic radicals (QIN et al., 2005) .", "Among the advantages of using montmorillonite as a synergistic agent in intumescent polymeric composites are its low cost and the low environmental impact (DILL et al., 2021) . The s ociety's growing awareness of changes in consumption habits brings a strong demand to the industry and the scientific community for more sustainable materials. This concern about the environmental issues inspired the second part of this Thesis , which aimed to develop a bio - based flame retardant polymeric composite. To this end, poly(lactic acid) (PLA), being a thermoplastic from renewable sources, such as starch and sugar, is a promising option to replace polyolefins (derived from petroleum) in various app lications (DUBEY et al., 2017; GUO et al., 2017a; KARAMANLIOGLU; PREZIOSI; ROBSON, 2017; LIM; AURAS; RUBINO, 2008) . Additionally, more sustainable alternatives have been sought for the comp osition of the intumescent formulation, using, for example, biologically -based additives such as lignin, phytic acid and tannins as substitutes for the compounds traditionally used (COSTES et al., 2015; LAOUTID et al., 2018a; MANGIN et al., 2018; REGAZZI et al., 2019) .

Adapted fro m (GUTIÉRREZ, 2010) .", "1.5 LIGNIN", "Lignin is a natural polymer, acting as a reinforcement and a protection for the constituent fibers of a vegetable structure (ROUILLY; RIGAL, 2002) and it is the second most abundant natural organic polymer in the flora world (FELDMAN, 2016) . It is mainly made of three phenylpropane units, produced by a complex enzymatic route in the cytosol: a coniferyl alcohol (G), a sinapyl alcohol (S), and lo w amounts of p-coumaryl alcohol (H) ( Figure 1.10a). Next, they are transported to the cell walls, and oxidized by other enzymes leading to phenoxy radicals. These are resonance -stabilized, leading to several forms of radicals that further re act to form lignin via a polymerization process called lignification (TRIBOT et al., 2019) , producing different units ( Figure 1.10b).", "Figure 1.10 (a) Chemical structures of lignin monomers, adapted from (TRIBOT et al., 2019) ; (b) example of the predicted lignin structure of the plant called poplar, containing mainly syringyl and guaiacyl as the phenylpropane units (VANHOLME et al., 2010) .", "Technical lignin, i. e., the natural lignin that was submitted to an industrial process that causes its original structure to be altered, is a by -product of the pulp in the paper industry, which extracts alone 50 –70 million tons of lignin annually. The main source of the technical lignin readily available for use on a larger scale comes from spent pulping liquors and chemical liberation of cellulose fibers from wood. However, the lignin’s potential is still under -exploited, as around 95% of the extracted quantities is used in the form of black liquor for internal energy input in the pulping process (FELDMAN, 2016; TRIBOT et al., 2019) .", "There are many industrial processes used for lignin extraction (FELDMAN, 2016; TRIBOT et al., 2019) but, among them, two process deserve to be highlighted. The first one is the Kraft process, the most used one, representing 96% of the market. It consists of a treatment with sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and sodium sulfide (Na 2S) at a high -temperature (150 –180 °C) for about 2 h, through which most of the lignin is solubilized and captured in the spent pulping liquor called “black liquor ”, which is highly energetic and serves as a fuel for the Kraft plant. The second one is the sulphite pulping, the most ancient pulping method for paper production, through which the lignin is recovered as a by -product. After the development of the high-versatile Kraft process, the sulphite process turned out to be of minor importance, but still responds for most important source of commercially available lignin, as it is not re -used for energy generation at the end of the process. The process makes use of aqueous sulphur dioxide (SO 2) and a sulfite base (calcium, sodium, magnesium or ammonium salts) in order to incorporate sulfonate groups ( –SO 3-) to the benzylic carbon atom of the lignin phenylpropane unit, producing lignosulfonates, which contain higher sulphur, carbohydrate and inorganic impurities than the Kraft lignin (TRIBOT et al., 2019) .", "The greatest challenge concerning the high amounts of lignin, a by -product of industrial processes, is to find an application that valorises it rather than treating lignin as an industrial waste. Taking advantage of its high availability and low price, any value added to the lignin application would bring a significant economic gain (KUN; PUKÁNSZKY, 2017) . One of the areas of interest is the plastic industry, in which lignin can be used as an additive to produce polymeric composites, replacing others of fossil fuel origin, or as a raw material to produce new polymers (KUN; PUKÁNSZKY, 2017; TRIBOT et al., 2019) . Lignin can be functionalized with polar groups in order to enhance its compatibility with hydrophobic polymers or its hydroxyl groups can be crosslinked with other polymers to produce novel materials. In addition, lignin exhibits a good compatibility wi th other biopolymers (i.e. PLA) due to its hydrophilic nature (TRIBOT et al., 2019) and a good thermal stability with high char forming ability (FERRY et al., 2015) . Due to this, studies have been conducted in order to enhance the fire", "behaviour of flame -retarding polymeric composites by the addition of lignin, mainly in a PLA matrix (CARRETIER et al., 2020; CAYLA et al., 2016; FERRY et al., 2015; LI; ZHANG; SU,", "1.6 POLY(LACTIC ACID) (P LA)", "Poly(lactic acid) (PLA) is the most exten sively investigated and utilized aliphatic polyester produced from renewable resources in the human history, with applications in biomedical, packaging, textile fibers and technical items (FARAH; ANDERSON; LANGER, 2016; MURARIU; DUBOIS, 2016) . In addition, PLA is a compostable material, i. e., it can be degraded under industrial compositing conditions (MASUTANI; KIMURA, 2014) . The building monomer for PLA production, the lactic acid (LA), exists in two optically active stereo -isomers, namely L and D enantiomers (S and R in absolute configuration, respectively), as shown in Figure 1.11, and can be obtained by the lactic acid bacteria fermentation of sugar -containing sources or by chemical synthesis (MASUTANI; KIMURA, 2014) . Depending on the species of bacteria, there is a preference for production of the L or D enantiomers, whereas the chemically synthesized lactic acid can result in a racemic mixture (equimolar quantities of the D - and L -lactic acid) or in only on e enantiomer (SHUKLOV et al., 2018; VAN WOUWE et al., 2013) . Due to the ecological approach of the fermentation process (100 % from renewable sources) and to the possibility of stereoselectivity tuning, the fermentation process in normally preferred (MASUTANI; KIMURA, 2014; MURARIU; DUBOIS, 2016) . The choice of the constituent stereoisomer within the polymeric chain affects directly the thermal and mechanical properties of t he PLA material. For example, a higher content of the D -isomer leads to lower melting (T m) and glass transition (T g) temperatures, while the L -isomer is employed to achieve longer degradation times and higher mechanical strength (MURARIU; DUBOIS, 2016) .", "L-lactic acid D-lactic acid Figure 1.11 Stereoisomers of lactic acid. Adapted from (MASUTANI; KIM URA, 2014) . DL-lactic acid", "There are two main routes for the PLA production: by direct polycondensation of lactic acid and by ring -opening polymerization (ROP) via the cyclic dimer (lactide), as summarized in Figure 1.12. The first route requires the use of solvent under high vacuum and temperature, and it is able to produce only low to intermediate molecular weight PLA. This problem can be solved by a chain -extension method, enabling the production of high molecular weig ht PLA, but affecting its properties. The second route, ROP, is by far the most common way to obtain high molecular weight PLA at an industrial scale (LIM; AURAS; RUBINO, 2008) . It involves, at first , the elimination of water in a continuous condensation reaction of aqueous LA in order to produce low molecular oligomers, or prepolymers. Next, with the addition of a catalyst, the oligomers are converted to the cyclic dimer, the lactide, generally throu gh an internal transesterification (“back -biting”) reaction. The mixture of stereoisomers produced by this process is then purified through distillation under vacuum (MURARIU; DUBOIS, 2016) . The ROP reactions can occur through three different mechanisms: anionic, cationic and coordination mecha nisms, making using of different catalysts. Among them, the standard catalyst system utilized for the industrial production of PLA is the tin(II) octoate (stannous bis(2 -ethylhexanoate), Sn(Oct)2, with lauryl alcohol (1 -dodecanol) as a real initiator.

Nowadays, there are many techniques developed for additive manufacturing of polymers, such as the fused filament fabrication (FFF, or fused deposit modelling, FDM), powder bend and inkjet 3D printing (3DP), stereolithography (SLA), selective laser sint ering (SLS), 3D plotting/direct -write and selective heat sintering (SHS), among others (VAHABI et al., 2021) . Each technique has its advantages, disadvantages and limitations. For example, SLS can be only employed with pol ymers in powder, which limits its use to a few polymers such as polycaprolactone and polyamide. The description of each technique is beyond the scope of this Thesis, and further information can be found in references (VAHABI et al., 2021) and (WANG et al., 2017) . The technique used for this work, t he fused filament fabrication (FFF), will be briefly presented.", "FFF printers are the most commonly used for the manufacturing of polymer composites based on thermoplastics with low melting temperature, such as poly(lactic acid) (PLA), acrylonitrile butadie ne styrene (ABS) and polycarbonates (PC) (VAHABI et al., 2021; WANG et al., 2017) . The material filament is fit in a nozzle, where it is heated until achieving the molten state. Then, the material is continuously stretched forward in order to be extruded, depositing the first layer of material onto a mov able platform. The nozzle is able to move in the X -Y axis, designing the pre -established shape of the object, while the platform is able to move in the Z - axis. Once a layer is finished, the building plate moves downward in order to receive the new extrude d layer. Once the filaments cool, they form a complete, solid object. A scheme of a FFF printer is presented in Figure 1.13.", "The FFF technique presents some drawbacks such as the porosity of the deposited filaments and the restricted variety of thermoplastics that can be used, as they need to have suitable melt viscosity (WANG et al., 2017) . Besides, the filaments need to present a calibrated diameter and some flex ibility in order to pass through the nozzle without breaking. On the other hand, FFF presents many advantages relative to the other additive manufacturing techniques, such as simplicity, low cost and high speed printing. In addition, many nozzles can be ar ranged to work over the same object, enabling the deposition of different types of materials simultaneously (WANG et al., 2017) .", "Concurrently to the development of the additive manufacturing technologies, many studies in the literature (DER KLIFT et al., 2016; GUO et al., 2017b; REGAZZI et al., 2018, 2019) seek to adapt the production of the flame -retarding composites to the additive manufacturing processing technolo gies. Some parameters, such as the loading percentage and the dispersion state of the flame retardant, as well as the processability and the viscosity of the composite need to be carefully taken into account during the development of the 3D -printable mater ial. These studies are paving the way towards the development of new generations of printable, flame -retardant polymeric composites, some of them already commercially available (VAHABI et al., 2021) (Figure 1.14).", "Figure 1.13 Schematic representation of a typical FFF printer.

The acidity of the Mt samples was quantified by ammonia temperature -programmed desorption (TPD -NH3) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (F TIR) with pyridine adsorption. The clay minerals were also characterized by X -ray fluorescence (XRF), X -ray diffraction (XRD), nitrogen adsorption analysis and particle size distribution. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), limit oxygen index (LOI) and UL -94 were performed to evaluate the flame -retardant properties and the thermal stability. The TGA results show that the final residue increased 2 to 3-fold in comparison to the values predicted theoretically. The flammability properties achieved a maximum for the system containing an excess of moderate - strength Brønsted sites relative to the Lewis ones, reaching 38% in the LOI test. This result suggests that the presence of these Brønsted acidic sites is important, as they take part in the esterification reacti on between APP and PER which gives rise to the char formation. The FTIR - Pyr adsorption and flammability results indicate that both the nature and strength of the acidic sites influence the flame -retardant properties.", "2.1 INTRODUCTION", "Modern society depends upon polymers, mainly due to their versatility to build up new materials. However, polymers also have a significant disadvantage ascribed to their high flammability (AHMED et al., 2018) . In order to reduce this drawback, several procedures have been developed, such as the use of reactive agents (BENIN et al., 2015; BYARD et al., 2018; WANG; MORGAN; BENIN, 2017) , flame -proof coatings (ALONGI; CAROSIO; MALUCELLI, 2014; APAYDIN et al., 2013; LIANG; NEISIUS; G AAN, 2013) and flame - retardant additives. Among them, the addition of flame retardants to the polymer is the most commonly employed due to the low cost of the raw materials and of the process of incorporating them to the polymeric matrix (AHMED et al., 2017) . Some of the currently most used flame retardant additives are mineral -based on metal hydroxides, e.g., Al(OH) 3, halogenated, phosphorus -based, inorganic (e.g., borates) and the intumescent ones (AHMED et al., 2017) . The latest ones present the great advantage of requiring lower loadings than the other minerals, which helps retaining the mechanical properties of the polymer (VELENCOSO et al., 2018) . Moreover, the intumescent additives do not release highly toxic gases, as the halogenated ones are much cheaper than the inorganic agents (AHMED et al. , 2017) and considered as a low environmental impact alternative (ZAIKOV; LOMAKIN, 2002) .", "An intumescent system consists mainly of a blowing agent, an acid source and a carbonific agent (RIBEIRO; ESTEVÃO; NASCIMENTO, 2007) . Bourbigot et al.", "(BOURBIGOT; LE BRAS; DELOBEL, 1993) and Camino et al. (CAMINO; COS TA; TROSSARELLI, 1984b) have extensively studied the intumescent system composed of ammonium polyphosphate (APP), which works as both the blowing agent and the acid source, and pentaerythritol (PER), which plays the role of the carbonific agent. Bourbig ot et al. (BOURBIGOT; LE BRAS; DELOBEL, 1993) proposed that as the temperature inc reases, degradation of APP takes place, forming acidic species such as phosphoric acid and pyrophosphates. These species react with PER, a polyhydroxylated compound, forming phosphate esters at a temperature lower than 280 oC. On the other hand, Camino et al. (CAMINO et al., 1985a) suggested the di rect reaction between APP and PER, without the previous degradation of the former, as show n in Figure 2.1, to form phosphate esters. According to Delobel et al. (DELOBEL et al., 1990) , in the temperature range of 280 oC < T < 350 oC the phosphorus esters decom pose generating unsaturated compounds which, through Diels –Alder reactions, produce aromatic compounds that are the precursors to the formation of a carbonaceous layer, the char. The blowing agent decomposes, generating gaseous products", "that will cause the char to swell, forming an intumescent protective layer which acts as a physical shield, avoiding the interchange of oxygen, heat and fuel between the material surface and the outside, thus breaking down the fire feedback cycle. However, above 430 oC the l ayer becomes stiffer (BOURBIGOT; LE BRAS; DELOBEL, 1993) , generating cracks and al lowing the diffusion of combustible materials to the flame.", "Montmorillonite (Mt) has been widely investigated as a mineral filler in intumescent flame retardants due to its power in reducing polymer flammability, even when added in small amounts to the polymeric composite (RIBEIRO et al., 2011; YANG et al., 2011a, 2011b) . Among Mt’s advantages should be highlighted not only its a bility to retard heat transfer between the environment and the polymeric material, but also its ability to lower the supply of volatile products released to the gas phase (LIU et al., 2011) . Fina et al. (FINA; CUTTICA; CAMINO, 2012) concluded that the way Mt migrates to the polypropylene surface influences the diffusion of oxygen and, consequently, the composite’s ignition time. Furthermore, due to their low cost, easy access and low environmental impact, clay minerals are largely investigated as solid catalysts (JHA et al., 2013) , especially Mt, whose surface acidity can be modif ied by mineral acid treatment, enhancing their catalytic and adsorption properties for use in organic reactions (TYAGI; CHUDASAMA; JASRA, 2006) , besides presenting swelling and cation exchange capacity (JHA et al., 2013) . Zanetti et al. (ZANETTI et al., 2001) studied the thermal behavior of layered silicate ethylene -vinyl acetate (EVA) nanocompo sites and observed the catalytic effect promoted by the strongly acid sites created due to the thermal decomposition of the silicate modifier when in contact with the polymer. Also, Tang et al. (TANG et al., 2004) investigated intumescent PP/Mt nanocomposites and observed not only the synergistic effect between Mt and the intumescent formulation, but also the catalytic effect addressed to the decomposition of the amine Mt modifier, which would produce strong acid catalytic sites, contributing to the char formation through dehydrogenation -crosslinking reactions.

Thus, clay minerals AH2 and AH5 have a higher concentration of acidic sites than ANa, showing the effectiveness of the acidic treatment on the ANa.

Char formation was thus responsible for the residue boost after burning, as it works as a protective layer between the inner polymeric matrix and the outside environment, avoiding heat, oxygen and volatiles interchange among them.

For the samples without IF, there was no significant improvement in the flame -retarding properties, as the addition of clay mineral increased the LOI value of neat PP (17% O 2) by only one LOI unit (18% O 2). In contrast, the sole addition of IF to PP raised the LOI value to 30% O 2, corresponding to an increase of 13 LOI units.

Furthermore, in comparison to the raw clay mineral ANa, the particle size di stribution changes abruptly for AH2 and varies slightly for AH20, but it does not show a significant variation among ANa, AH5 and K10. Therefore, the particle size distribution cannot justify the different flame -retarding performances achieved by the compo sites. Thus, for a deeper understanding about the nature of the acidity sites of the clay minerals it was necessary to submit the samples to FTIR spectroscopy with pyridine adsorption.", "2.3.8.3 Montmorillonite’s Brønsted and Lewis Acidity: Fourier Transform Infrar ed Spectroscopy with Pyridine Adsorption (FTIR -Pyr) Pyridine is widely employed as a reliable probe molecule in order to investigate both quantitatively and qualitatively the acidic nature of Brønsted and Lewis sites in solid catalysts", "such as zeolites and clay minerals (BARZETTI et al., 1996; DATKA et al., 1992; EMEIS, 1993; HUGHES; WHITE, 1967; JHA et al., 2013; NETO; SCHMAL, 2013; REDDY et al., 2009; ZAKI et al., 1989, 2001) . As thoroughly explained by Busca et al. (BUSCA, 1999) for ionic oxides, surface exposed cations which are coordinati vely unsaturated give rise to Lewis acid sites, while Brønsted acidic sites arise from hydroxyl groups produced by the dissociative water adsorption on the surface of metal oxides. The difference in the interaction with those sites is responsible for vibra tions in the region between 1700 -1400 cm-1 due to the pyridine ring deformation, enabling both the Brønsted and Lewis surface sites to be detected and characterized (AKÇAY, 2005) . The band at 1545 cm-1 is attributed to pyridine adsorbed on Brønsted acidic sites (Bpy), while the IR band at 1450 –1455 cm-1 accounts for pyridine coordinated to Lewi s acidic sites (Lpy). A strong band at 1490 cm -1 is related to pyridine associated with all acid sites, including hydrogen bonding between the pyridine nitrogen atom and –OH groups present on the clay mineral surface, HPy sites (TYAGI; CHUDASAMA; JASRA, 2006) . Among them, the bands at 1545 cm-1 and 1455 cm-1 are reliable for quantifying Brønsted and Lewis acidic sites, respectively, as they are those best resolved in the analyzed spectral range (BARZETTI et al., 1996) . Moreover, the FTIR -Pyr technique also provides useful information on the strength of the acidic sites when desorption is carried out at different temperatures. The higher the temperature in which pyridine is retained, the stronger the acidic site is considered to be, as more energy is necessary to desorb pyridine from that particular site. Figure 2.8 shows the FTIR -Pyr adsorption spectra for the clay minerals ANa, AH2, AH5, AH20 and K10 at 150 ◦C and the desorption spectra at 250, 350 and 450 ◦C, between For samples ANa and AH5, no characteristic bands were observed at 350 oC, while for AH20, even at 250 oC it was not possible to detect them, thus no further spectra were recorded for those samples at higher temperatures. From now on, the acidic sites present only at 150 oC will be referred to as weak sites, those remaining after desorption at 250 oC as moderate strength sites and those remaining after desorption at 350 oC, as strong sites. No bands corresponding to Bpy or Lpy sites were observed at 450 oC within the detect ion limit of the equipment.", "The absorption spectrum at 150 oC of the raw Mt ANa shows the presence of both Bpy sites (bands at 1544 cm-1) and Lpy sites (band at 1447 cm -1), besides an intense band at around 1490 cm-1 (Bpy + Lpy + HPy sites). These values are i n the spectral range observed for FTIR - Pyr adsorption in different types of Mt (JHA et al., 2013; REDDY et al., 2009; TYAGI; CHUDASAMA; JASRA, 2006; ZACCHERIA et al., 2018) . After desorption at 250 oC, the intensities of the three bands decreased, revealing the presence of moderate strength Bpy and LPy sites; at 350 oC no bands were detected, indicating the absence of strong sites.", "Figure 2.8 Fourier transform infrared ( FTIR) spectra for pyridine after adsorption at 150 oC and desorption at increasing temperatures for clay minerals: ( a) ANa; ( b) AH2; ( c) AH5; ( d) AH20; ( e) K10.", "ANa corresponds to the raw Mt and AH2 results from its 2 h acidic ac tivation with 4 mol L-1 H2SO 4 solution. Although the AH2 spectrum after adsorption at 150 oC resembles that of its parent clay mineral, it is possible to observe that the acidic treatment increased the strength of both Bpy and Lpy sites, producing strong s ites, as their respective bands were observed until 350 oC. Tyagi et al. (TYAGI; CHUDA SAMA; JASRA, 2006) studied the surface acidity of Mt after being submitted to conventional hydrothermal, ultrasonic - and microwave -assisted acid digestion techniques by varying the time, the temperature and the H 2SO 4 concentration. According to them, th e Lewis acidic sites are formed when the cations, Al3+, Mg2+ and Fe3+, usually present on the clay mineral edges, are exposed. Moreover, during the acidic activation, two phenomena occur in parallel: the exchange of the interlayer cations by H+ ions and th e leaching of the octahedral cations Al3+, Mg2+ and Fe3+, with their consequent migration to the interlayer space, where they can dissociate water molecules, producing protons, which will act as Brønsted acidic sites.", "As already depicted in the XRD diffrac tograms ( Figure 2.2), there is a gradual loss of the Mt as the time for the acidic activation increases, and this structure breaking is possibly contributing to expose the cations that were originally coordinated within the octahedral sheet. In addition, according to the XRF results (Table 3), the leaching of those cations does occur, reinforcing the observations of Tyagi et al. (TYAGI; CHUDASAMA; JASRA, 2006) and explaining the changes in the FTIR -Pyr spectrum for AH2. However, as observed by Kooli and Jones (KOOLI; JONES, 1997) when studying the catalytic pro perties of a saponite subjected to different acidic treatments, the structure of the clay mineral is gradually destroyed as acidic activation proceeds, causing a reduction of the clay mineral layer charge and consequently the loss of its ability to retain the acidic protons. This can explain the lower intensity bands observed for AH5 at 150 and 250 oC, when compared to ANa and AH2, as well as the loss of the strong sites present in AH2. AH20, which was subjected to an even more severe acid treatment, for 20 h, presents very low intensity bands after adsorption at 150 oC and the absence of any acidic site after desorption at 250 oC. The commercial clay mineral K10 presents weak, moderate strength and strong sites, and it is noticeable that the Lpy bands are r emarkably more intense than the Bpy ones for all desorption temperatures.", "In order to calculate the concentration of acidic sites per mass unit of the sample, the molar extinction coefficients of the Mt -Lpy and Mt -Bpy bands must be known. Many works (BARZETTI et al., 1996; EMEIS, 1993) report these values for zeolites and other solid acid catalysts, but not for Mt. Therefore, the quantification of Bpy and Lpy sites was made through the ratio of the integrated areas for each band area corresponding to Brønsted and Lewis acidity,", "according to Equations 2.1 and 2.2 , where ABpy ,T corresponds to the integrated area of the band around 1545 cm-1 and ALpy ,T to the integrated area of the b and around 1455 cm-1.", "% Bpy sites =ABpy ,T ABpy ,T+ALpy ,T (Equation 2.1)", "% Lpy sites =ALpy ,T ABpy ,T+ALpy ,T (Equation 2.2)", "The results of the calculations, reported in Figure 2.9, provide important insights to understand the better or worse performance of the samples in regard to the results of the LOI flammability test ( Table 2.6). Firstly, comparing ANa (Figure 2.9a) and AH5 (Figure 2.9c), whose intumescent composites present LOI values of 35% and 38%, respectively, it is possible to observe that both clay minerals have weak and moderate strength acidic sites, but that the latter are distributed differently at 250 oC. ANa presents a large excess (more than twice) of Lpy sites (69%) in comparison to its Bpy sites (31%). In contrast, AH5 shows a slight excess of Bpy s ites (55%) relative to Lpy (45%), as well as an enhancement of 3 LOI units. Also, the AH2 intumescent composites show a 35% LOI, but a different line of reasoning is needed to compare this result with that for AH5. By comparing Figure s 2.9b and 2.9c, one can say that both AH2 and AH5 present similar distribution of L Py and Bpy sites at 250 oC, but the presence of strong sites in AH2 (at 350 oC) and their absence in AH5 are the main factors responsible for the difference in the LOI performance. Thus, the presence of strong sites seems to impair the flame -retardancy pro perties.", "Furthermore, AH2 and K10 ( Figure 2.9e), exhibit a similar distribution of both types of site at 250 oC, but now the crucial difference resides in the distribution of the strong sites. K10 has 17% of Bpy and 83% of Lpy sites, whereas AH2 has 25% of Bpy sites and 75% of Lpy sites. The higher ratio (Bpy/Lpy = 1/3) in AH2 compared to almost 1/5 in K10, confers to its intumescent composites a better p erformance in the LOI test (35% compared to 33% for K10). The importance of the medium strength Brønsted acidity is confirmed when examining the results obtained for AH20 ( Figure 2.9d), whose intumescent composites achieved 27% LOI. The absence of any acidic sites at 250 oC, plus the loss of the lamellar structure can impair the action of AH20 as a catalyst of the esterification reaction. Besides, the syst em PP/IF/AH20 showed an even worse performance than the system without any clay mineral, PP/IF (30% LOI). A possible explanation is that the destroyed lamellas of AH20 give rise to a physical barrier between the reactants, minimizing the probability of the esterification reaction and,", "consequently, weakening the flame -retarding properties. This negative effect was also remarked on by Tang et al. (TANG et al., 2004) , who justified poorer flame retarding properties by an ablative reassembling of the silicate layers, which can hinder NH 3, the blowing agent, impairing the material to swell. The swelling process is important in order to increase the barrier distance between the outside char layer exposed to the flames and the inner polymeric matrix, slowing down the transference of heat and, therefore, the composite degradation kinetics.", "Many authors investigated the influence of the acidity of Mt on the catalysis of organic reactions (AKÇAY, 2005; JHA et al., 2013; KOMADEL et al., 1997; REDDY et al., 2009; Figure 2.9 Calculated ratios for Bpy and Lpy acidic sites after pyridine adsorption at 150 oC and desorption at 250 and 350 oC: (a) ANa; ( b) AH2; ( c) AH5; ( d) AH20; ( e) K10.", "TYAGI; CHUDASAMA; JASRA, 2006; ZACCHERIA et al., 2018) . Jha et al. (JHA et al., 2013) prepared metal cation -exchanged Mt catalysts and observed the highest conversion of p - cresol to 2,2 -methylenebis (4 -methy l phenol) with the catalyst exhibiting the highest Brønsted acidity. Reddy et al. (REDDY et al., 2009) studied the role of acidic sites present in Al3+ exchanged raw and K10 Mt, aluminium pillared Mt catalysts and Mt treated with HCl solution. They observed a good correlation between the Brønsted acidic sites ratio and the catalytic activity in the esterif ication of propionic acid with p -cresol and that Lewis acidic sites, even in a high ratio, do not catalyse the reaction.", "Based on these well -established literature results, it is quite reasonable to consider that Mt catalyses the reaction between APP and PER for the systems investigated in this study, at temperatures below 280 oC, to produce the phosphate esters, which gives rise to the precursors of char. This can be the reason why the presence of Brønsted acidic sites ( i.e., moderate strength Bpy sites) at temperatures below 280 oC, is imperative, as they act as a proton -donors for that reaction to occur. Consequently, the char could be formed earlier, enhancing the protection of the inner polymeric matrix, and achieving a better flame -retarding property. Moreover, the presence of strong sites, especially Lewis ones, seems to impair the flame retardancy. One possible explanation is that they can act as traps for the ammonia released in the gas phase from the APP decomposition. Once they retain some of the ammonia molecules, the protective layer partially loses its ability to swell, thus facilitating the transfer of energy between the outer and the inner environments, which is not desirable for an intumescent system. That is why the PP/IF/AH5 system, whose c lay mineral contains only weak and moderate strength sites, with excess of Bpy relative to Lpy, showed the best performance in the LOI test.", "2.4 CONCLUSIONS", "The acidic activation of Mt has proven to be an efficient procedure to change the concentration of aci dic sites (as shown by the TPD -NH 3 results), as well as their nature and strength, as proven by FTIR -Pyr adsorption. The XRF data showed that the exchange of Na+ from the clay mineral interlamellar space by the H+ from the acid was successful, enabling the creation of Brønsted acidic sites. Furthermore, the longer the time it took for acidic activation the greater was the lixiviation of the octahedral sheet cations, which corroborates the loss of Mt organization observed in XRD diffractograms. The acidic tr eatment also contributed to change the specific surface area and the pore volume of the clay minerals . The similarity of those parameters observed for ANa, AH2 and AH5 indicated that the Mt crystalline phase", "organization was preserved, whereas the very low specific surface area and high pore diameter obtained for AH20 confirm the loss of that organization. The particle size dispersion achieves its maximum for AH2 and gradually decreases, becoming more homogeneous with further acidic treatment.", "The SEM imag es for the samples with the intumescent formulation show that the surfaces of the carbonaceous layers are rugged and hilly, whereas in the samples without the intumescent formulation these layers are not formed. This difference in the physical aspect respo nds for the increase of the thermal stability and of the final residue at high temperatures for the composites containing the intumescent formulation. Moreover, the performance in the flammability tests seems to be independent of the particles’ distributio n in the PP matrix. The TGA results show that the incorporation of clay minerals in the intumescent composites raises the intumescent layer´s thermal stability, leading to an increase of the final residue, a factor that is closely related to the improvemen t of the flame -retardant properties. The addition of Mt increases the char degradation temperature in the systems with the intumescent formulation, no matter the nature and the strength of the acidic sites.", "All the intumescent composites, with and without the addition of clay mineral, achieved the best classification in the UL -94 test, V0, while the samples without IF could not be classified. The sole addition of the clay minerals to the polymeric matrix did not change significantly the LOI value for neat PP (17%). However, the opposite effect was observed when the IF was also added. The system PP/IF achieved 30% O 2, whereas this value raised to 33 (for K10), 35 (for ANa and AH2) and 38% O2 (for AH5), once more showing a synergistic action between the clay minerals and the intumescent formulation. However, for the AH20 system this value was lower (27% O2) than that obtained for the PP/IF/composite.", "Finally, FTIR -Pyr adsorption results show that there is a competition between the nature and the strength of t he acidic sites, which directly influences the flame -retardant properties. A better performance is achieved with an excess of Brønsted sites relative to the Lewis ones, whereas moderate -strength sites are preferable to the strong ones, as the latter tend t o impair the flame -retarding properties. It is possible that the swelling process, which is fundamental for decreasing the degradation rate of the inner polymeric matrix, is weakened by the strong acid sites, as they can work as ammonia traps. Furthermore, flammability and FTIR -Pyr adsorption results point towards the necessity of the existence of these Brønsted acidic sites at a key temperature —until 280 oC for the APP -PER system studied in this work —as they take part in the esterification reaction between APP and PER.", "In summary, once the influence of both the strength and the nature of the acidic sites of Mt on the flame retardancy in intumescent composites is better understood, new catalysts can be developed containing the desired properties in order to develop materials with better flame - retarding performance.", "Chapter 3: A study of the acidity of montmorillonites on the thermal degradation and in the cone calorimeter parameters of an intumescent composite", "Abstract This work evaluates the effects of the acidity of montmorillonites on the thermal degradation process and in the cone calorimeter parameters of an intumescent composite constituted by polypropylene, ammonium polyphosphate (APP) and pentaerythritol (PER). T he cone calorimeter tests showed that the absence of moderate -strength acidic sites is related to the increase in the peak of heat release rate (pHRR). The composites were burnt at different key-temperatures and the residues were submitted to Fourier trans form infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and to X -ray diffraction (XRD). The results showed that the addition of the clay minerals is important to preserve the char at higher temperatures (over 430 oC) and that an excess of Brønsted sites over the Lewis ones with moderate strength could lead to the increase of the esterification reactions between PER and APP. Besides, the addition of the clay minerals did not affect the mechanical properties of the composites.", "3.1 INTRODUCTION", "Intumescent flame retardant systems have been studied as an alternative to reduce the inherent flammability of polymeric composites (PAPASPYRIDES; PANTELIS, 2014) . Between the 80´s and the 90´s, important contributions were made regarding the mechanisms involved in these systems by combining thermal analysis, flammability tests and spectroscopic techniques, to enlighten the complex process that leads to intumescenc e (BOURBIGOT et al., 1995, 1996b; CAMINO et al., 1985b; CAMINO; COSTA; MARTINASSO, 1989; CAMINO; COSTA; TROSSARELLI, 1984a, 1984b; DELOBEL et al., 1990) . In summary, an intumescent formulation consists on a mixture of a carbonific agent, an acid source and a blowing agent. A typical intumescent formulation is composed by pentaerythritol (PER) (a polyhydroxylated carbon source) and ammonium polyphosphate (APP), which acts both as the acid source and the blowing agent (BOURBIGOT; LE BRAS; DELOBEL, 1993; CAMINO; COSTA; TROSSARELLI, 1984b) . With the increase of temperature, as in a fire scenario, the polymer starts to melt and the APP decomposes, generating inorganic acids that will react with the hydroxyl groups of PER, generating phosphorous esters, until 280 oC (BOURBIGOT; LE BRAS; DELOBEL, 1993) . With further heating, between 280 and 350 oC, the esters undergo elimination reactions, forming unsaturated compounds which, through Diels -Alder cyclization reactions, produce aromatic compounds that will originate the char (DELOBEL et al., 1990) . Next, ammonia is released from the blowing agent, promoting the swelling of the char (BOURBIGOT; DUQUESNE, 2007b) . The char is a rigid and spongy carbonaceous layer constituted of stacks of condensed aromatic rings, which are more resistant to thermal oxidation. Once formed, the char acts as a physical barrier, protecting the polymeric matrix from the exchange of heat, combustible volatiles and oxygen, ceasing the flame (RIBE IRO et al., 2009) . However, as the temperature increases to values higher than 430 oC, further condensation of the aromatic structures occurs, and the char becomes stiff and prominent to fissures, enabling the transport of flammable gases from the degra dation of the polymeric matrix towards the flame (BOURBIGOT; DUQUESNE, 2007b) .", "Aiming to improve the performance of the intumescent composites, many works studied the incorporation of inorganic synergistic agents, such as zeolites and clays (BOURBIGOT et al., 1996b, 1 996c; CHIGWADA; WILKIE, 2003; ESTEVÃO et al., 2005; HUANG et al., 2014; LECOUVET et al., 2013; RIBEIRO; ESTEVÃO; NASCIMENTO, 2007; TANG et al., 2005) , into the intumescent formulation. In Chapter 2 , a raw montmorillonite was submitted to acidic activati on with sulfuric acid for different times, producing clay mineral samples containing", "acidic sites with different natures (Brønsted or Lewis) and different strengths (weak, moderate and strong). Next, the clay minerals were added to an intumescent formulati on composed by APP and PER using polypropylene as the polymeric matrix. The influence of the nature and the strength of the acidic sites on the synergistic action with the intumescent formulation was then evaluated. Through limit oxygen index (LOI) tests, one of the most relevant quality control used in the polymer industry (PAPASPYRIDES; PANTELIS, 2014) , it was observed that the flame-retarding properties are directly affected by a competition between the nature and the strength of the acidic sites. The best performance was achieved for the composite containing the clay mineral with an excess of Brønsted sites relative to the Lewis on es, with preference to moderate -strength sites to strong ones. In addition, the existence of these sites seems to be crucial for the esterification reaction between APP and PER.", "Therefore, this work aims to evaluate the influence of the acidity of montmor illonites on another important flammability test, the cone calorimeter, a more elaborate medium -sized bench -scale method, through which several fire properties of a material can be determined. Besides, in order to achieve a better understanding of the acti on of montmorillonites acidity in intumescent formulations composed of APP and PER, chemical groups present in the gas and condensed phases, produced during the thermal degradation of the composites, were also evaluated.

The neat PP degrades in two steps, the first one with an abrupt mass loss (94.3%) be tween 260 and 443 oC, followed by a smoother mass loss curve until 550 oC, when PP is completely consumed (LAI et al., 201 5). The addition of the intumescent formulation (PP/IF sample) is responsible for improving the composite thermal stability, as it reduces the mass loss to 68% until 450 oC. As the charred structure begins to form, the curve tends to level up until 550 ◦C, when a second smaller degradation step occurs until 900 ◦C, keeping the mass percentage over 14% until the end of the test ( Table 3.4 ). The mass loss between 250 and 450 oC results from the degradation of the additives and the polymeric matrix, and als o from the reactions responsible for the char formation.

Also, the ammonia released during the APP degradation causes the ch ar to swell (BOURBIGOT; DUQUESNE, 2007b) .

Due to the experimental conditions required to obtain the FTIR spectra in the gas phase (high air flow rate and low heating rate), the features of the TGA curves presented are slightly different from the ones of the previous chapter ( section 2.3.7) , in which the final residue obtained for the composites containing clay is significantly greater (higher than the 3% m/m ratio of added clay) than the one for PP/IF, evidencing the synergistic effect promoted by the clay minerals with the intumescent formulation .

These bands evidence the degradation of the PP into hydrocarbons, which are a significant part of the combustible gases (LAI et al., 2015; WU et al., 2008) .

Furthermore, the increase of all bands intensities is remarkable for the whole samples, evidencing the increase of the concentration of the degrad ation products at the T dTG peak .

For the composites which conserve a high mass percentage at this temperature (between 15 and 20%), this result evidences that their degradation rate w as slowed down due to the formation of thermally stable products (char).

In addition, at this temperature, there is the formation of phospho -carbonaceous structures and of polyaromatic species. The aliphatic chains originated from the thermal degradatio n of the polymeric matrix can also contribute to these structures, by connecting the polyaromatic species that start to be formed, making the structures more flexible (BOURBIGOT; LE BRAS; DELOBEL, 1993) . A good balance between flexibility and rigidity is important in order to support the pressure generated by the ammonia and the volatiles released during the degradation process. It is suggested that, between 350 and 560 oC, the cleavage of the P -O-C bonds from the phospho -carbonaceous structures promotes the condensati on of the polyaromatic structures. This condensation increases the rigidity of the char, affecting its barrier properties, especially at 430 oC (BOURBIGOT; LE BRAS; DELOBEL, 1993) , generating fissures through which the combustible products could escape, feeding the flame.", "In order to evaluate the chemical changes in the condensed phas e along the thermal degradation process, the composites were burnt at key temperatures (280, 350, 430 and 560 oC) and their spectra were recorded ( Figure 3.5a-e).

The PP/IF sample presents a more intense band at 1000 cm- 1 than at 1155 cm-1, while the other samples present both bands (at 1022 and 1180 cm-1) with equivalent intensities. As e xplained above, the P -O-C bond is associated to the flexibility of the intumescent layer and a lower intensity in the related band implies in a more rigid, condensed aromatic structure, leading to the formation of fissures. In fact, for the PP/IF sample, a t 560 oC these bands are not observed anymore, pointing towards the cleavage of the P -O-C bonds and the condensation of the polyaromatic structure. At 430 oC the residue of PP/IF is highly hygroscopic, possibly due to the formation of P 4O10 crystals (BOURBIGOT; LE BRAS; DELOBEL, 1993) , and the O -H stretching band (which appears more cle arly for the other composites at 3458 cm-1) (MCKEE; SPIRO; LAMBY, 1984) from ads orbed water covers the entire spectrum. On the other hand, the residues containing clay mineral were able to maintain those structures until 560 oC, with intense bands at 1180 cm-1, indicating that the addition of the clay minerals avoided the complete cle avage of the P -O-C, favouring the thermal stability of the intumescent layer until 560 oC.", "Another remarkable feature is the weak intensity of the bands at 1022 and 1180 cm-1 (PO 2 and PO 3 in complex carbon -phosphates and P -O-C in phosphate -carbon complexes ) in the", "PP/IF/AH5 spectrum compared to the respective ones of the other composites with clay mineral at 350 oC. Between 280 and 350 oC the formation of double bonds occurs, followed by cyclization reactions that will extend the polyaromatic structure, acc ompanied by the decomposition of the APP and the release of ammonia (BOURBIGOT; DUQUESNE, 2007b) .", "In Chapter 2 , PP/IF/AH5 achieved the highest performance in the LOI test (38%) among all the other composites (35% for PP/IF/ANa and AH2, 33% for PP/IF/K10, 30% for PP/IF/ and 27% for PP/IF/AH20), a result that was justified by the higher ratio of Brønsted/Lewis sites with moderate strength and the absence of strong sites. According to the literature, a higher ratio of Brønsted/Lewis acidic sites promotes a higher esterification co nversion (DILL et al., 2021) . Therefore, it is possible that AH5 leads to a higher efficiency in the esterification, the first step in a sequence of reactions to produce the polyaromatic structures, consuming the APP and leaving a lower content of aliphatic chain s available to form phosphate -carbon complexes, implying in weaker bands at 1022 and 1180 cm-1. PP/IF/AH20 sample, whose clay mineral contains only weak acidic sites, shows the strongest bands at 350 oC, which could imply a lower conversion in the phospha te esters and, consequently, in the polyaromatic structures.", "Wavenumber (cm-1)PP/IF/AH5PP/IF/K10 PP/IF/AH2 PP/IF/ANa PP/IFPP/IF/AH20 Figure 3.5 FTIR spectra of the condensed phase of the composites at (a) room temperature (RT); Wavenumber (cm-1)PP/IF/AH5PP/IF/K10 PP/IF/AH2 PP/IF/ANa PP/IFPP/IF/AH20(c) 350 oC Wavenumber (cm-1)PP/IF/AH5PP/IF/K10 PP/IF/AH2 PP/IF/ANa PP/IFPP/IF/AH20 PP/IF/AH5PP/IF/K10 PP/IF/AH2 PP/IF/ANaTransmittance (a.u.)

The amorphous phase is composed by small polyaromatic mo lecules and alkyl chains produced from the thermal degradation of the additives and the polymeric matrix. The crystalline phase involves macromolecular stacks of polyaromatic structures connected by fragments of alkyl chains and by phosphate groups (BOURBIGOT S., DUQUESNE, 2007) . Figure 3.6a-e presents the changes in the crystallinity of the residues obtained after burning at 280, 350, 430 and 560 oC. From 430 oC, not enough residue of PP/IF could be produced to perform the XRD a nalysis.", "At room temperature (RT; Figure 3.6a), the main reflections present in the samples are related to the PP and APP crystallinity ( Figure 3.7a). From RT to 280 oC (Figure 3.6b), a change in cry stallinity is observed, possibly associated to the beginning of the degradation of the polymeric matrix and the formation of the phosphate -carbon complexes, as discussed in the analysis of the FTIR spectra. At this stage, PP/IF is highly amorphous, differe ntly from the other composites with clay mineral. With further heating, at 350 oC (Figure 3.6c), PP/IF is completely amorphous, whereas the composites w ith clay mineral present a new diffractogram profile, with the main reflections associated to silicon phosphate ( Figure 3.7b). This feature evidences the important role played by the clay minerals in maintaining the char crystallinity and, consequently, its integrity. According to the literature (BOURBIGOT et al., 1996a; BOURBIGOT; DUQUESNE, 2007a; FONTAINE; G ALLOS; BOURBIGOT, 2014; RIBEIRO et al., 2019) , the formation of aluminosilicophosphate complexes is responsible for the improvement of the mechanical properties of the intumescent layer. From 430 oC (Figure 3.6d), not enough residue could be collected from the PP/IF sample (remembering that the samples were submitted to a 15 h -burning), whereas for the other samples the char was preserved. The profile exhibited by the composites with clay mineral at 350 oC is kept until 560 oC (Figure 3.6d-e), only with variations in the reflections’ intensities.", "Therefore, the presence of the clay minerals seems important to preserve the phosphocarbonaceous structures (through P -O-C bonds) and, consequently, to maintain the char structure at higher temperatures, i. e. over 430 oC, and for long -lasting tests .", "PP/IF/AH20 PP/IF/AH5 PP/IF/AH2 PP/IF/ANa PP/IF(b) 280 oC PP/IF/K10 PP/IF/AH20 PP/IF/AH5 PP/IF/AH2 PP/IF/ANaIntensity (a.u.) 2 theta (o)PP/IF(a) RT PP PP/IF/AH20 PP/IF/AH5 PP/IF/AH2 PP/IF/ANa PP/IF(c) 350 oC PP/IF/AH20 PP/IF/AH5 PP/IF/AH2 PP/IF/ANa(d) 430 oC PP/IF/AH20 PP/IF/AH5 PP/IF/AH2 PP/IF/ANa(e) 560 oC Figure 3.6 Diffractograms of (a) PP and the composites at room temperature; and of the composites after burning at (b) 280 oC; (c) 350 oC; (d) 430 oC and (e) 560 oC.", "3.3.6 MECHANICAL PROPERTIE S OF THE COMPOSITES: TENSILE TEST Table 3.6 and Figure 3.8 report the main parameters extracted from the stress versus strain curves ( Figure 3.9).

The nature of the acidic sites of the montmorillonites has not affected the performance of the composites in the CC tests, but the absence of moderate strength sites, as in AH20, reduces the decrease of the pHRR. Also, the TGA -FTIR spectrum of the PP/IF/AH20 sample reveals its poo r ability in slowing down the degradation process at 425 oC (close to the T dTG peak ), as more intense bands of CO and CO 2 were observed at this temperature when compared to the ones of the other composites containing a clay mineral.", "Through MFR tests, it w as possible to observe that the addition of the clay minerals promotes an increase of the viscosity of the molten state of the composites ( i.e. the decrease of the MFR value) relative to that of PP/IF, except for AH20, for which the opposite effect is observed. The increase of the MFR, or the decrease of the viscosity, could raise the transport rate of flammable volatiles, corroborating the cone calorimeter and the TGA -FTIR results. The FTIR analyses of the condensed phase show that the addition of the clay minerals gives rise to bands around 1180 and 1022 cm-1 (related to P -O-C and to PO 2 and PO 3 in complex carbon -phosphates, respectively) until 560 oC. The P -O-C bands are important to the flexibility of the char. At 350 oC, those bands in the PP/IF/AH5 spectrum present the lowest intensities, suggesting a more efficient ester conversion and subsequent cyclization process to produce the polyaromatic structures. This could be associated to the AH5 distinct distribution of ac idic sites, composed of a high ratio of Brønsted/Lewis sites with moderate strength, and the absence of strong acidic sites. For the PP/IF/AH20 sample, whose clay mineral AH20 contains only weak acidic sites, these bands are the most intense among the comp osites at 350 oC, which could suggest a lower efficiency in the esterification reactions. The XRD results reveal that the addition of clay mineral is important to promote the formation of crystalline structures that contribute to the rigidity of the char.", "Finally, the addition of the intumescent formulation is responsible for decreasing the ductility and increasing the rigidity of the composite when compared to those of the neat PP. The addition of clay minerals , even with a high degree of disorganization (as AH20), did not affect significantly the mechanical properties of the composites.", "Chapter 4: Solid State Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MAS NMR)", "This section intends to present the Solid -State NMR results as a complementary information to the Chapte rs 2 and 3. The NMR analyses were performed in order to gain a better understanding of the structure of the intumescent layer as a function of the temperature and under the synergistic action of the raw and acidic -activated montmorillonites . The composit es were submitted to NMR analysis before and after being burned. For the analysis of the composites before burning, the samples were milled in a Fritsch cryogenic mill, model Pulverisette 14 (Fritsch, Idar -Oberstein, Germany). For the analysis of the compo sites after burning, the samples were burnt in a muffle furnace with an air feed during 15 h at 280, 350, 430 and 560 oC and the residues obtained were analysed. As explained in the topic “3.3.4 FTIR spectra of the condensed phase”, these are key -temperatu res to evaluate the chemical changes in the condensed phase along the thermal degradation process.", "Before starting the discussion of these results, it is important to mention that it was not possible to analyze the residues of the composites burnt at 280oC and 350oC due to the exudation of a liquid from these samples which is corrosive to the NMR probe. Those are key - temperatures to the esterification and cyclisation reactions and, due to this technical limitation, an attempt at suggesting a mechanism for t he involved reactions could not be accomplished.

Samples were packed into a 4mm ZrO 2 rotor and stopped with Kel -F caps.

In Figure 4 .1b the signals are ide ntical for all the composites and correspond to those of PP and PER. The signals at 21.9, 26.5, 44.0/ 44.6 ppm are related to the -CH 3, -CH and -CH 2 groups in the PP chain, respectively (BOURBIGO T et al., 1995) .

This is due to the high level of condensation of the polyaromatic structures at this temperature. As in this technique the 1H is excited in order to measure the signal of the 13C, the higher the level of condensation (i. e. the lower the content of 13C-1H bonds), the lower the signal observed. No signals related to aliphati c chains are observed for the composites, which can indicate either the absence of these chains in the sample or a lower content, below the limits of detection of the technique.

This result suggests that the condensation of the polyaromatic structures was not so effective for PP/IF/ANa as it was for the other composites.

In addition, signals in the range -40 to -50 ppm are observed, which are related to phosphoric oxides of the type P 4O10 (cage structure) with different P -O-P bond angles (BOURBIGOT; LE BRAS; DELOBEL, 1993) . It is suggested (BOURBIGOT; LE BRAS; DELOBEL, 1993) that, at this temperature, phosphate species (mainly orthophosphates) recondense to form pyrophosphate and polyphosphate groups. It is also proposed that the P 4O10 crystals could create a stress concentration around them, facilit ating the appearance of cracks and their propagation. This feature could lead to a less efficient char, affecting negatively the flame retarding properties. It is also worth remarking that the composites PP/IF/AH2, PP/IF/AH20 and PP/IF/K10 present the high est peaks in the range -40 to -50 ppm, while the PP/IF/AH5 one presents the lowest peaks. Considering that the APP concentration is the same for all the composites, a higher peak could mean a higher concentration of phosphate groups that did not participat e in the esterification reactions and that therefore contributed to the formation of the P 4O10 type crystals.

The best fire -retardant performance was achieved by using the highest AP concentration (17%) and the lowest ANa concent ration (1.2%), reaching a LOI value of 39%.", "5.1 INTRODUCTION", "Instead of using halogenated composites, an alternative solution for the polymers high flammability is the incorporation of intumescent formulations, which consist of an acid source, a polyhydroxylated carbonaceous compound and a blowing agent. When submit ted to high temperatures, these components react producing an expanded carbonaceous layer (char), which acts as a physical barrier, avoiding the interchange of oxygen, heat and fuel between the material surface and the outside, ceasing the flame (CAMINO; COSTA; MARTINASSO, 1989) .A classical intum escent formulation employed in the literature consists of pentaerythritol (PER) as the polyhydroxylated carbonaceous compound and ammonium polyphosphate (AP), which acts simultaneously as the acid source and the blowing agent (BOURBIGOT; LE BRAS; DELOBEL, 1993; CAMINO; COSTA; TROSSARELLI, 1984b) .", "Intumescent formulations can be u sed in various polymers as polypropylene (ALMERAS et al., 2002a; LECOUVET et al., 2013; Chapter 2 ), polyamides (APAYDIN et al., 2013; BA TISTELLA et al., 2020; FANG et al., 2011) and bio -based polymers (DING et al., 2016; GALLOS; FONTAINE; BOURBIGOT, 2013; GUO et al., 2017b; REGAZZI et al., 2019; VAHABI et al., 2019; WU et al., 2009) . Among the biobased polymers, poly(lactic acid) (PLA), a compostable thermoplastic originated from renewable carbohydrate sources, such as starch and sugarcane (SYPASEUTH et al., 2017) , has shown to be a promising option for many applications (GUO et al., 2017b) . Moreover, some applications need materials with an increased fire resistance. In order to improve the flame retardancy of PLA, some works in literature evaluated the use of expandable graphite (SYPASEUTH et al., 2017; ZHU et al., 2011) , aluminium hydrox ide (NISHIDA et al., 2005) , natural fibers (FOX et al., 2013; SYPASEUTH et al., 2017) and intumescent formulations (RÉTI et al., 2008) . Among these systems, the use of bio -based intumescent formulations with lignin (CARRETIER et al., 2020; CAYLA et al., 2016; RÉTI et al., 2008; ZHANG et al., 201 2), phytic acid (JIN et al., 2017) and starch (RÉTI et al., 2008) have attracted great attention. Ligni n, a residue from the paper and cellulose industry and the second most abundant terrestrial polymer after cellulose, is an attractive candidate to replace PER, as it is a highly cross -linked polyphenolic polymer rich in aliphatic and aromatic carboxylic gr oups (RÉTI et al., 2008; ZHANG et al., 2012) . Besides, due to its aromatic structure and good thermal stability it possesses a high ability for char formation (FERRY et al., 2015) . Réti et al. (2008) evaluated the efficiency of different intumescent formulations – AP/PER, AP/lignin and AP/starch – in a PLA matrix, obtaining a high flame retardancy performance for the biobased composites, with a lower heat release and a higher", "final residue compared to the ones containing AP/PER. Cayla et al. (2016) prepared an intumescent PLA textile containing lignin and AP with remarkable flame -retarding properties. Carretier et al. (2020) observed synergist ic effects on the cone calorimetry tests for PLA/AP/lignin composites when the AP/lignin ratio is up to three.", "In order to enhance the flame -retardant properties, some works in the literature report the use of synergists in the intumescent PLA composition s, such as organo -modified montmorillonite (Cloisite 30B) (FONTAINE; BOURB IGOT, 2009; FONTAINE; GALLOS; BOURBIGOT, 2014; GUO et al., 2017b) , multiwalled carbon nanotubes (FONTAINE; BOURBIGOT, 2009) , expandable graphite (ZHU et al., 2011) and modified layered double hydroxides (JIN et al., 2017) , which exhibited better performances when compared to the correspondent systems without the synergism agent. According to Chapter 2, the addition of a raw montmorillonite – i.e. a non -organomodified montmorillonite – to an intumescent polypropylene composite promotes a synergistic effect with the intumescent formulation (composed by AP and PER), improving the flammability properties. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no study involving the use of raw montmorillonite in an intumescent biobased PLA composite containing ammonium polyphosphate and lignin. Therefore, the aim of this work is to evaluate the impact of AP and montmorillonite on the flame -retardancy of PLA/A P/lignin biocomposites.", "The relative amounts of the materials used to prepare the composites were based upon some assumptions. According to Carretier et al. (2020) , a synergistic effect in the fire performance is observ ed when a ratio of AP/lignin equal or higher than 3 is used in the intumescent formulation, and the best performance is obtained for the composite containing 80% PLA + 17% AP + 3% lignin. From the literature (BOURBIGOT et al., 1996c) , it is known that, for AP/PER systems, the optimum proportion for intumescent systems is 3AP:1PER. In Chapter 2, which evaluated the synergism between AP/PER and montmorillonite in a polypropylene matrix, a 3% of raw montmorillonite synergist was maintained within a proportion of 2.5 PER :1 montmorillonite. For the current PLA/AP/lignin system, in orde r to keep the same proportion, a concentration of 1.2% of montmorillonite should be used for 3% of lignin Therefore, considering all these aspects and keeping the loading around 20% as currently used in the literature for fire -retardant PLA composites (CARRETIER et al ., 2020) , and the lignin concentration constant (3%), a total of six composites were prepared: two of them without montmorillonite (containing 17% and 15.8%AP) and four combining 17% and 15.8 of %AP with 3% and 1.2 % of montmorillonite.", "In order to eval uate the flammability of the composites, they were submitted to cone calorimetry, limiting oxygen index (LOI) and UL -94 vertical burn tests.

The addition of 3% ANa promotes only a slight decrease in the HRR values after the pHRR, levelling off the curves to 200 and 250 kW m-2 until around 300 s of testing. This behavior ca n be related to a poor quality of the formed surface protective layer , which is not able to protect well the polymeric material and to prevent the mass and the heat transfer. Both the PLA/17AP/3ANa and PLA/16AP/3ANa composites present higher THR values tha n their corresponding composites without ANa, indicating that the addition of that amount of montmorillonite is not convenient to improve the fire -retardant properties in the cone calorimeter.

The TTI values do not vary significantly with the addition of ANa.", "The HRR plots in Figure 5.1c clearly show that for the composites containing 1 .2% of ANa there is a sharp decrease in the HRR after the pHRR, followed by a stable plateau (around 125-150 kW m-2 for PLA/17AP/1ANa and 175 -200 kW m-2 for PLA/16AP/1ANa) until 300 s of testing. This behavior indicates that a more resistant surface protective layer could be formed under these conditions, reduci ng the heat and mass transfer. On the other hand, the HRR plots for the composites with 3% of ANa (Figure 5.1b) show a slight reduction of the HRR just after the pHRR , followed a plateau around 200 -250 kW m-2. The increase from 1.2 to 3% of montmorillonite could lead to a more brittle surface layer, favouring the mass transfer with the external environment.

While the PLA thermal degradation occurs in a single step between 300 -370 oC, the composites containing the intumescent formulation exhibit a very different profi le for temperatures above 370 oC, with more than one degradation step. Until 370 oC the mass loss is related to the degradation of the polymeric matrix and the additives: lignin starts to degrade around 230 oC and the ammonium polyphosphate releases ammoni a around 330 oC (CAYLA et al., 2016) . The products of degradation in the condensed phase give rise to more thermally stable products at 370 oC than the neat PLA, leading to a better thermal stability of the material and a greater amount of residue at 900 °C.

The decrease of the mass loss could be related to the formation of more thermally stable products, such as aluminosilicophosphate species (BOURBIGOT; DUQUESNE, 20 07a; RIBEIRO et al., 2019) , due to some interaction between the clay and AP.

A comparison of the PLA spectrum with the ones for the composites containing 15.8% of AP ( Figure 5.5a) and 17% of AP ( Figure 5.5Erro!

This result shows that at 330 oC the neat PLA degrades much faster than the intumescent composites. At 360oC (the temperature of the dTG peak, T dTG peak, Table 5.6), the bands previously observed are intensified ( Figure 5.5c-d) for all the samples, indicating a higher concentration of the degradation products. Besides, new bands are observed, such as the ones at 3017 cm-1 (alkene C -H stretching vibrations) and in the range of 3000 -2740 cm-1 (alkanes C -H stretching vibrations). The narrow band at 1033 cm-1 and the two side bands at 1000 and 1060 cm-1 are assigned to the C -O bond of methanol. The C -O-H bending vibration in alcohols is coupled to H -C-H bending one, producing broad bands in the range of 1440 -1220 cm-1. However, these bands are usually obscured by the strong CH 3 bending band at 1375 cm-1 (PAVIA et al., 2015) (1374 cm-1 in the present case). The formation of carbonyl and alcohol compounds reveals that the degradation process consist s mainly of the breaking of PLA ester bonds. It is also worth noticing that, although the composites spectra present the same bands as the PLA one, their intensity is overall weaker, showing that the degradation process is more intense in the neat PLA tha n in the intumescent composites. In addition, no difference in the products formed or in the intensity of the bands were observed for the composites, indicating that, up to this point (at 360 oC), they all undergo the same thermal degradation process. At 399 oC (Figure 5.5e-f), the PLA is almost completely consumed, justifying the disappearance of some bands in the region of 1260 -1000 cm-1 (methanol at 1033 cm-1) and in the 3000 -2740 cm-1 region (alkanes C -H stretching vibrations), as well as the abruptly reduction in the intensity of the remaining bands. The increase in the thermal stability of the intumescent composites at 399 oC (Figure 5.3) and the lower -intensity bands relative to PLA evidences the formation of the intumescent layer (char), which acts as a physical barrier avoiding the exchange of the volatile products with the external environment.", "At 774 oC (Figure 5.5g-h), PLA is completely consumed (according to Figure 5.3) and no si gnificant bands are observed. For the composites, only the CO 2 related bands are observed with very low intensities. The PLA/17AP/1ANa composite (1.2% of Mt and 17% of AP), which exhibits the highest amount of residual mass among all the samples ( Table 5.6), shows no bands above the baseline, implying that a very effective char protection layer has been formed.", "Wavenumber (cm-1)21732321 1793PLAPLA/17APPLA/17AP/1ANaPLA/17AP/3ANaAbsorbance (a.u.)

According to the literature (BOURBIGOT et al., 1995) , the phosphate species and the phosphocarbonaceous structures possibly formed in the char can be characterized in the wavelength range of 850 to 1350 cm-1. The bands around 886 cm-1 are assigned to the asymmetric vibration of the P -O bond of a P -O-P chain (BOURBIGOT et al., 1995; CHEN et al., 2017; ZHAN et al., 2009) , while the ones ar ound 997 cm-1 are referred to the symmetric axial deformation of PO 2 and PO 3 in complex carbon phosphates (BOURBIGOT et al., 1995; RIBEIRO et al., 2013) .

The band around 1635 cm-1 is assigned to C=C stretching vibrations, indicating the formation of unsaturated compounds. These P -O-C and C=C bonds are typical of systems containing an intumescent formulation as they provide a chemical evidence of the intumescent layer formation.

While PLA/ 16AP and PLA/17AP present an amorphous residue, the ones of the composites containing the ANa clay present a high crystallinity, exhibiting the characteristic reflections of silicon phosphate (SiP 2O7). This is an indicative of the interaction between ANa ( the only source of Si) and ammonium polyphosphate (the only source of P). Only the intensity of the reflections varies among the diffractograms. The composites containing 1.2% of ANa present lower intensity than the ones with 3% of ANa. The higher intensity in the XRD reflection is associated to a higher degree of organization of the crystalline species.

The PLA/ 16AP composite presents a rough and rugged surface, with many holes and fractures. Compared to PLA/16AP, the addition of 1.2% of ANa as in PLA/16AP/1ANa seems to improve the integrity of the char, as there is a significant reduction of fissures and holes. However, increasing the % ANa to 3% did not contribute to the char quality, as the surface presents larger holes and fractures which could entail brittleness.", "The PLA/17AP surface is less rough and more homogeneous than the one of PLA/16AP, with fewer and smaller holes and cracks. After the addition of 1.2% ANa , as in PLA/17AP/1ANa , fewer fractures are observed. PLA/17AP/3ANa shows the poorest quality char, with more fractures and holes, when compared to PLA/17AP and to PLA/17AP/1ANa. According Figure 5.8c, the inner surface of the char has a spongy structure for all of the composites. This aspect is due to the release of gases produced during the reactio ns of the intumescent formulation and the degradation of the polymeric matrix. Composites without clay present larger pores in their inner surfaces when compared to the composites with clay. Moreover, the pores seem better distributed and more homogeneous in size for the composites with 1.2% of montmorillonite than for the ones with 3%. Again, PLA/17AP/1ANa presents a particular structure, with better structured and spongier pores than the other composites, probably because there are gas bubbles trapped within its pores. The better structured char presented by the composites with 1.2% of ANa in comparison to the ones with 3% can explain the differences in the curve profiles obtained in the cone calorimeter t est.

According to the cone calorimeter results, the curve profiles depend on the concentration of montmorillonite, with a sharp reduction of the pHRR with 1.2% of clay and a slight decrease, followed by a plateau, when 3% of clay is added.

Raising the % montmorillonite to 3% seems detrimental to the fire behaviour as the composite presents a higher THR value, a poor structured char, as well as an inferior thermal stability when compared to the composites containing 1.2% montmorillonite.

A raw (ANa) and two acidic -activated (AH2 and AH5) montmorillonites were added to the intumescent formulation, composed by lignin and ammonium polyphosphate, in order to evaluate the influence of the strength and the nature (Brønsted or Lewis) of their acidic sites on the fire behaviour of the composites. The thermal stability and the v olatile thermal degradation products of the composites were assessed. The injected and 3D -printed composites were submitted to cone calorimeter, limit oxygen index (LOI) and UL -94 flammability tests. A similar tendency was observed for the injected and 3D - printed samples. The high density of strong Lewis sites in AH2 showed to be detrimental to the fire-retarding properties. The best performance in the flammability tests was achieved by the composites containing clays with only weak and moderate strength ac idic sites (ANa and AH5).", "6.1 INTRODUCTION", "Additive manufacturing, most commonly known as three -dimensional (3D) printing, is a growing technique for the development of advanced materials, especially for polymers, due to their easy processability, versatility of applications (such as in health and aerospace domains) and possibility to manufacture complex -shaped materials with a low cost (VAHABI et al., 2021) . Among the various techniques of additive manufacturing, the fused filament fabrication (FFF), usually applie d for low -temperatures polymers (VAHABI et al., 2021) , is well -known due to its simplicity, high -speed and low -cost. The FFF technique is able to create 3D objects through the deposition, layer by layer, of a molten mat erial filament through movements in the X-Y plane over a movable plate. As soon as the first layer deposition is finished, the plate moves downward (in the Z axis) and a new layer is added (RAJPUROHIT; DAVE, 2018) . This process is repeated until the completion of the designed object.", "A recent and challenging domain of application of the additive manufacturing is in the production of flame -retarding materials, enabling the conception of advanced, new -designed and l ow-cost products (PAGANIN; BARBOSA, 2020) . Some polymeric matrix, such as poly(amide) 6 (PA6), poly(lactic acid) (PLA) and acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) have already been tested for the production of fire -retarding composites through t he FFF technique (BABU et al., 2021) . Despite the increasing economic importance of the additive manufacturing in the worldwide market (CICALA et al., 2018) and the growing interest in using bio -based materials, only a few works developed 3D -printed intumesc ent flame -retarding PLA composites by FFF (VAHABI et al., 2021) . Guo et al. (GUO et al., 2017b) produced intumescent PLA nanocomposites with melamine polyphosphate and Cloisite 30B by FFF and hot press moulding. Regazzi et al. (REGAZZI et al., 2019) made use of FFF and injection to study different formulations of flame -retarded PLA containing ammonium polyphosphate, melamine cyanurate and phyll osilicates (Cloisite 30 -B and sepiolite). Xue et al. (XUE et al., 2020) developed a flame -retardant PLA composite with the addition of ammonium polyphosphate and resorcinol bis(diphenyl phosphate), by FFF and hot press moulding. The productio n of an intumescent flame -retardant composite consists of adding an intumescent formulation, composed by an acid source, a blowing agent and a carbonific agent, to a polymeric matrix during the processing step. A conventional system in the literature (BOURBIGOT; LE BRAS; DELOBEL, 1993; CAMINO; COSTA; TROSSARELLI, 1984b) consists o f pentaerythritol (PER) as the carbon source and ammonium polyphosphate (AP) as both the blowing agent and acid source. There are two possible mechanisms proposed in the", "literature for the initial reactions which would take place as the temperature increas es up to 280 oC: according to the first (CAMIN O et al., 1985a) one, a direct reaction occurs between AP and PER, producing phosphate esters, while the second one (BOURBIGOT; LE BRAS; DELOBEL, 1993) considers that, instead of a direct reaction, the AP decomposes producing acidic species such as pyrophosphates and phosphoric acid, which would then react with the PER, giving rise t o phosphate esters. Over 280 oC and under 350 oC, the degradation of the phosphate esters produces unsaturated species, which then undergo Diels -Alder reactions (DELOBEL et al., 1990) , leading to a layered structure, called char, composed of condensed aromatic rings bounded to each other by phosphates species (BOURBIGOT; LE BRAS; DELOBEL, 1993) . In that temperature range, the volatile products originated from the AP decomposition causes the swelling of the char, creating a rigid, intumes cent layer that acts as a barrier between the material and the external environment, inhibiting the exchange of the combustible volatile products (fuel), heat (thermal energy) and oxygen (oxidizing agent), ceasing the flame.", "Many works in the literature seek to develop more efficient systems by adding aluminosilicate synergistic agents, such as zeolites (BOURBIGOT et al., 1996b, 1996c; ESTEVÃO et al., 2005) and clays (CHIGWADA; WILKIE, 2003; HUANG et al., 2014; LECOUVET et al., 2013; RIBEIRO; ESTEVÃO; NASCIMENTO, 2007; TANG et al., 2005) , to the intumescent formulations. Overall, the authors address the synergic effects observed in the formation of aluminophosphate species (BOURBIGOT; DUQUESNE, 2007b; FONTAINE; GALLOS; BOURBIGOT, 2014; RIBEIRO et al., 2019) that would connect the layers of condensed aromatic rings, enha ncing the char flexibility during the swelling process, consequently minimizing the generation of cracks and holes, which are major drawbacks for the efficiency of the intumescent layer at higher temperatures (BOURBIGOT; LE BRAS; DELOBEL, 1993; LECOUVET et al., 2013) . Also, the addition of mineral fillers reduces the total amount o f combustible material and the rate of diffusion of oxygen into the polymer, by forming an inorganic barrier on the surface of the burning polymer, protecting it from the external heat source (BATISTELLA et al., 2018) .", "Nevertheless, only few works investigated the influence of the acidity of synergistic agents on the flame -retarding properties of intumescent composite s (BERNARDES et al., 2019; MARTINS et al., 2020 [Chapter 2]; RIBEIRO et al., 2019, 2020; TANG et al., 2004; ZANETTI et al., 2001) . Montmorillonites are well -known catalysts for esterification reactions in organic liquid media and many works try to correlate a better catalytic performance to the presence of Brønsted acidic sites (DILL et al., 2021; KOMADEL et al., 1997; REDDY e t al., 2009;", "ZACCHERIA et al., 2018) . Furthermore, montmorillonite (Mt) presents some favourable features: it exhibits swelling properties, cation exchange capacity (JHA et al., 2013) and its surface acidity can be modified through an acidic activation (TYAGI; CHUDASAMA; JASRA, 2006) . Dill et al. (DILL et al., 2021) performed methyl esterification reactions between methanol and carboxylic acids ( acetic and lauric acids) catalysed by acid -activated smectites with a high content of Mt. They found that the higher the ratio of Brønsted/Lewis acidic sites, the higher the esterification conversion achieved. The authors attribute this result to the small er size of the proton (Brønsted acid sites) compared to the Lewis acid sites, which facilitates the protonation of the oxygen of the carbonyl group of the carboxylic acid, favouring the nucleophilic attack by methanol. The study carried out in Chapter 2 revealed the influence of the strength and the nature of the montmorillonite acid sites on the flame -retarding propert ies of a composite made of polypropylene , AP, PER and acidic activated Mt. A better performance in the flammability tests was achieved by th e composites containing montmorillonites with an excess of Brønsted sites relative to the Lewis ones, and preferentially with moderate -strength sites relative to the strong ones. The presence of the Brønsted acidic sites is fundamental until 280 oC, when e sterification reactions between AP and PER start to occur. The conclusions of Dill et al (DILL et al., 2021) corroborates the results obtained in Chapter 2.", "The current society demand for more sustainable materials inspirited the search for bio - based and biodegradable materials in order to replace the commonly used originated from the oil industry. Some works seek to replace the components of the intumescent f ormulation by more sustainable ones, such as starch (RÉTI et al., 2008) , tannic acid (LAOUTID et al., 2018b, 2018a) , chitosan (CHEN et al., 2017) and lignin (CARRETIER et al. , 2020; FERRY et al., 2015) . Among them, lignin presents particular interest for being a residue from the paper industry (GORDOBIL et al., 2015) , as well as for its good thermal stability and aromatic chemical structure, resulting in a high ability for char formation (FERRY et al., 2015) . Also, many efforts have been made in the intumescent polymeric composites domain in order to replace the olefin polymers by bio -based ones, such as poly(3 -hydroxybutyrate) (PHB) (VAHABI et al., 2019) , polybutylene succinate (PBS) (FERRY et al., 2015) and poly(lactic acid) (PLA) (FONTAINE; BOURBIGOT, 2009; FOX et al., 2013; SYPASEUTH et al., 2017; ZHU et al., 2011) . Amidst the bio -based polymers, PLA presents some competitive advantage such as: a low em ission of greenhouse gases during degradation, less energy is required for its production (BAX; MÜSSIG, 2008) , it is compostable (KARAMANLIOGLU; PREZIOSI; ROBSON, 2017) , it comes from renewable sources, it is a high -strength and high -modulus thermoplastic and it is easily processable (BAX; MÜSSIG, 2008) .", "This work aims to investigate the influence of Brønsted and Lewis acidity of acidic - activated montmorillonites on the flame -retardancy and mechanical properties of intumescent bio-based composites produced by both injection moulding and FFF techniques.

All the mass loss curves ( Figure 6.1a) are overlapped along the main degradation step until around 370 oC with similar values for the onset temperature (T onset) and for the temperature at dTG peaks (TdTG peak ), as shown in Table 6.4. This step is associated to the degradation of the polymeric matrix as well as to the beginning of the lignin degradation and the release of ammonia (CAYLA et al., 2016) . The neat PLA presents a single degradation step, and it is completely consumed up at 550 oC, whereas the composites containing the intumescent formulation present more than one degradation step, with more therma lly stable products being produced at 370 oC, promoting a significant decrease of the mass loss ratio when compared to the neat PLA. Despite of the very similar profiles of the composites’ curves, different percentages of the remaining residue are obtaine d for each one. The sole addition of ammonium polyphosphate and lignin to PLA is responsible for rising the final experimental", "residue from 0 to 7.4% in PLA/AP/Lig (see Table 6.4). This increase in residue can be attributed to the thermal decomposition of ammonium polyphosphate, which produces phosphoric acid and catalyses the crosslinking between APP and lignin, with the formation of thermally stable prod ucts (LI; ZHANG; SU, 2002) .", "Table 6.4 Data for TGA and dTG curves for PLA and the composites produced.", "The addition of ANa and AH5 contributes to the increase in the final residue, of 65% for the composite with ANa and of 28% for the one with AH5 when compared to PLA/AP/Lig. This increase of the final residue could be related to the enhancement of the therm al stability, which might be attributed to the interaction between ammonium polyphosphate and clay which can lead to the formation of aluminophosphate species (BOURBIGOT; DUQUESNE, 2007a; RIBEIRO et al., 2019) . Moreover, the mass difference of 1.2% between the final residues of PLA/AP/Lig/AH2 and PLA/AP/Lig, corresponds to the amount of AH2 added to the composite (see Table 6 .2). Therefore, it seems that the time of the acidification has an important influence on the final residue of the samples. The AH5 and AH2 clays have a similar distribution of moderate strength sites, but the presence of strong Lewis acidic site s in AH2 can slow down the kinetics of the esterification reactions, giving rise to a less thermally stable char.

As the theoretical curves for PLA/AP/Lig/ANa, PLA/AP/Lig/AH2 and PLA/AP/Lig/AH5 are identical (i.e., their curves are superimposable as they present the same profile and the same amount of final residue), only the one for AH5 was chosen for comparison in Figure 6.2. The theoretical curves for PLA/AP/Lig and PLA/AP/Lig/clay present ident ical profiles, differing only in the amount of final residue at 900 oC (5.3% for PLA/AP/Lig and 6.4% for PLA/AP/Lig/clay, see Table 6.4). All the experi mental curves show a larger percentage of final residue than the theoretical ones, revealing that the better thermal stability of the composites is a result of positive interactions between the components, and not only of a sum of individual effects. This interaction becomes more evident between 650 and 900 oC, a region where the theoretical curves show a more pronounced reduction in the thermal stability. Consequently, the experimental curves reach a higher percentage of final residue when compared to the predicted theoretically. For the composite without clay, PLA/AP/Lig, the final experimental residue is 40% higher than the predicted one. For the composites with clay the final experimental residues are higher than the predicted ones by 34%, 48% and 91% fo r PLA/AP/AH2, PLA/AP/Lig/AH5 and for PLA/AP/Lig/ANa, respectively.", "Temperature (°C) PLA/AP/Lig PLA/AP/Lig/ANa PLA/AP/Lig/AH2 PLA/AP/Lig/AH5 PLA/AP/Lig_theo PLA/AP/Lig/AH5_theo Figure 6.2 Theoretical and experimental mass loss curves for the composites.", "6.3.1.1 Gas phase analysis of the volatile thermal degradation products", "through FTIR Figure 6.3 displays the absorption spectra of the volatile species released during the degradation of the neat PLA and of the composites at different temperatures along the degradation process. The temperatures have been selected according to the TGA and dTG data (Table 6.4): 330 oC (close to T onset), 360 oC (close to T dTG peaks ), 500 oC (along the thermal stabilization of the composites curves) and 860 oC (close to the end of the TGA test). The PLA degradation process consists of a combination of a hydrolytic degradation (by cleavage of the esters groups, producing oligomers and monomers) and a thermal degradation (by chain scission and inter or intra t rans-esterification reactions) (GORRASI; PANTANI, 2017) . The hydrolytic degradation is strongly influenced by the temperature, which tends to accelerate it, and by the acidity. In an acidic medium, the hydrolysis of the ester bonds is catalysed by protons, producing low molecular weight oligomers, which are water soluble (GORRASI; PANTANI, 2017) . Table 6.5 summarizes the assignments of the absorption bands. At 330 oC (T onset, Figure 6.3a), the PLA degradation produces CO 2 (2359, 2321 and 668 cm-1) and CO ( maximum at 2173 cm-1 for the R branch and maximum at 2107 cm-1 for the P branch of the fundamental absorption band ). The band at 1793 cm-1 is associated to the gas phase carbonyl band of lactic acid (“Lactic acid”, 2018) , which is an expected product from the P LA hydrolysis (GORRASI; PANTANI, 2017; INKINEN et al., 2011) . The bands present in the 1300 -1000 cm-1 range can be associated to the C -O stretching vibrations in esters and alcohols. At that temperature, only the composite without clay (PLA/AP/Lig) presents some significant bands (of CO 2) besides the ones of PLA, indicating that the presence of clay slows down the release of volatile degradation products up to 330 oC.", "Close to T dTG peaks (360 oC, Figure 6.3b), the concentration of the degradation products of PLA increases, what can be inferred from the higher intensity of the corresponding bands. Furthermore, other volatile species are produced, as evidenced by new bands that can be assigned to alkene C -H stretching vibrations (3017 cm-1), alkane C -H stretching vibrations cm-1). The respective bands in all the composites show practically the same intensities but always low er than the respective ones in the neat PLA. The presence of the same volatile products in the neat PLA and in the composites evidences that they have all experienced the same thermal degradation process, which mainly consists of the breaking of the PLA es ter bonds, leading to the formation of alcohol and carbonyl species. The lower intensity of the", "bands observed for the composites reveals that the intumescent formulation plays an important role in retarding the degradation process. At 500 oC (Figure 6.3c), the decrease in the intensity of the bands and the disappearance of a great number of them are remarkable. For the neat PLA these effects are clearly due to the low amount of remaining polymer, almost completely consumed at this temperature. For t he composites, this reduction can be attributed to the formation of thermally stable products (char), as they still conserve a high mass percentage at this temperature (see Figure 6.1a). PLA/AP/Lig, which does not contain any clay, presents the highest CO 2 band intensity, followed by PLA/AP/Lig/AH2 and PLA/Lig/AH5, in a descending order of intensity.

In contrast, the bands are completely absent in the PLA/AP/Lig/ANa composite which also exhibits the highest mass percentage at that temperature.

The addition of AH2 did not show any improvements when compared to the other clays, as its pHRR values remained very close to the ones of the composite without clay, PLA/AP/Lig.

For the composites containing AH2 (Figure 6.6c) the HRR curve of the 3D -printed sample presents a more intense second peak (associated to the degradation of the char layer), around 250 s. This behavior might be related to the formation of a more frag ile and less efficient char for the 3D -printed sample, unable to retain the volatile combustible products. The porosity created during the FFF printing and the consequent reduction of the sample density could be the reason for this fragility (REGAZZI et al., 2019) , promoting the exchange of oxygen and combustible volatiles between the internal and external parts of the char.

PLA presents the highest yield strength and strength at break values but, at the same time, the lowest elongation at break and modulus values, making it more fragile and less rigid than the injected composites. The addition of the intumescent formulation and of the intumescent formulation containing clay increased the ductility and the rigidity, as evidenced by the higher values of the elongation at bre ak and the Young’s modulus. Among the composites, a higher ductility was observed for the PLA/AP/Lig one (due to its higher elongation at break value) in comparison to the composites with clay.

The addition of the AH2 clay, which contains strong acidic sites, mostly Lewis` ones, does not contribute to the thermal stability of the composite. Nevertheless, the addition of ANa and AH5, which do not present strong acidic sites, only weak and moderate strength ones, is responsible for a further enhancement of the composites thermal stability. The cone calorimeter tests reveal that the use of AH2 is not advantageous for the flame - retarding properties of the composite, and that the composites containing ANa and AH5 present the best performances. T his difference of behaviour can be explained by the lack of strong acidic sites in ANa and in AH5 and the presence of weak and moderate strength ones. The strong sites present in AH2, mostly of the Lewis type, can compromise the esterification kinetics and , consequently, impair the cyclization reactions, as evidenced by the presence of a remarkable narrow band at 1401 cm-1 (CH 2 bending absorption) in the FTIR spectrum of the cone calorimeter residue. The same CC test behaviour is observed for the injected a nd the 3D - printed samples.", "Neat PLA did not classify in UL -94 test, while all the injected and 3D -printed composites achieved a V -2 classification. For both processing methods (injection and FFF), the LOI tests indicate a significant enhancement of the fir e behaviour with the addition of the intumescent formulation AP/Lig. An even better performance was reached by the composites containing clay, the highest LOI values being achieved by the PLA/AP/Lig/ANa and PLA/AP/Lig/AH5 composites.", "The flammability resu lts evidence that the strong acidic sites composed mostly by the Lewis type are detrimental for the fire -retarding properties. Conversely, the absence of these sites and the presence of moderate strength ones enhance the fire behaviour. A similar behaviour was observed both in cone calorimeter and LOI tests for the clay -containing samples submitted to injection and FFF, showing that the influence of the montmorillonite acidity is independent of the processing technique. The samples containing AH2, with stro ng Lewis sites, presented the worst performance, while the ones with ANa and AH5 (which do not contain strong acidic sites, but a more homogeneous distribution of Brønsted and Lewis with moderate strength sites) achieved the best results.", "Overall, this wo rk brings out a new insight on the influence of montmorillonite as a synergistic agent in a bio -based intumescent composite, promoting a deeper comprehension of the chemistry behind the intumescence process and, consequently, enabling the development of mo re efficient flame -retarding composites.", "General conclusions This Thesis focused on the study the influence of the strength and the nature (Brønsted and Lewis) of the acidic sites of raw and acidic -activated Mt on the flame -retarding properties of intume scent composites. The results of our studies contribute to a better comprehension of the complex chemistry behind the flame -retardancy of intumescent polymeric composites, as well as to the development of an unprecedented bio -based material with flame reta rdant properties and able to be 3D -printed by fused filament fabrication (FFF). The main conclusions can be divided in two parts, as following.", "Part I The concentration, strength and nature of the acidic sites of the montmorillonites were efficiently modified by the process of acidic activation. The addition of the clay minerals to the intumescent composites is responsible for the enhancement of the intumescent layer´s thermal stability, leading to an increase of the final residue and of the char degradat ion temperature regardless of the nature and the strength of the acidic sites. Despite the fact that the nature of the acidic sites has not influenced the performance of the composites in the cone calorimeter tests, their strength plays an important role, as the presence of moderate strength sites is important to reduce the pHRR.", "The main difference in the flame -retarding performance among the composites was observed in the LOI test, in which the PP/IF composite achieved 30 LOI units, whereas this value ra ised to 33 (for K10), 35 (for ANa and AH2), 38 (for AH5) and decreased to 27 for the AH20 one. These results suggest a competition between the nature and the strength of the acidic sites, as a better performance in the LOI test is achieved with an excess o f Brønsted sites relative to the Lewis ones, preferably for moderate -strength to the strong ones, the latter appearing to impair the flame -retarding properties. In addition, the existence of the Brønsted acidic sites at a key temperature —until 280 ◦C for t he APP -PER- system seems fundamental for the fire - retarding performance of the composites, as those sites participate in the esterification reaction between APP and PER that occurs at this temperature. According to the FTIR analyses, a higher ratio of Brøn sted/Lewis sites with moderate strength, and the absence of strong acidic sites (as in AH5) could lead to a more efficient ester conversion and subsequent cyclization process to produce the polyaromatic structures, whereas the absence of those sites (as in AH20) could be", "responsible for a lower efficiency in the esterification reactions between APP and PER, impairing the char formation.", "Part II Firstly, a study was conducted in order to evaluate the impact of the concentration of ammonium polyphosphate (15 .8% or 17%) and montmorillonite (1.2% or 3%) on the flame - retardancy of PLA/AP/lignin composites. Considering TGA, LOI and cone calorimeter results, the composite containing the highest concentration of ammonium polyphosphate (17%) and the lowest montmorillonite concentration (1.2%) exhibits the best performance, as it combines the most thermally stable products in the TGA to the highest LOI value and the greatest reduction of the pHRR in the CC test, as well as a well -structu red char with the highest amount of residue. Therefore, those proportions were used for the preparation of the composites containing the other acidic -activated clays, AH2 and AH5, by both the injection and FFF techniques. Regarding the cone calorimeter an d LOI tests, a similar behaviour was observed for the injected and the 3D -printes composites. The samples containing AH2 - which contains strong acidic sites, mostly Lewis` ones - presented the worst performance. The samples with ANa and AH5 - which do no t contain strong acidic sites, but a more homogeneous distribution of Brønsted and Lewis with moderate strength sites – shows the best performances. The release of carboxylated products during the thermal degradation of PLA could contribute as an extra Brønsted acid source to the esterification reactions that give rise to the char formation, explaining the similar results achieved by the composites containing ANa and AH5. This similar behaviour was not observed for the system PP/APP -PER (Chapter 2), as the thermal degradation of PP do es not produce species with Brønsted acidity. The FTIR results suggests that the strong sites present in AH2 can compromise the esterification kinetics between APP and lignin or APP and the carboxylated products during the therm al degradation of PLA, impairing the cyclization reactions that lead to char.", "Suggestions Some ideas that arose along this Thesis are presented below, aiming to inspire future research projects that can contribute to ta better comprehension of the complex chemistry behind the flame -retardancy of intumescent polymeric composites.", "1.

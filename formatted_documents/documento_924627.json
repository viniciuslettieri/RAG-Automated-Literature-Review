Dividend -yield variation as a predictor in momentum strategies: analysis of Brazilian REIT s. 2021. 35 pp. Thesis (Master in Business Administration) – Instituto COPPEAD de Administração, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, 2022.", "This paper proposes the use of the dividend -yield (DY) variation as a selection criterion of Brazilian real estate investment trusts (BR-REITs) to form winn er and los er portfolios in subsequent periods. It was shown that strategies around the moment um effect that buy (sell) the BR-REITs that had greater (smaller) variations in the DY in previous months tended to have a superior (inferior) performance to the market in the following months. This result is maintained even when transaction costs and taxes are considered. From this, we suggest with empirical evidence and theoretical arguments that the variation of the DY as a predictor allows the apprehension of market inefficiencies originated by behavioral and non -rationalizable factors. Consistent with the applicable theoretical basis, these effects tend to dissipate in the long term, given that the momentum factor is dynamic and lin ked to the short -term of the asset under consideration. The fact that the factor is also present in the los er tail allows the elaboration of different strategies not only long, but also short, long -biased , and long -short, producing portfolios with differen t risk profiles and potential return. This article will be of interest to investors in general and, more specifically, to institutional investors and portfolio managers who operate funds of funds (FoFs) of BR-REITs . The results found in this paper are rele vant and unprecedented in the related BR-REITs literature.", "Keywords: real estate investment trust, REIT , momentum , predictability , dividend -yield.", "LIST OF TABLES", "LIST OF ABREVIATIONS", "B3 BR-REIT s CDI CVM DY IBOVESPA IFIX L REIT s SR W Brasil , Bolsa, Balcão : Brazilian stock exchange Brazilian real estate investment trust s / Fundos de investimentos imobiliários Brazilian interbank deposit rate Brazilian securities exchange commission Dividend -yield ratio Brazilian stock index Brazilian real estate investment trusts index Portfolio composed of loser s (BR-REIT s) Real estate investment trusts Sharpe ratio Portfolio composed of winner s (BR-REIT s)", "Summary", "1 INTRODUCTION", "According to B3 (202 1), Brazilian REIT s (BR-REIT s) are classified as a market segment constituted at its most by individual investors, rather than institutional ones . This can be observed when both traded volume and value of the assets under custody are analyzed for each kind of investor .", "This market evolved sharply in the last decade, having grown its number of investors almost 100 times , and having improved its regulatory framework with several new legislation s. One specific issue that has changed is that from 2020 since it became possible to short BR -REIT s at B3, the main and only stock exchange in Brazil. Due to reasons as such the prevalence of individual investors , the new regulatory framework and the short living of this market segment , BR-REIT s constitute a good asset class to research for signs of market inefficiencies , such as momentum and reversals, described by Jegadeesh and Titman (1993) .", "So, the main contribution of this work is showing that for BR -REIT s, the dividend -yield ratio (DY) variation showed to be a very good way to segregate between next-time winners and losers in momentum strategies . This is different from the general momentum theory, which utilizes past returns or other performance measures as selection criteri a. Between 2012 and 2020 winner and loser BR-REITs were ranked based on the variation of their dividend -yields. From that, portfolios composed of winners and losers were formed with different sizes (number of constituents) and formation periods ( interval of months in which the selection criterion is evaluated). The portfolios composed of winners (losers) showed superior (inferior) performance to the market when measured by SR (Sharpe ratio). Complementarily, it was possible to develop long, short, long -short, and long -biased strategies . These strategies , that involved buying portfolios composed of winner s and/or sell ing the ones composed of loser s, presented superior performance to the market when measured both by their excess return s and Jensen’s alpha s. Therefore , results showed consistent evidence that DY variation may be a useful predictor in BR -REITs’ market. This holds also when transaction costs and taxes are considered .", "To the best of our knowledge, the usage of the DY variation as the selection criterion for portfolio formation in BR -REIT s is a completely new finding in the related literature . What motivates this is that the DY is a measure of the relative price of BR -REIT s, meaning that an investor buys the yield as a proxy for the expected return of the asset , taking on risks of price and dividend variations. As a consequence, the related literature provide evidence that the DY", "is an important measure of performance for this asset class . Its variation , in turn, may present some irregularities in risk -return dynamics that the variable in level cannot.", "Beyond that , the analysis showed that strategies that use portfolios formed with longer formation periods present inferior performance than the ones that use portfolios formed with shorter formation periods. This indicate s that these effects are majorly seized in the short term , as predicted by the momentum effect theory . Since behavioral anomalies would also tend to exist only in the short term, it is possible to suggest, based on the behavioral literature , that these inefficiencies occur possibly because of such anomalies .", "There are some theoretical explanations for that base d on the literature. Underreaction, for instance, may prevent investors from fully incorporating higher dividend payments to prices. On the other hand, overreaction may cause prices to plunge when there is bad news from the market that is not explained by respective dividends decreases. Since prices tend to go back to their f undamentals, this may explain why DY variation may be able to anticipate higher returns, as shown in the present study.", "Since the Brazilian literature has mostly focused on seeking risk -based explanations for changes in returns of BR -REIT s, the contribution of this work is specifically addressing the asset class in the light of momentum effect . Furthermore, t his is important because stocks have been prioritized in the Brazilian financ e literature in general and the space occupied by BR -REIT s research has been little. The evaluation of the market inefficiencies presented in this paper for BR-REIT s is new in the Brazilian finance literature and may open a fruitful path. Finally, t he fact that the strategies analyzed generated substantial returns in comparison to the market portfolio is of extreme importance not only to fund managers, but also to unsophisticated investor s. The strategies analyzed are of simple elaboration and made use of variables available to any investor, making its adoption possible by almost any kind of investor , let alone institutional and professional investors .", "2 LITERATURE REVIEW", "2.1 Momentum effect", "An important strategy developed in the finance literature is that based on the momentum factor , which consists of forecasting future returns in the short -term based on the recent past performance of an asset. In their seminal paper, Jegadeesh and Titman (1993) demonstrate the formation of winner and loser portfolios bas ed on past returns. By buying winner portfolios and selling the loser ones, they find significantly positive returns that could not be explained by risk exposure. They also find evidence that portfolios formed under the past return criterion tend to have t heir returns dissipated and reversed after 12 months. This finding contradicts the efficient market hypothesis . Therefore several explanations on the nature of this phenomenon have been considered in the literature.", "Thus, challenging the hypothesis of efficient markets developed by Fama (1970), the former authors propose that some factors to which investors are subjected can explain the existence of momentum and rev ersals. They hypothesize that the concepts of underreaction and overreaction can explain the existence of momentum and reversals, respectively.", "Underreaction is an emotional response from investors that prevents them from fully incorporating new information into asset prices. According to the model developed by Barberis, Shleifer, and Vishny (1998) , it occurs due to inv estor conservatism, which consists of resistance to changing beliefs in the face of new information. Thus, positive news about a given asset tends to have its financial effects gradually attributed to prices. From this, opportunities arise to obtain return s with the creation of strategies that seek to find assets which information on profitability has not been completely assimilated by investors.", "Overreaction, in turn, generates reversals because it is an emotional response from investors that encourages sa les of assets exaggeratedly . The model developed by Barberis, Shleifer, and Vishny (1998) presents the representativeness heuristic, which means that investors expect the patterns in small samples to be similar to the parent pop ulation and to reflect the process that builds it, such as investor sentiment that explains the overreaction. In this way, dramatic or substantially negative information can lead an investor to an exaggerated and generalized reaction, without technical fou ndations. This may cause the sale of underpriced assets. From this, opportunities arise to obtain returns with the creation of strategies that seek to find assets that are underpriced and, therefore, subject to reversals.", "Other explanations for momentum an d reversals are found in Hong and Stein (1999) , who adopt the speed of information diffusion among investors, which they consider to be low, as an explanation for of momentum. This indicates that underreaction causes momentum. In ad dition, they consider in their model the existence of momentum investors, who, looking for trends, in the long run , impose pressure on prices, leading to a deviation from fundamentals and overpricing. This indicates overreaction and reversals when prices a djust. Daniel, Hirshleifer, and Subrahmanyam (1998) contradict the scheme of underreaction causing momentum and overreaction causing reversal. According to them, overreaction causes momentum based on investors' overconfidence. Their model shows that overreaction to information can turn into continuing over reaction if future public information confirms investor beliefs. Theories that explain the occurrence of momentum and reversals and the empirical identification of these effect s are extensive in the international finance literature. In Brazil, empirical st udies on the effect on the stock market predominate. Civiletti, Campani & Roquete (2020) find the persistence of returns when using strategies structured around the momentum effect in Brazilian stocks. They analyze 64 portfolio s composed of winners and losers and find representative evidence that the Brazilian stock market is subject to the existence of the momentum effect. Carneiro and Leal (2017) analyze asset selection criteria such as past returns , SR, DY, and liquidity to assess the past performance of Brazilian stocks. By preparing equally weighted portfolios based on these criteria, they obtain significantly higher returns than the IBOVESPA index and equity funds. Thus, the literature shows that several criteria can be used in strategies that seek to capture trends in the momentum effect.", "Mendonça , Campani & Leal (2017) evaluate the use of the SR and the historical Jensen's alpha as selection criteria for equity investment funds. When evaluating the performance of the portfolios formed based on these criteria, they were able to find persistence of performance in these fu nds when performance is evaluated by Jensen's alpha. Campani and Leal (2016) propose the use of equally weighted portfolios to develop two stock indices that later gave rise to the Valor -Coppead Indices currently available for Brazilian investors . One of them, which seeks the maximum return with the same volatility as the whole Brazilian stock market , is based on the momentum effect: in this case, the Israelsen's (2005) adjusted SR is used as the sto ck selection criterion.", "2.2 Real estate investment trusts", "In this paper , what is denoted as BR -REIT s is what is known in Brazil as ‘Fundos de investimentos imobiliários’ (FIIs). BR -REITs can be considered the corresponding assets on", "the Brazilian stock exchange to the American Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs). Despite some differences in the regulation of American REITs and BR-REITs and some particularities that do not make them exactly the same, BR -REITs are very similar to American REITs . According to B3 (202 1) there is a predominance of individual investors in BR -REITs when compared to institutional investor s. This is indicates that this asset class may be subject to market inefficiencies , given the lower sophistication of this kind of investor, according to the definition presented in Carneiro and Leal (2017) . Furthermore, because it is an incipient market and it is still in a maturation process , it may be exposed to such inefficiencies . This maturation process has been taking place since 2008, when the Brazilian Securities exchange commission (Comissão de Valores Mobiliários - CVM) created Instruction n. 472, bringing greater regulatory organization . Since then, there has been a jump in the total number of investors in this class, which was of approximately 12,000 in December 2009 and in December 2020 had already reached approximately 1,172,000, according to B3 (202 1). The aforemen tioned predominance of individual investors is clear when assessing that they correspond to more than 99% of the total number of investors, based on the same publication. The tax exemption offered by Brazilian legislation for BR-REIT s mostly composed of th is type of investor partly explains their greater participation.", "In contrast to the evidence that the BR -REIT s’ class is subject to market ineffic iencies, which can generate momentum and reversals due to underreaction and overreaction, the finance literature in Brazil has shown greater interest in studying the returns of BR-REITs based on explanatory variables associated with risks , abiding to the efficien t market hypothes is. Oliveira and Milani (2020) perform a risk -return analysis that shows that the IBOVESPA, among the various variables studied, is the one that best explains the return of the BR-REIT s’ market index (IFIX). On the other hand, Dias (2019) finds that the returns of BR -REIT s and those of the market (measured by the IBOVESPA) have a low covariance when evaluated by the beta of the CAPM model.", "In addition, previous art icles ( Calado, Giotto & Securato, 2002 ; Amato et al. 2005 ) studied basic characteristics of BR -REIT s, such as predominant sectors of activity, number of investors, etc. during the initial maturation process of this asset class. More recently Nascimento, Scaramussa, and Bortolon (2020) evaluated returns of BR -REIT s in the peri od from 2010 to 2019 considering the influences of aspects such as management, regulation, and taxation. Detaching from the general tendency of the literature to evaluate risk variables and basic characteristics of BR-REIT s, Guimarães (2013) uses the four -factor model of Carhart (1997) in", "a small sample of real estate funds. In this study, a tendency of performance maintenance is found, observing the persistence of returns (momentum) in BR-REIT s with higher profitability. The international literature, in turn, shows that behavioral factors influence the return of REITs, generating momentum and reversal strategies. Chui, Titman, and Wei (2003b) find momentum in REITs that c annot be explained by risk variables. Thus, they propose a behavioral explanation based on the theory of Daniel, Hirshleifer, and Subrahmanyam (1998) . They state that from 1992 onwards, there is evidence that changes in the management style of REITs a nd corporate structuring made the valuation of this asset class more difficult because they made information less accessible, making investors more suscept ible to acting with overconfidence. In this context, the adoption of the strategy proposed by Jegadeesh and Titman (1993) for a sample of REITs, generated 0.89% of monthly return from 1983 to 1999. This return was higher than t he 0.49% generated by the same strategy applied to stocks, indicating that momentum in REITs had greater magnitude in the period.", "Hung and Glascock (2008) find higher returns obtained with momentum strategies from 1992 onwards. From that year onwards there were also higher rates of DY. From this, they analyze that these higher rates partially explain the returns obtained with those strategies. Furthermore, the authors show that DY are higher (lower) among ranked winners (losers) as a function of past returns. The use of the DY in the study by Hung and Glascock is presented as a risk -based explanation for the existence of momentum, that is, they justify the existence of momentum due to the risk inherent to variations in the DY .", "More r ecently there has been other studies associating momentum returns in REITs. Hao et al. (2016) find empirical evidence that different winner and loser portfolio strategies deliver different momentum returns in the REIT s’ market . They show that a strategy based on George and Hwang (2004) , which consists of using the 52 -week high as selection criterion, delivers more momentum return s than the ones based on past returns . In another empirical paper, Bron, Ghosh and Petrova (2017) studied REIT s in Europe and UK and found evidence of momentum, differentiating between price and earnings momentum. Using a direct measure for continuing overreaction of Byun, Li m, and Yun (2016) , Liu and Lu (2019) find that a continuing overreaction strategy in American REIT s would earn positive and significant returns. In line with the empirical and theoretical evidence of the international literature and aiming to fill a gap in the Brazilian literature, the following section presents the methodology applied to study BR-REITs in the light of momentum strategies. After tha t, in section 4, results are presented , basing the conclusions in section 5 . Section 6 presents the literature references.", "3 METHODOLOGY", "3.1 Data", "The analysis was carried out for the period from January 2012 to December 2020, thus comprising nine complete years. The period of analysis started one year after the release of the first monthly IFIX return data. Based on the asset selection criterion proposed in the present work, monthly values of the DY were extracted from the Economatica platform, consideri ng the dividends paid during the previous 12 months, composing an annualized value for each BR - REIT , in order to avoid seasonality issues in DY payments. The rankings considered BR-REIT s that traded on the B3 stock exchange and paid dividends for at least 24 months, leaving a total of 137 funds over the entire period of analysis. The total number of BR-REIT s analyzed each month varied according to the launch of new funds and the closing of others. In addition, monthly closing qu otations for each BR -REIT were extracted from Economatica, values from which returns were obtained to evaluate the performance of the portfolios prepared. For this purpose, values adjusted by earnings were considered. For a few situations in which a fund has not been traded in a given month due to illiquidity reasons , the market return (IFIX) was adopted to make up for the lack of return information. Finally, the monthly closing prices of the IFIX and CDI were also extracted from Economatica and they se rved as , respectively, the market return and the risk -free interest rate.", "3.2 Portfolio formation", "3.2.1 Selection criterion and formation period", "The methodology followed by th is paper is similar to that of Jegadeesh and Titman ’s (1993), which consists o f the formation of winner s’ and loser s’ portfolios. The criterion used to differentiate between winners and losers was the DY variation . For that, it was necessary to calculate the DY at the end of each month considering the total dividends paid in the last 12 months divided by the closing prices of that month . From th is monthly DY it was possible to calculate monthly DY variation s.", "Considering this, the geometric mean of these monthly DY variations was calculated for a determined period of time. This period is denoted as the formation period (“i\"). The formation period consists of the period determined for evaluating the DY variation and in this paper will adopt the values of 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. Mathematically, t he calculation of this geometric mean can be simplified as the calculati on of the i-th root of the ratio between the DY paid in the analyzed month “m” (𝐷𝑌𝑚) and the DY paid “i” months before ( 𝐷𝑌𝑚−𝑖).", "Equation 1 presents the process of calculating the criterion 𝛥𝐷𝑌 𝑚 for a given month “m ”:", "An example may elucidate: in a generic month of January of year 2, suppose a BR -REIT had paid $10 in total dividends from February of year 1 to January of year 2. Consider that its price in the end of February was $100. This generates a DY of 10% . Suppose now a formation period of three month s (“i\"=3) . Imagine that three months before ( in October of year 1), the same BR - REIT had paid $5 in total dividends from November of year 0 to October of year 1 and its price was the same $100. This generates a DY of 5%.", "In this case, a value of 2 is obtained when calculating the ratio between the DY of January of year 2 and the DY of October of year 1 , i.e., an increase from 5% to 10%. So, taking the 3 -th root of 2, the DY variation considered in January of year 2 is of approximately 26% per month , considering the formation period of 3 months. The rank ings of the subsequent month (February of year 2) can make use of this information.", "It is important to highlight that s ome aspects of BR-REITs such as t he kind of investment a BR - REIT makes (i.e., a BR -REIT can focus on real estate debt , on real estate properties or even on developing new real estate opportunities) and the number of assets in which a BR -REIT invests could also be analyzed in order to control for the risks associated with th ese aspects . Despite that, in this paper , the results represent the general effect of the DY variation in the market, considering all BR -REITs available in the sample , and do not control for these factors .", "3.2.2 Size and weights of the portfolio s", "The second parameter that varied among portfolios was their size , i.e., the number of constituents . The BR -REIT s were organized into quantiles in each month , following the rankings formed. The BR-REIT s present in the 10%, 20% , and 30% quantiles were selected by the winner portfolios , corresponding to those that had the greatest DY variation in the formation period analyzed . The portfolio s of losers, in turn, were composed of BR-REIT s present in the 90%, 80% , and 70% quantiles, corresponding to those that had the smallest variation or the largest drop in the DY in the analyzed formation period. Thus, winn er (loser) portfolios were composed of the winn er (loser) “j” BR-REIT s, being the parameter “j” the variable that will adopt the values of 10% (90%) , 20% (80%) , and 30% (70%) . From this point on, we will only", "refer to the 10%, 20%, and 30% quantiles, being certain that when addressing losers , these quantiles refer to the bottom of the ranks.", "The constituents entered the portfolio in the same proportion in terms of value. According to Benartzi and Thaler (2001) , it constitute s a good alternative to portfolio weighting for unsophisticated investors. Due to its simplicity and to keep the focus on the constituents picking strategy instead of on any other weighing strategy , 1/N portfolios were used.", "3.2.3 Holding period", "Momentum theories indicate that the abnormal returns seized by it come from market inefficiencies. These inefficiencies, in turn, tend to dissipate over time, from the moment they begin to be identified by the market. Therefore, the strategies developed sought to take advantage of short -term anomalies, adopting monthly rebalancing of the portfolios (holding period equals one month).", "3.3 Transaction costs and taxes", "Transaction costs of 0.0050% referring to trading costs and of 0.0250% referring to settlement costs paid to B3 were considered, totaling a percentage of 0.0300% that levied on the total financial value of each purchase or sale. Considering the current Brazilian market scenario, in which there are already several brokerages exempting investors from brokerage fees for investments made in BR-REIT s, we opted not to consider brokerage fees to be coherent to what we currently observe in the market .", "In addition to these costs, income tax on portfolio liquidation was considered . According to the applicable legislation for the individual investor , income taxes must be paid until the last day of the month after the month in which a strategy was liquidated . In this paper income taxes were recorded at the end of each month considering the rate of 20% when the profit generated by a strategy was calculated to be positive. In turn, w hen the strategies delivered negative results, those were accumulated to compensat e future profits. It should be noted that for this asset class there is no income tax exemption depending on the size of each transaction, as there is for stocks (for transactions carried out with stocks up to the monthly limit of R$ 20,000.00 there is an exemption from paying taxes for individual investors ).", "3.4 Strategies and performance evaluation", "What are denote d as portfolios are the 1/N sets of BR -REIT s selected based on the DY variation . Strategies , in turn, denote any set of pre-defined buy and sell transactions that make use of these portfolios . For instance, a possible strategy is a long one that buys a winner portfolio. Usually, momentum strategies involve buying winn er portfolios and possibly selling loser ones. In the results section , the strategies that involve buying (selling) winners (losers) will use the letter “W” (“L”) as a reference. The results shown in the referred section will correspond to what would have been the return obtained with the long, short, long -short , and long-biased strategies if they had been adopted by an investor .", "The long strategies correspond to buying winner portfolios with 100% of the capital. The short strategies correspond to selling an amount of loser portfolios corresponding to 100% of the capital, and , so, obtaining 100% of capital in leverage. To maintain 100% of the capital invested it was decided to buy 100% of CDI and 100% of IFIX. We opted to follow this structure because when performing the tests of excess return against the IFIX (i.e., subtracting the IFIX returns from the analyzed portfolio ), results would correspond to the return provided by short ing the loser portfolio and the return of CDI. So, a s the CDI corresponds the risk -free interest rate, the excess return subject to risks would only be the obtained by shorting the loser portfoli o. The long -short strategies correspond to buying winner portfolios and selling loser ones by the same amount of 100% of the capital, and, so, obtaining 100% of capital in leverage. To maintain 100% of the capital invested , we opted to invest 100% at the riskless rate ( CDI). The long -biased strategies elaborated were 1.1 W – 0.1 L;1.5 W – 0.5 L; and 2.0 W – 1.0 L. These strategies correspond to buying winner portfolios with 100% of the capital and selling the loser ones considering different percentages of the capital (10%, 50%, and 100% respectively), obtaining this correspondent percentage of capital in leverage. In order to maintain 100% of the capital invested, it was defined that t he leveraged capital obtained would be invested in the same winner portfolios.", "To evaluate the subsequent performance of the portfolios formed based on the selection criterion (DY variation in the prior “i\" months ), the SR is used . To evaluate the strategies, two parameters were calculated, namely: excess return to the market portfolio and Jensen's alpha , which represents a risk -adjusted return . We explain better these measures below .", "3.4.1 Sharpe ratio (SR)", "The SR ( Sharpe, 1966 ) was calculated for each portfolio according to equation 2 below . It is obtained by considering , during the period between January 2012 and December 2020, the", "difference between the arithmetic average of the monthly ret urn on the portfolio (Rp) and the arithmetic average of the monthly return corresponding to the return generated by the risk -free rate (Rf), measured by CDI, divided by the standard deviation of the risk premium of the portfolio in relation to the risk -free rate ( σP).", "3.4.2 Excess return", "The excess return generated by each strategy was calculated to the market portfolio return (measured by the IFIX) for the period between January 2012 and December 2020 . For its calculation, paired series were subtracted, and a T -test was applied to the average of the differences to detect statistical significance or not . It was verified the null hypothesis of this mean being equal or below zero, against the alternative hypothesis that it is superior to zero. Rejecting the null hypothesis would indicate superior performance of the strategy to the passive strategy of buying the market index.", "3.4.3 Jensen’s alpha", "The estimates for the alphas (Jensen, 1968 ) were obtained for the period between January 2012 and December 2020 by calculating the intercept of linear regressions performed using the least- squares method. Such regressions were evaluated based on equation 3 below . They use as a dependent variab le the difference in return of the strategies (Rp,t) to the risk -free rate (Rf,t) and as an independent variable the excess of market return (Rm,t) about the same risk-free rate. The beta parameter (βp) of the regression corresponds to the asset risk relatively to the market. The alpha parameter (α p), which is used as the performance measure, corresponds to the excess return generated by the portfolio to the market after considering the ris k taken by the portfolio . The parameter ε p,t corresponds to th e regression error.", "4 RESULTS", "Theoretical evidence indicate that DY variation may be a useful predictor in BR -REITs. First, the hypothesis that there is information on dividend growth that is not immediately and proportionally incorporated into BR -REITs’ prices would conduct to higher DY compared to previous periods due to underreaction. In addition, the hypothesis that there is information indicating worse future performance of a BR -REIT causing excessive drops in prices that are not justified by proportional dividend decreases would also conduct to higher DY compared to previous periods due to overreaction. So, c onsidering that in both cas es prices would tend to adjust to the level justified by fundamentals, it is expected to find results that indicate that greater (smaller) DY variations tend to indicate better (worse) future performance. This is important because with the use of this one variable it is possible to obtain returns from both underreaction and overreaction .", "Based on this, the results are presented in three subsections. The first one shows the descriptive statistics of each portfolio formed by the winner or loser BR -REITs. This information allows , at a first glance, the evaluation of the adequacy of the DY variation of acting as a criterion for selecting portfolios to compose momentum strategies.", "Complementarily, t he second subsection presents the results of momentum strategies that make use of these portfolios. The subsection is divided in two parts . The first one shows the long, short, and long -short strategies. They are presented as a starting point since these strategies are freque ntly presented in the literature as a common technic for the identification of the momentum effect , constituting a basic verification of the adequacy of the DY variation as a predictor in BR -REITs . Additionally , the second part shows the long -biased strategies as alternative s that, with different risks, would generate higher returns.", "Finally, the third subsection shows the impacts of transaction costs and taxes on the performance of all strategies . It follows the same t wo-part division as the second : the first part presents the long, short, and long -short strategies and the second the long -biased strategies.", "4.1 Descriptive statistics of the portfolios", "Table 1 presents the descriptive statistics for the market indices . It also presents the statistics for the fifteen portfolios formed by winn er BR -REIT s. Winner BR-REITs are the ones which had the greatest DY variation in the formation period analyzed . Additionally, it presents descriptive statistics for the fifteen port folios formed by los er BR -REIT s. Loser BR -REITs are the ones which had the lowest DY variation in the formation period analyzed .", "Winner and loser portfolios are obtained with the consideration of five formation periods “i\": 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. As explained before, the formation period is the period in which the selection criterion ( DY variation) is evaluated. For example , for “i\" = 12 the DY variation in a given month is obtained by calculating t he 12 -th root of the ratio between the DY paid in the analyzed month and the DY paid 12 months before , as shown in equation 1. This cannot be confused with the rebalancing frequency, which is always every month. The other variable that has variated among portfolios was the size “j” of the portfolios . As explained, the sizes of the portfolios are percentages (10%, 20% and 30%) of the total number of eligible BR-REITs and can be different in each month depending on this total number . The table is separated into panels A (market indices), B (winner) and C (losers). On panel A, it is presented the value of 0.90% of the average monthly return for the IFIX in the period between January 2012 and December 2020, which can be compared to the average return of the winner and loser portfolios. In addition, it is presented the average return for CDI. The standard deviation for both series is also presented. The SR for IFIX is 0.06. The SR of CDI does not need calculation since CDI corresponds to the risk -free rate itself. Table 1: Descriptive statistic s Panel A: Market indexes Indices Average return Standard deviation SR Min return Max return", "Panel B: Winner portfolios Size “j”, formation per.", "“i\" Average return Standard deviation SR Min return Max return Avg number of BR - REITs Average Δ DY", "Panel C: Loser portfolios Size “j”, formation per.", "“i\" Average return Standard deviation SR Min return Max return Avg number of BR - REITs Average Δ DY Table 1: On panel A, the average return was obtained based on the arithmetic mean of the monthly returns of the indices. The standard deviation was also calculated based on monthly data. The Sharpe ratio (SR) was calculated based on equation 2 for IFIX since the CD I is the risk -free rate itself. The minimum value corresponds to the lowest observed return. The maximum value corresponds to the highest return observed . On panels B and C, the size “j” of the portfolios adopted values of 10%, 20% , and 30%. The formatio n period “i\" adopted values of 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. 108 monthly return data were generated for each portfolio. The average return was obtained based on the arithmetic mean of the monthly returns of each 1/N portfolio formed based on the size and fo rmation period. The standard deviation was also calculated based on monthly data. The Sharpe Ratio (SR) was calculated based on equation 2. The minimum value corresponds to the lowest observed portfolio return. The maximum value corresponds to the highest observed portfolio return. As the total number of BR -REIT s varied throughout the analysis and the definition of size “j” is given as a percentage of this value, the average number of BR-REIT s is presented as the arithmetic mean of the number of BR-REIT s in each portfolio in each month . The DY variation , in turn, is presented as the monthly average of the arithmetic mean of the DY variation of the portfolio. In the period between January 2012 and December 2020, 108 monthly return data were generated for each winner and loser portfolio. Panels B and C present the average returns, the standard deviations, the Sharpe ratio (SR), the extreme values, the average number of BR - REITs each month in the portfolios, and the average of the past DY variation of each p ortfolio. The last indicator corresponds to how much, on average, BR -REIT’s DY variated in the “i\" months before the one in which such portfolio was chosen. First, it is possible to observe that all the portfolios composed of winn er BR-REIT s had average returns greater than that of the IFIX. In turn, all portfolios formed by los er BR-REIT s showed lower average returns than the index. This is evidence that the predictor used is able to identify not only the next winners , but also the next losers, on averag e. The statistical significance of this result and the possibility of creating investment strategies that beat the market are evaluated in the following subsection .", "It was not possible to identify different standard deviations between winners and losers. Although that , the risk-adjusted performance , measured by the SR presented on panel B indicate positive values for all the winner portfolios. In turn, the value of SR for the loser portf olios shows negative values in all but one portfolio on panel C. This is another good evidence that DY variation might be a useful predictor in this market segment .", "The average DY variation shows how much, on average, the DY has variate d in each portfolio . For example, for the winner portfolio with j=30% and i=3, there was a monthly 4.90% dividend growth during the formation period (3 months , in this case ). This totals an average growth of 15.43% in three months for each BR -REIT that constituted t he portfolio . The result of t he average DY variation is always positive in the portfolios formed by winners , indicating, when analyzed together with the SR, that positive DY variations are connected to positive SR. The opposite is also true: this indicator is always negative in the portfolios formed by losers, indicating, when analyzed together with the SR, that negative DY variations are connected to negative SR.", "4.2 Performance of momentum strategies", "4.2.1 Long, short , and long-short strategies", "The previous results lead to th ese analys es. By having identified different performances of portfolios composed by winner and loser BR-REITs , it is relevant to investigate the possibility of developing strategies based on momentum that outperform the market portfolio , but with different risk profiles .", "Long strategies correspond to buying winner portfolios with 100% of the capital , what generates the same returns as on Panel B of table 1. Short strategies correspond to selling an amount of loser portfolios corresponding to 100% of the capital, and, so, obtaining 100% of the capital in leverage. In order to maintain 100% of the capital invested it is necessary to buy 100% of CDI and 100% of I FIX. The long -short strategies correspond to buying winner portfolios and selling loser ones by the same amount of 100% of the capital, and, so, obtaining 100% of the capital in leverage. In order to maintain 100% of the capital invested it is necessary to buy 100% of CDI. Buying the winner portfolios constitutes a conservative strategy that can be adopted by the unsophisticated investor. Short selling the loser portfolio, on the other hand, constitutes a leveraged strategy and it depends on liquidity issues. Long -short constitutes also a leveraged strategy and the bets are doubled, since the investor buys a potential winner portfolio and sells a potential loser portfolio . Notwithstanding, the long-short strategy can be considered a neutral", "strategy, since it does not depend on market positive returns to be profitable : it can return a positive performance both in cases of market decline s or rise s, constituting an interesting alternative that bets on the selection criterion and not on the market itself. Table 2 shows the results obtained with the following strategies: (i) buying the 15 winner portfolios (W), (ii) selling 15 loser portfolios ( -L), and (iii) elaboration of 15 two -way strategies buying the winner portfolios and selling the loser ones (W -L).

The market portfolio was represented by IFIX. All returns are monthly.", "Table 2 shows on panel A that, in the 108 months from January 2012 to December 2020, all strategies generated positive excess return. These values were submitted to the paired T -test to evaluate the null hypothesis that they are equal or below zero against the alternative hypothesis that these values would be greater than zero. Many of the results on panel A showed to be", "statistically significant. These results provide evidence that the DY variation can be used as a predictor to generate positive performances from both the long and short ends. In the same way, panel B shows that all strategies also generated positive alphas. The intercepts of the linear regression obtained from equation 3 were submitted t o the T -test to evaluate the null hypothesis that they are equal or below zero against the alternative hypothesis that these values would be greater than zero. Again, most of the results on panel B showed to be statistically significant. These results reinforce our findings in favor of the predictor , even when using a measure adjusted to risk.", "By analyzing panels A and B, it can be observed that the magnitude of both the excess returns and alpha tend to decrease as the formation period in months (parameter “i”) increases . This means that strategies that make use of portfolios in which the past DY variation is calculated considering larger interval s of months generate lower returns. So, the highest returns were obtained with portfolios in which the DY variation is calculated in relation to the prior month (“i\" = 1 month), indicating that in the short -term effects are better observed . On the other hand, with larger formation periods, portfolios end up obtaining lower excess return s and alpha s relatively to the main market index (IFIX) . This corroborates the idea that the effects that lead to superior performances tend to dissipate over longer periods.", "The analysis of the portfolio size (parameter “j” ), in turn, shows that, as it increase s, considering percentage s of the total number of eligible BR -REITs, the excess return s and alpha s tend to decrease. This is expected, after all, with greater diversification, there may be lower returns, but which, when adjusted for risk, still offer competitive performances .", "Furthermore, buying the portfolio s composed of winner BR -REIT s outperformed th e selling of the portfolios constituted of losers 12 of 15 times , when performance is measured by excess return. When performance is measured by alpha the situation is inverted: buying winners outperformed selling losers 4 of 15 times. This inversion is an interesting result because when evaluated under a variable that adjusts the return to risk s, shorting the loser portfolios proved to gain competitiveness.", "4.2.2 Long -biased strategies", "Long -biased strategies mean that the final exposure to the market is positive . Since former results showed that it is possible to develop strategies based on winner and loser portfolios, the present analysis, therefore, lends itself to providing additional information on what would have been the above -market return obtained with th e adoption of slightly riskier strategies.", "Table 3 shows three different long-biased strategies . The first is the 1.1W – 0.1L strategy , which means buying the winner portfolio with 100% of the capital plus an extra 10% of leverage . The leveraged strategy makes use of the 10% of capital obtained with the short -selling of the loser portfolio. The strategies: 1.5 W – 0.5 L and 2 .0 W – 1.0 L were also analyzed. Table 3 shows on panel A that, in the 108 months from January 2012 to December 2020, all strategies generated positive excess return. These values were submitted to the paired T -test, from which 37 showed to be statistically significant. Analogously, panel B shows that all strategies also generated positive alphas.

Panel B, on the other hand, shows that alphas are positive with statistical significance in 28 strategies , including all of them with rebalancing every month .", "In addition, as the portfolios have a constant holding period of one month , the payment of taxes on profits calculated on the settlement of operations could have potentially decreased returns. However, this was not the case on table 4, evidencing that the returns obtained by the portfolios were not exclusively due to price retur ns.", "The fact that returns can also be attributed to dividends is what made it possible not to burden the strategies excessively since this part of the return is exempted from paying taxes . The importance of dividends on the returns of BR -REIT s is evidence of the adequacy of the DY variation as an important measure of past performance to be considered in momentum strategies.", "Table 4: Impacts of transaction costs on long, short, and long -short strategies Panel A: Excess return s relatively to IFIX j Strategy i= 1 3 6 9 12", "Panel B: Alpha s relatively to IFIX (single -factor model) j Strategy i= 1 3 6 9 12", "Table 4: on both panels A and B, the symbols *, **, and *** denote, respectively, significance at the levels of 10%, 5%, and 1%.

Results show that winner ( and loser) portfolios , composed by the BR -REIT s that presented large r (respectively, smalle r) DY variations performed better (respectively, worse) than the market portfolio measured by the IFIX. Several s trategies that buy winners and/or sell losers were evaluated in comparison to the market portfolio . We showed that these strategies were able to benefit from both ends of the DY variation ranking . Most of these results were shown to be statistically significant.", "We tested strategies based on different formation periods , what has led to the conclusion that strategies that adopt longer formation periods present lower returns. This indicates that the superior performance tends to be better observed in the short term and, so, corroborates the hypothesis that the se effects may possibly be explained by behavioral factors, which also tend to not last long.", "It is not possible to test a causal relationship between DY variation and future returns , even though we can conjecture . Theoretical evidence shows that the observation of irregularities on dividend payments and prices that generate variations in the DY can be a guide to anticipate possible inefficiencies or departure from fundamentals . This m ight explain the results found by this paper in the Brazilian REIT s’ market .", "These findings are important because the Brazilian finance literature has focused, mainly, on the study of BR -REIT s from a risk -return perspective , based on the efficient -marke t hypothes is. The observation of market inefficiencies giving rise to a predictor in this market is relevant and innovative , which means that this study may pave a fruitful line of further research and practical applications .", "It is important to state that the results are restrict to the sample analyzed, which did not control for the kind of investment a BR -REIT makes (i.e., a BR -REIT can focus on real estate debt , on real estate properties or even on developing new real estate opportunities) and the number of assets in which a BR -REIT invests . Furthermore, t wo limitations of this work are worth mentioning . First, in the analyzed period , short -selling BR-REIT s was not possible . So, the analysis performed with short strategies is only illustrative of what returns would these strateg ies have generated for the investors (short -selling BR -REITs became possible only in 2020) . In addition, BR -REIT s compose an asset class in which liquidity is a concern , what brings some limitations in case a large investor wants to implement any strategy analyze d here.", "As a proposal for future research, we cite the study of which behavioral biases and heuristics may cause the inefficiencies that generate the results presented. Besides this , an interesting line of research is assessing w hether control of variables such as liquidity, size, number of invested assets , and the kind of investment a BR -REIT makes ( ‘paper ’ or ‘brick ’ investor) influence the results presented in this paper.", "The substantial excess return s and alphas obtained from the analyzed strategies, specificall y the long-short and long -biased ones, are evidence that the DY variation is useful as a predictor to outperform the market to a great degree . Over and above that, the strategies analyzed are of simple elaboration and made use of variables available to any investor, so that the results of this paper shall interes t investors in general and, more specifically, institutional investors and portfolio managers who operate funds of funds of BR -REITs.

The first hypothesis (H1) we tested is wheth er dividend payouts affect positively the price of a stock, ceteris paribus .

The implicit assumption is that, since investors suffer from bounded rationality, according to behavioral finance, they alternatively must rely on imperfect heuristics in their decision making. The goal, therefore, is to test whether the composition of the index is used as such, presumably, by investors who are seeking relatively high dividend paying stocks. We find that higher positives changes in composition of IDIV, from the 3rd quarter of 2021 to the 1st quarter of 2022, were correlated to higher stock prices, which were not driven by changes in the IBOV index composition, neither from the January (month fixed -) effect. Additionally, we replicate the results using a difference -in-differences approach.", "Keywords: dividends, differences -in-differences, IDIV, stock price, asset pricing, Brazilian stock market.", "CONTENTS", "1 INTRODUCTION", "The issue of why companies pay dividends, and, perhaps more importantly, whether they should, has been the subject of endless controversy in the finance literature, despite the many theoretical, as well as empirical, advancements made. The first question can be traced back to the very history of the modern corporation. This form of legal entity and ownership sprung from 17th century commercial voyages: highly risky, but also profitable. Investors would pool resources on behalf of a ship’s captain, who, upon returning, ideally would pay back investors their invested capital alongside the proceeds from the expedition. As these trades became more frequent, investors would only receive the proceeds of the expedit ions (a.k.a., dividends). Moreover, investors had a preference for stocks that behaved like government bonds, i.e., paying stable dividends. The second question, of normative nature, has been extensively studied, and has yielded three major stances: divide nd payouts either create value, they destroy value, or they are irrelevant. According to the bird -in-hand hypothesis, due to uncertainty about the future, dividends now are preferable to capital gains later. On the other hand, the tax -effect hypothesis, cl aims that, since dividends are more heavily taxed than capital gains (which is not always the case, including in Brazil), dividends reduce after -tax, i.e., net, returns. Extending the tax argument, the clientele hypothesis claims different investors prefer different dividend policies. Generally speaking, older, low -income individuals favor them, whereas younger, high -income investors have a preference for capital gains. Still, the signaling hypothesis suggests dividends commitments are a credible signal fro m managers about the company’s future prospects. Lastly, the dividend irrelevance hypothesis, by Miller & Modigliani (1961) , despite being of seminal theoretical importance, as it claimed a company’s value depends only on its discounted projected future ca sh flows, and not on how its profits are distributed, was based on very restrictive conditions, such as perfect capital markets, no transaction costs, perfect information, and isonomic treatment across market participants. While not accurately describing w hy companies pay dividends, their model is still the reference point for most discussions. Empirically, however, there has been ample evidence investors react positively to dividend announcements, though no consensus has emerged on why that is. After checking the data on the Brazilian stock market for confirmation on the past empirical evidence, whether dividend payouts affect positively the price of a stock, ceteris paribus , (H1), the relevant contribution this paper seeks to provide is to test (H2): whether investors use the composition of the dividend index (IDIV) as a heuristic for a company’ s dividend payout policy. IDIV is the Brazilian stock market index representing the weighted -average total returns of the top -dividend -paying publicly -traded companies. The implicit assumption is that, since investors suffer from bounded rationality, accor ding to behavioral finance, they alternatively must rely on imperfect heuristics in their decision making.", "2 LITERATURE REVIEW", "2.1 The Brazilian Stock Market", "The Brazilian Stock Exchange is based in São Paulo and, since 2017, answers by the company name of B3, used henceforward as shorthand for the Brazilian stock exchange (B3, 2021). B3 is an electronic exchange, such as NASDAQ, and for the purposes of this paper there are no relevant idiosyncrasies pertaining to its functioning. Two institutional aspec ts, however, require some clarification: legal minimum dividend payout, and interest on equity.", "The legislation which regulates dividend payments (6.404/1976) establishes that shareholders are entitled to receive as mandatory dividend, in each fiscal year , a certain portion of the company's profits. In its article 202, it states that shareholders are entitled to receive as mandatory dividend, in each year, the portion of profits defined in the company’s statute. In the second item of the same article, it i s established that, in case the statute explicitly defines a dividend payout policy, the minimum mandatory dividend cannot be less than 25% of the adjusted net income. This legal provision should not be confused with the American concept of minimum dividen d, which is the fixed amount - in cash or percentage relative to the par value of the share - that is owed to the shareholders of the companies. (Procianoy, 2016). A presumed objective in establishing a minimum mandatory dividend was to protect the minorit y shareholder, by preventing the controller from retaining all the profits (La Porta et al. 2000). While management could, in theory, always devise expenses to prevent a net profit and, hence, dividend payments, that is not observed in practice. (For an ex tensive discussion of the topic see Procianoy, 2016). In the aftermath of the rollout of a new currency – Real – as part of a successful strategy to halt an ongoing hyperinflation process, a long period of monetary correction in companies' financial state ments ended (alongside hyperinflation). To offset the financial loss companies were experiencing, the provision for interest on equity (Juros sobre Capital Próprio – JCP) was created, which meant the calculation of interest on shareholders' equity and its appropriation as an expense for purposes of calculating corporate taxation. Until 1995, the net equity values were subject to monetary correction. The monetary correction system was revoked, in the following year, by article 4 of Law (9.249/95), in line with the objectives of de -indexing the economy, established with the Real Plan. In order to mitigate the effects on companies' equity, resulting from the extinction of monetary correction, article 10 established that, for the purpose of calculating the net profit, interest paid or credited individually to partners or shareholders may be deducted as proceeds, from equity. The effective payment or credit of interest is subject to the existence of profits computed before the deduction of interest or accumulate d profits, or profit reserve, in an amount equal to or greater than twice the interest to be paid or credited. Furthermore, Article 9 allows for interest on equity payments to be deducted of the legal minimum dividend payout Thus, interest on equity, when transformed into a dividend, can benefit companies with a deductible dividend for purposes of calculating corporate income tax. The only caveat is, while dividends have been tax -exempt since 1996, interests on equity are taxed 15% upfront, that is, shareho lders only receive 85% of what companies choose to distribute (Zani, 2000). The need to clarify those two concepts stems from the fact that the dividend index (IDIV) includes both dividends and interests on equity to calculate each stock’s dividend yield. More formally, IDIV is calculated by B3, much like the Bovespa Index (IBOV) – the benchmark for market returns – IDIV aims to be the indicator of the average performance of shares issued by publicly -traded companies that have stood out in terms of investor payout, in the form of distribution of dividends and interest on equity. The main rules are as follows (B3, 2018) .", "They must:", " Be among the eligible securities that collectively represent ninety -nine percent (99%) of the sum total of this indicator measure d in descending order by Tradability Ratio (TR) for the previous three portfolio cycles ;  Be present in 95% (ninety -five percent) of the trading sessions during the period of validity of the 3 (three) previous portfolios ;  Not be classified as Penny Stock ;  Be within 33% (thirty -three percent) of the total securities with the highest dividend yields (see Appendix – Dividend Yield Calculation) distributed among securities in the last 36 (thirty -six) months ;  Have the sum of the dividend yields for each 12 (twe lve) consecutive months observed in the period of 36 (thirty -six) months greater than 0 (zero) .  The representativeness of an asset in the index, during periodic revaluations, cannot exceed 3 (three) times the share that the asset would have if the portfoli o were weighted by the representativeness of the asset's free float market value. It should be noted that the participation of a company's assets in the index (considering all types and classes of shares or units backed by such company shares, as the case may be) may not exceed 10% (ten percent) at the time of inclusions or periodic reassessments.", "To calculate the dividend yield that will be used in the selection and weighting of assets, the period of 36 (thirty -six) months prior to the valuation date of th e index portfolio must be observed. Subsequently, one should proceed according to the steps below. 1. The period observed is divided into 3 (three) periods (t = 1, 2, 3) equal to 12 (twelve) months.", "2.

At the end of each four -month period, the portfolio is rebalanced, using the procedures and criteria that are part of this methodology. Obviously, the index is not overly susceptible to short term market fluctuati ons. Considering dividends as more stable than stock prices, it is possible that part of its rebalancing reflects stock prices effects, rather than a substantial change in dividend policy. Even so, the index stills signals, arguably, relevant information, in particular, high dividend paying companies as well as the median dividend yield for that subset.", "2.2 The Role of Dividends", "As Frankfurter and Wood (1997) have noted, dividend payouts are historically indissociable from the development of the corporate fo rm itself. Corporate dividends date as far back as the early 16th century, when ship captains started selling financial claims to investors, which entitled them to share in the proceeds of the voyages. By the end of the century, these financial claims began to be publicly traded in Amsterdam and were gradually replaced by shares of ownership. At the end of each voyage, enterprise liquidation ensured a distribution of the profits and helped to reduce the chances of fraud (Baskin, 1988). As these ventures bec ame more profitable and regular, the process of liquidation at th e end of each voyage became increasingly inconvenient and costly. The ventures’ success increased their credibility and shareholders became more confident in their management (captains), accomplished by, among other things, the payment of “generous dividen ds” (Baskin, 1988). As a result, these companies began trading as “going concern” entities, and distributing only the profits rather than the entire invested capital. This new form of organization gave rise to the issue of deciding what proportion of the f irms’ income (rather than assets) to return to investors and produced the first dividend payment regulations (Frankfurter and Wood, 1997).", "Companies modelled themselves after bonds, which made regular and stable interest payments, and corporate managers fo und that investors preferred shares that performed like bonds. The Bank of North America in 1781 paid dividends after only six months of operation, “Paying consistent dividends remained of paramount importance to managers during the first half of the 19th century” (Frankfurter and Wood, 1997, p.24) In the absence of regular and accurate corporate reporting, dividends were often preferred to reinvested earnings, and often even regarded as a better indication of corporate performance than published earnings a ccounts. Consequently, an increase in divided payments tended to be reflected in rising stock prices. As corporations became aware of this phenomenon, it raised the possibility that managers of companies could use dividends to signal strong earnings prospe cts. Corporate managers soon realized the importance of dividend payments in satisfying shareholders expectations. They often smoothed dividends over time believing that dividend reductions might have unfavorable effects on share price and therefore, used dividends as a device to signal information to the market. Since the 1950’s, the effect of dividend policy on firm value and other issues of corporate dividend policy have been subjected to a great debate among finance scholars (Al - Malkawi, 2010).", "Three m ain contradictory theories of dividends can be identified. High dividends increase share value theory (or the so -called “bird -in-the- hand” argument), low dividends increase share value theory (the tax -preference argument), and the dividend irrelevance hypothesis. More recently, other explanations have been put forward to try to solve what Black (1976) famously dubbed a puzzle. These arguments include the information content of dividends (signaling), the clientele effects, and the agency cost hypotheses. Modigliani & Miller (1961) (M&M) argued that regardless of how the firm distributes its income, its value is determined by its earning capacity and its investment decisions. In other words, investors calculate the value of companies based on the discounted (compounded) value of their future earnings, and this is not affected by whether firms pay dividends or not and how dividend policies are set. The conclusion that in perfect capital markets dividend policy should be irrelevant is a logical extension of the neoclassical assumption of perfect competition into financial economics.", "Black and Scholes (1974), to test the tax -effect hypothesis, examined the relationship between dividend yield and stock returns. Their results showed that the dividend yield coeffic ient is not significantly different from zero either for the entire period (1936 -1966) or for any of shorter subperiods. That is, the expected return either on high or low yield stocks is the same. Black and Scholes, therefore, concluded that, “we are unab le to show that differences in yield lead to differences in stock prices” (p.18).", "Other studies by leading financial economic researchers such as Miller and Scholes (1978,1982), Hess (1981) Miller (1986), and more recently, Bernstein (1996) provided eviden ce in support of the dividend irrelevance hypothesis. Ball et al. (1979) examined the effect of dividends on firm value using Australian data over the period from 1960 to 1969. However, they failed to find conclusive evidence to support M&M’s irrelevance proposition. Baker, Farrelly and Edelman (1985) surveyed the chief financial officers (CFOs) of 562 firms listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) from three industry groups (150 utilities, 309 manufacturing, and 103 wholesale/retail). Based on 318 responses, they found that respondents strongly agreed that dividend policy affects common stock prices. Baker and Powell (1999) surveyed 603 CFOs of US firms listed on the NYSE, and observed that 90% believed that dividend policy affects a firm’s value as well as its cost of capital. Other studies including Siddiqi (1995) and Casey and Dickens (2000) have provided evidence inconsistent with DIH.", "Relaxing the perfect information hypothesis, it can be argued that, giving the ensuing uncertainty, dividends are va lued differently to retained earnings (or capital gains). Investors prefer the “bird in the hand” of cash dividends rather than the “two in the bush” of future capital gains. As a higher current dividend reduces uncertainty about future cash flows, a high payout ratio will reduce the cost of capital, and hence increase share value The tax -effect hypothesis states that low dividend payout ratios lower the cost of capital and increase the stock price. That is, low dividend payout ratios contribute to maximizing the firm’s value. This argument is based on the assumption that dividends are taxed at higher rates than capital gains. In addition, dividends are taxed immediately, while taxes on capital gains are deferred until the stock is actually sold. The se tax advantages of capital gains over dividends tend to predispose investors, who have favorable tax treatment on capital gains, to prefer companies that retain most of their earnings rather than pay ing them out as dividends, and are willing to pay a pre mium for low -payout companies. Therefore, a low dividend payout ratio lower s the cost of equity and increases the stock price. Brennan (1970) developed an after -tax version of the capital asset pricing model (CAPM) to test the relationship between tax risk -adjusted returns and dividend yield. Higher pre -tax risk adjusted returns are associated with higher dividend yield stocks to compensate investors for the tax disadvantages of these returns. This suggests that, ceteris paribus , a stock with higher dividen d yield will sell at lower prices because of the disadvantage of higher taxes associated with dividend income. Higher pre -tax risk - adjusted returns are necessary to compensate investors for holding high -dividend -paying stocks because of the disadvantage as sociated with dividend income. However, in Brazil dividends are tax exempt for the investor, and hence we expect this theory not to be replicated in Brazil.", "The Dividend Clientele Effect Hypothesis (DCH) , posits that the two sets of factors are likely to c ancel each other out after all: investors in high tax brackets likely prefer either no or low dividends. Low tax bracket investors generally fall into three categories: low - income individuals, pension funds, which pay no taxes on either dividends or capita l gains, and corporations, which can exclude at least 70% of their dividend income but cannot exclude any of their capital gains. Thus, corporations are likely to prefer high - dividend stocks, even without a preference for current income. (Graham & Kumar, 2 006). It is worth mentioning, nonetheless, that the tax treatment above described is US -specific, though the intuition can be easily extrapolated to other institutional settings.", "Allen, Bernardo and Welch (2000) suggest that clienteles such as institutional investors tend to be attracted to invest in dividend -paying stocks because they have relative tax advantages over individual investors. These institutions are also often subject to restrictions in institutional charters (such as the “prudent man rule”), which, to some extent, prevent them from investing in non -paying or low -dividend stocks. Analogously, good quality firms prefer to attract institutional clienteles (by paying dividends) because institutions are better informed than retail inves tors and have more ability to assess the company’s fundamentals, in other words, avoiding price volatility. It is worth noting that institutional investors face liquidity constraints to sell off their holdings . As such, these decisions are taken, at least, in a medium -term perspective. This prediction is consistent with the signaling hypothesis. Allen et al. link signaling and agency arguments with the clientele effects of dividend hypothesis. They conclude positing that, “…these clientele effects are the v ery reason for the presence of dividends…” (2000, p. 2531).", "The previous arguments pointed out that the corporate leverage decision involves a trade - off. The firm’s capital structure is optimized where the marginal subsidy to debt equals the marginal cost . while all firms will increase debt levels somewhat to fool investors, the costs of extra debt prevent the less valuable firms from issuing more debt than the more valuable firms issue. Thus, investors can still treat debt level as a signal of firm value. In other words, investors can still view an announcement of debt as a positive sign for the firm.", "Drawing from M&M’s assumptions, signaling theory follows from relaxing the perfect information premise. And, consequently, moving to a more realistic model, namely, one accounting for the existence of asymmetric information between insiders (managers) and outsiders (shareholders). The former, who look after the firm, usually possess information about its current and future prospects that is not available to t he latter. This informational gap between insiders and outsiders may cause the true intrinsic value of the firm to be unavailable to the market. If so, share price may not reflect the best estimate of the firm’s value (Al -Malkawi, 2010). Historically, due to a lack of complete and reliable information to shareholders, the cash flow provided by a security to an investor often formed the basis for its market valuation (Baskin and Miranti, 1997). Hence dividends came to provide a useful tool for managers with which to convey their private information to the market because investors used visible (or actual) cash flows to equity as a way of valuing a firm. Even M&M (1961) suggest that , when markets are imperfect , share prices may respond to changes in dividends. In other words, dividend announcements may be seen to convey implicit information about the firm’s future earnings potential. This proposition has since become known as the “information content of dividends” or signaling hypothesis. For it to hold, (1) man agers should have private information about a firm’s prospects and incentives to convey that information to the market. And (2) a signal should be true; i.e., a firm with poor future prospects should not be able to mimic it and send false signals to the ma rket by increasing dividend payments.", "Empirical work on dividend signaling has examined two main issues: (1) whether share prices move in the same direction with dividend change announcements, and (2) whether dividend changes enable the market to predict future earnings. Unsurprisingly, results have been mixed. Pettit (1972) observed that dividend announcements do communicate valuable information, and showed that the market reacts positively to the announcement of dividend increases, and vice -versa: “…div idend announcement, when forthcoming, may convey significantly more information than the information implicit in an earnings announcement” (p.1002). Aharony and Swary (1980) argued that dividend and earning announcements are not perfect substitutes and a p roper test for the signaling hypothesis needs to that take into account. Still, they found support for the results obtained by Pettit even after controlling for contemporaneous earnings announcements. Woolridge (1983) also found a significant increase (dec rease) in common stock returns following the unexpected dividend increase (decrease) announcements. Asquith and Mullins (1983), in an often -cited paper, examined the market’s reaction to dividend announcements for a sample of 168 firms that initiated divid ends either for the first time in their corporate history or resumed paying dividends after at least a ten -year hiatus. They tested the average daily excess stock returns ten days before and ten days after the announcement of dividend initiation. For the t wo-day announcement period their result shows that there is an excess return of about +3.7 percent. Michaely, Thaler and Womack (1995) have gone further by examining the impact of initiations and omissions of dividends on share prices. They observed 561 di vidend initiation events and 887 dividend omission events over the period of 1964 to 1988. During the three days surrounding announcements, the average excess return was about –7.0% for omissions and +3.4 % for dividend initiations. More recently, Bali (20 03) presented evidence consistent with the preceding results. He reported an average 1.17% abnormal return for dividend increases and -5.87% for decreases. He also tested the long run drifts of stock prices in reaction to dividend policy changes and reinfo rced Michaely et al.’s (1995) findings. The signaling power of dividends, however, may not be the same in markets other than the US. In a comparison study of dividend policies between Japanese and US firms, Dewenter and Warther (1998) revealed that the inf luence of dividends as a signaling mechanism in Japan is significantly lower when compared to the US. Japanese firms are subject to less information asymmetry especially among keiretsu (industrial groups) member firms. These differences in findings are att ributable to the differences in corporate governance structures between Japan and the US, and moreover to the nature of corporate ownership in Japan. Conroy, Eades and Harris (2000) provide evidence consistent with Dewenter and Warther’s (1998) study for J apanese firms.", "One of the assumptions of M&M’s perfect capital market is that there are no conflicts of interests between managers and shareholders. In practice, however, this assumption is obviously questionable, i.e., managers are imperfect agents of s hareholders (principals). This gives rise to agency costs: generally defined as the costs from the conflicts of interest among stockholders, bondholders, and managers (Ross, 2015). In 1976, Jansen & Meckling addressed the potential conflict between shareho lders and bondholders. Shareholders are considered as the agents of bondholders’ funds: excess dividend payments to shareholders may be taken as shareholders expropriating wealth from bondholders . Shareholders have limited liability and they can access the company’s cash flow before bondholders; consequently, bondholders prefer to put constraints on dividend payments to secure their claims. Conversely, for the same reasons, shareholders prefer to have large dividend payments (Ang, 1987). In 1984, Easterbroo k argued that dividends could be used to reduce the free cash flow in the hands of managers. In addition, he hypothesized that dividend payments would oblige managers to approach the capital market to raise funds. In this case investment professionals such as bankers and financial analysts will also be able to monitor managers’ behavior. Therefore, shareholders are able to monitor managers at lower cost. This suggests that dividend payments increase management scrutiny by outsiders and reduce the chances fo r managers to act in their own self -interest .", "Rozeff (1982), for instance, was one of the first to formally model agency costs using a large sample of US firms. The key idea of Rozeff’s (1982) model is that the optimal dividend payout is at the level where the sum of transaction costs and agency costs are minimized, therefore it was called “cost minimization model”. Rozeff’s model implied that there should be a negative relationship between the percentage of stock held by insiders (insider ownership) and th e payout ratio, and a positive relationship between the number of shareholders (dispersion of ownership) and the dividend payout ratio. He suggested that the benefits of dividends in reducing agency costs are smaller for companies with lower dispersion of ownership and/or higher insider ownership. He found the agency costs variables significant and consistent with their hypothesized relations. Alli et al. (1993) found the ownership dispersion factor insignificant in relation to dividend decision, inconsiste nt with Rozeff (1982). However, the insider ownership variable was found to be significant and negatively related to dividend payouts. Jensen, Solberg and Zorn (1992) applied three -stage least squares to examine the determinants of cross -sectional differen ces in insider ownership, debt, and dividend policy. They used a sample of 565 firms for the year 1982 and 632 firms for the year 1987. The insider ownership variable was found statistically significant with a negative sign, implying that there is a negati ve relationship between insider holdings and dividend payments, which is consistent with Rozeff (1982) and therefore with the agency costs hypothesis. More recently, Holder, Langrehr and Hexter (1998), from a sample of 477 US firms over the period from 1980 to 1990, reported that insider ownership and dividend payouts are significantly and negatively related and that the number of shareholders positively influences payouts. They also found support for Jensen’s free cash flow hypothesis. Other studies, such as Denis et al. (1994) and Yoon & Starks (1995), however, provide support to the cash flow signaling hypothesis rather than free cash flow hypothesis as an explanation for the stock price reactions to dividend change announcements (Al - Malkawi, 2010).", "2.3 Empirical evidence for dividend payouts in Brazil", "Novis Neto and Saito (2003) reported the impact reflected in the share price after the disclosure of dividends - the study was composed of a total of 163 announcements of dividend payments (events), carri ed out between 1998 and 2000 and included, in its sample, the most traded shares on the São Paulo Stock Exchange (BM&FBovespa – [B]3) in that period. Another study was carried out by Freire et al. (2005) and investigated the relationship between dividend y ield and abnormal profit, concluding that this relationship does not exist for the period analyzed, comprised between the years 1996 and 2001. Procianoy and Verdi (2009) analyzed the clientele effect and the market signaling hypothesis in research carried out between 1996 and 2000 in the Brazilian stock market. They used event studies as one of the methodologies, and reported that there was a positive abnormal return equal to 1.5% on the first ex -dividend day, with a statistical significance level of 1%.", "Martins and Fama (2012) highlighted that dividend policy is one of the most controversial issues in the field of corporate finance. According to Kothari and Warner (2005), event studies examine the behavior of company stock prices around corporate events. K ramer (2001), however, states that the statistical inference method of event studies based on Bootstrap performs better than traditional methods. The Bootstrap method was initially presented by Efron (1979) as a robust process to estimate the distribution of independent and identically distributed data. This procedure, according to Kramer (2001), performs better than traditional methods. Bootstrap also concentrates simulation methods to evaluate the sampling properties of statistical estimates.", "Silva et al.

They found evidence of the usefulness of the proposed additional dividend (DAP) as a mechanism for transmitting opportunities and for future growth of company values.", "Antonio et.al (2018), used event studies based on Bootstrap, to test how corporate events affect stock returns. The minimum period of analysis was ten years, from January 2006 to December 2015 and the results indicated that the distribution of dividends and interest on capital positively influenced the market, as the average abnormal return on the shares was 0.70 % on the day of the event .", "2.4 Heuristics for investments", "Standard finance theories have been developed on the assumption that investors are rational, have complete information, participate in frictionless markets and always make rational decisions. (Shah, 2017). Notable examples include: the Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH; Fama, 1970) and the Modern Portfolio T heory (Markowitz, 1952), which hold that individual investors are rational as well as risk averse and prefer a low risk to a high risk at a given level of return. While these theories have yielded relevant results, it has been long established they do not truly represent how individuals make decisions, nor can they explain “inefficient” market outcomes. Behavioral finance provides a satisfactory demonstration and understanding of why individual investors trade, how they choose their portfolios and how they perform (Shah, 2017). The “father” of bounded rationality, Simon (1989), asked this very question: “How do human beings reason when the conditions for rationality postulated by the model of neoclassical economics are not met?” (p. 377) As Simon (1979, p. 500) stressed in his Nobel Memorial Lecture, the classical model of rationality requires knowledge of all the relevant a lternatives, their consequences and probabilities, and a predictable world without surprises. These conditions, however, are rarely met for the problems that individuals and organizations face.", "Investors often simplify their decision -making processes by u sing behavioral heuristics that might cause systematic errors in judgment and lead to satisfactory investment choices, but not maximize utility (Kahneman and Tversky, 1979). As Kahneman (2003) explained in his Nobel Memorial Lecture: “Our research attempte d to obtain a map of bounded rationality, by exploring the systematic biases that separate the beliefs that people have and the choices they make from the optimal beliefs and choices assumed in rational -agent models” (p. 1449).", "Gigerenzer (2011), who has p ut forward a somewhat different research program than Kahneman and Tversky (K&T), arguably the most influential authors on the subject, defines heuristics as efficient cognitive processes, conscious or unconscious, that ignore part of the information. Beca use using heuristics saves effort, the classical view – he argues – has been that heuristics are more error -prone than “rational” decisions. For many decisions, however, the assumptions of rational models are not met, and it is an empirical rather than an a priori issue how well cognitive heuristics function in an uncertain world. Both Kahneman and Gigerenzer agree on the centrality of heuristics in decision making. However, for Kahneman heuristics often appear as a fall back when the standard von - Neumann –Morgenstern axioms of rational decision -making do not describe investors' choices. In contrast, for Gigerenzer heuristics are simply a more effective way of evaluating choices in the rich and changing decision making environment investors must face (Forbes, 2015).", "Gigerenzer and Brighton (2009) point to ambiguities in application of perhaps the most famous heuristic of all, the representativeness heuristic. This heuristic is sometimes stated to imply that we construct a distribution of expected outcomes acco rding to our distribution of impressions. So, for example, the representative heuristic has been used to explain: the “hot hand” effect that sometimes a person is “on a roll” and scores from every free-kick, or plants home every shot at basket, forming a s treak of good luck and; simultaneously, the “gambler's fallacy” or the spoof “law of small numbers”, this is the belief that small samples must approximate the population they are drawn from and hence, after a poor run “my luck must change”.", "Nevertheless, in Thinking Fast and Slow (2011), Kahneman defines a heuristic as “a very simple procedure that helps find adequate, though often imperfect, answers to difficult questions” (p. 98), by reducing the complexity of measuring probabilities and forecasting values to simpler judgments. Heuristics allow human beings to speed up decision -making, compared to rationally processing the available information.", "Naturally, heuristics also influence financial markets’ behavior (Debondt and Thaler, 1985). Representative, av ailability, overconfidence and anchoring and adjustment are heuristic biases which are used by investors to reduce the risk of loss in uncertain situations. When individual investors use heuristics, they reduce the mental effort in the decision -making proc ess, but that leads to errors in judgment and, as a result, investors make incorrect investment decisions, which could lead to the market becoming inefficient Representativeness: (i) the level to which an event’s characteristics are similar t o its parent population, also (ii) contemplates prominent features of the procedure by which it is yielded (Kahneman, 2011). There are two types of representativeness bias: base -rate neglect and sample -size neglect. Base -rate neglect means not adequately i ncorporating the base likelihood of the stereotype occurring. Sample -size neglect occurs when decision makers try to generalize on the basis of too few examples or incorrectly take small samples as representative of populations (Pompain, 2006). According t o Kahneman and Tversky (1974), individuals use the representativeness heuristic because they do not fully understand the basic concept of forecasts, the preponderance of an event within its population of events or characteristics. Another reason is insensi tivity to the sample size because it is incorrectly believed that small samples of events, people, etc. are representative of the entire populations from which the sample is drawn. People tend to overestimate the likelihood that the characteristics of a sm all sample of a population adequately represent those of the entire population. “We also tend to use the representativeness heuristic when we are very aware of anecdotal evidence based on a very small sample of the population” (Kahneman and Tversky, 1974). The consequences of the representativeness heuristic are that decision makers adopt forecasts on the basis of a small sample and update beliefs using simple classifications rather than complex data.", "Availability is a cognitive heuristic bias, also known a s mental shortcut, that occurs when people rely too much on easily available information in their decisions or predictions. Tversky and Kahneman (1973) suggest that individuals determine the chances of an event by using the availability heuristic, the ease with which relevant data come to mind. They explain that depending on the availability heuristic leads individuals to “systematic biases” and, due to these biases, they overestimate the probability of it repeating. Anchoring and adjustment is a cognitive heuristic bias related to humans’ excessive reliance on the first piece of information provided (the “anchor”) when making decisions. Kahneman and Tversky (1974) argue that different starting points yield different estimates, which are biased towards the initial value. So, the anchoring and adjustment bias can be explained by the tendency of individual investors to “anchor” their ideas or thoughts to a logically irrelevant reference point when making a decision (Pompain,", "3 HYPOTHESIS DEVELOPMENT", "In the Literature Review we discussed several different theories formulated for the effect of dividend yield on stock price. We discussed how h igh dividends increase share value theory (or the so -called “bird -in-the- hand” argument), and low dividends incr ease share value theory (the tax -preference argument) . However, in Brazil there is no difference in taxes between reinvested earnings and dividends paid, which weakens the tax-preference argument for low dividends. Empirical evidence for the Brazilian stoc k market, as previously discussed, follows suit. Moreover, high dividends are also expected to increase stock price due to signaling, the clientele effects, and the agency cost.", "Hence, we hypothesize that:", "H1: Higher dividend yields are associated to highe r stock prices, ceteris paribus. In the second part of the literature review we discussed how heuristics can affect investments. Based on the anchoring and adjustment biases, we expect that smaller investors may use public indexes as a way to structure the ir portfolios. In the case of dividends, if H1 is true, then investors will tend to invest more in stocks that pay higher dividends, and may use the IDIV index as a proxy, hence we hypothesize:", "H2: Investors use the dividends index as a heuristic to manage their portfolios.", "4 METHODOLOGY", "We collected quarterly observations from the B3 stock exchange using Economatica. We collected data forming a non -balanced panel of 4,218 quarterly observations of 275 firms. Then we performed a series of OLS regressions to assess whether the dividend yields are associated to higher stock returns (H1). Our specification is as follows: Thus, our dependent variable (DV) is the price adjusted (after dividend payout). Our independent variable (IV) of interest is the dividends paid by the firm over its total equity (as to scale the variable). We use the total assets of the f irm and its earnings per share as control variables. Additionally, we employ quarterly fixed effects ( 𝜃𝑞) and firm -specific fixed effects ( 𝜌𝑖). Lastly, we perform regressions using the natural logarithm of the main DV and IV, as well as winsorizing it at 5%, as to avoid problems with outliers. Table 1 shows the summary statistics of all variables.", "In order to test H2, we collect another set of data, this time using just the companies that are present in IDIV and on IBOV. This allows us to capture the va riation on the dividend index controlling for the variation of the total index, that not only eliminates the alternative explanation that the IBOV index composition was driving our results but also accounts for the rebalancing effects of large ETFs (the bi ggest ETFs on the B3 stock exchange track IBOV). We collected 7 trading days before and after the rebalancing (15 days: -7 to +7) for the 23 firms that are on both indexes, totaling 345 individual observations.", "Our main specification to test H2 is as follo ws:", "Hence, our main DV in this estimation is again the stock price. Our main IV of interest is 𝑑𝑖𝑓𝐼𝐷𝐼𝑉 , which captures the difference in the IDIV index composition, assuming a value of 0 for days -7 to -1, and then takes the value of 𝐼𝐷𝐼𝑉 1𝑞2022 −𝐼𝐷𝐼𝑉 4𝑞2021 for days 0 to +7. Thus, our specification is similar to a DiD estimator, but instead of two levels of treatment (0 vs 1) in the interaction term ( 𝑡𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑡 ∙𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑡 ), the treatment varies in levels. We calculate 𝑑𝑖𝑓𝐼𝐵𝑂𝑉 in a similar manner and use it as a control variable.

In both instances, results have lent support to the hypotheses. Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression s were the estimation method employed.", "At first, the literature review summarized the main theoretical arguments on dividend payouts, then the empirical evidence on the subject, both internationally and in Brazil, and lastly the main behavioral finance pr inciples (biases, in this case) were outlined as a possible explanation for the investor behavior this paper sought out to test. Theoretically, three major stances on dividends can be identified: h igh dividends increase share value theory (or the so -called “bird -in-the- hand” argument), low dividends increase share value theory (the tax -preference argument) , and the dividends irrelevance hypothesis. Empirical evidence, however, has mostly found a positive relationship between dividend payouts and stock pric es (this paper included). Additional explanations to it include signa ling, clientele effects, and agency cost s, and, specifically in Brazil, dividends are tax -exempt for the most part, thus weakening the tax -preference argument for low dividends. The secon d part of the literature review sought to provide possible rationales for the hypothesized behavior in H2. Simply put, due to bounded rationality, investors (low - income individuals, in particular) must instead rely on heuristics in their decision -making. By using a public index composition as a proxy of stock behavior, they’re presumably suffering from the anchoring and adjustment biases, that is, to “anchor” one’s decision in a first piece of salient information (not necessarily relevant) and to make margi nal adjustments from the original reference point.", "To test H1, the dependent variable (DV) was set as the adjusted price (after dividend payout), while the independent variable (IV) was dividends paid by the firm over its total equity (as to scale the vari able). As control variables total assets of the firm, its earnings per share, quarterly fixed effects ( 𝜃𝑞) and firm -specific fixed effects ( 𝜌𝑖) were used. Alternative specifications using the natural logarithm of the main DV and IV, as well as winsoriz ation at 5% were also tested, as to avoid problems with outliers.", "To test H2, the data set was comprised of just the companies that are present in IDIV and on IBOV, thus allowing to capture the variation on the dividend index controlling for the variation of the total index, not only eliminating the alternative explanation that IBOV composition was driving the results but also accounting for rebalancing effects of large ETFs (which tracks IBOV). 7 trading days before and after the rebalancing (15 days: -7 to +7) for the 23 firms that are on both indexes, totaling 345 individual observations were collected, and, to ensure more robustness to the results, three time -windows were tested (-3 and +3, -5 and +5, and the full -7 and +7 days) all leading to the same conclusion. Hence, the main DV to test H2 was again the stock price and daily fixed effects and firm - specific fixed effects were also control variables . The IV of interest was 𝑑𝑖𝑓𝐼𝐷𝐼𝑉 , which captures the difference in the IDIV index composition, bei ng equal to 0 for the days prior to the rebalancing, and then taking the value of 𝐼𝐷𝐼𝑉 1𝑞2022 −𝐼𝐷𝐼𝑉 4𝑞2021 for the next 7 days immediately following it. Thus, the specification is similar to a DiD estimator, but instead of two levels of treatment (0 vs 1) in the interaction term ( 𝑡𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑡 ∙𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑡 ), the treatment varies in levels. 𝑑𝑖𝑓𝐼𝐵𝑂𝑉 was calculated in a similar manner and used as a control variable. As another robustness test, a difference -in-differences (DiD) estimator was also employe d: firms that had a negative change in IDIV were assigned 𝑡𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑡 =0 and those that had a positive change as 𝑡𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑡 =1. The days before and after the index rebalancing were also coded: -7 to -1 as 𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑡 =0 and between 0 and 7 as 𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑡 =1. Thus, the coefficient of an interaction term 𝑡𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑡 ∙𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑡 captured the difference of the groups in the differences of before and after. This estimation also led to qualitatively similar results.", "Essentially, as a contribution to the body of work on the to pic, the estimation results have lent support to both H1 and H2, i.e., dividend payout positively affects stock prices, and an increase (decrease) in a stock’s share in the dividend index (IDIV) composition has a positive (negative) effect on its price, th us suggesting the index’s role as a proxy to investors. It must be stressed, however, the results are limited to this sample, even though they’re consonant with the extant literature, both theoretically and empirically. Additionally, future research could surely broaden the dataset’s scope and/or test for different model specifications, variables and/or estimation methods as to further confirm these results."]}

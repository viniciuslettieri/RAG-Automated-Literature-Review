INTRODUCTION", "1.1 CHRONOLOGY", "Organ transplantation (OT) is a safe and effective therapeutic alternative to treat a wide array of diseases, increasing patient life quality and perspective (ABTO - Brazilian Association of Organ Transplantation and Donation, 2020). This surgical technique uses organs from a donor to replace a failing organ in a rece ptor with the procedure restoring the receptor ’s physical function , while still ensuring recipient survival (ADOTE - Brazilian Alliance for Organ and Tissues Donation, 2008 apud Siqueira et. al., 2018). This medical procedure originated from ancient Greek, Rom an, Chinese , and Indian civilizations (Bezinover and Saner, 2019). In the beginning the procedure was more of a clinical experiment (Linden, 2008). Only at the end of the nineteenth century did the procedure beg in to be well documented and the research in the field start ed being more systematic (Bezinover and Saner, 2019).", "At the beginning of the twentieth century, Jaboulay and Carrel developed the techniques necessary to conduct vascular anastomoses , which became a turn in OT history (Watson and Dark, 2012). Carrel also established a transplantation model for animals and performed a series of kidney transplants. The French surgeon was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1912 for his pioneer work (Bezinover and Saner, In the first half of the twentieth century a series of kidney transplants are performed in humans, although medicine was not able to deal with rejection, and three weeks was the longest time that a recipient survived after a transplant. The first successful kidney transplant happened between identical twins by Dr. Joseph Murray and Dr. John Merrill at The Peter Bent Brigham Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts in 1954 . The receptor survived 8 years after the procedure (Linden, 2008).", "The surgical practice was introduced i n Brazil in the year of 1964. The organ transplant was a kidney and it took place in the State of Rio de Janeiro in Servidores’ Hospital (Noronha et. al., 1997). Since then, techniques to increase the success of the surgical procedure have been developed and its participation in the treatment of end -stage organ failure diseases has become one of the most successful chapters in the history of", "medicine (Garcia, V, 20 00) with the potential to save the lives of millions of people around the world suffering from organ failure diseases.", "1.2 CONTEXTUALIZATION", "There are millions of people around the world suffering from end -stage organ failure that lead to extreme conseq uences ranging from a patient ’s daily dependency on dialysis to even death (Ersoy, Grupta, and Pruett, 2020). Against this backdrop , organ donation and transplantation can save countless lives (Monis and Waqar, 2020). Compar ed to other treatment alternativ es, the procedure has better survival outcomes on average . For patients with kidney failure , it is better than dialysis that demands a lot of time in the patient's routine, which may disturb the person's other daily activities, including the possibility of work ing (Ersoy, Grupta , and Pruett, 2020). Kidney transplantation also cost less them dialysis and peritoneal dialysis with respective savings reaching BRL 37,000 and BRL 74,000 (Silva et. al., 2016).", "However, the organ donation and transplantation (ODT) procedure can be a victim of its success (Simpkin et al. , 2009). The reason for Simpkin ’s declaration is pointed out by many authors —the demand for organs exceeds their supply (Hoste et. al., 2016 and another four papers). In the United States, approximate ly 170,000 citizens await organ transplantation and 7,300 people die each year waiting for an organ (U.S. Government Information on Organ Donation and Transplantation, 2021; Donate Life, 2021). In Europe, there were 150,000 patients on the waiting list in 2020 , and the number of people who died while on the waiting list for an organ reached 6,000 (Council of Europe – COE, 2021). In Brazil, according to the Brazilian Association of Organ Transplantation and Donation (ABTO), there were more than 42,000 Brazilians on a waiting list for an organ in 2020, while in the same year 9 ,968 people died waiting for a solid organ. The gap in the demand -supply curve is due to mainly two reasons: first, the number of organs donated is not sufficient; and second, there is a low utilization rate of donated organs in the transplantation process (Cruz, 2019; U.K. Health Secretaries, 2020, Genç, 2008). Because organ donation and transplantation sometimes represent s the only alternative for patients that have terminal organ failure (Figueiredo, Pergola -Marconato , and Saidel, 2020) , many studies have been conducted in order to increase the number of organs donated and diminish the gap between the demand and supply of this valuable", "resource. Over the years some efforts have bee n made by government, educational, and medical organizations to increase organ donation, and these efforts have brought good results in the US . In 2019, the number of deceased donors increased by 10.7% with donation s continu ing to expand in 2020 when it grew by 6% even with the coronavirus pandemic (OPTN - Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network, 2019 -2020). In Brazil, the results are also positive and the number of effective donors increased from 1,898 in 2010 to 3,768 in 2019, representing a 98% inc rease in ten years (RBT|ABTO 2010 -2019) , but t he year 2020 was an exception due to the Coronavirus pandemic. Out of 3,330 effective donors registered between January and December 2020, 2 ,789 end ed up being transplanted. Even if this is an optimistic result , it is not enough to equal the demand and offer curve. The number of donated organs has increased over the years, but the supply is not increasing as much as possible because organ waste has raised and people are dying waiting for a transplantation.", "In the US , where 20 people die each day waiting for an organ (Donate life, 2021), 60% of the heart s and lung s donated are wasted per year (Brabaw, 2017), and the kidney discard rate between 2004 and 2014 was 17 .9% of the 156,089 kidneys recovered in that period (Aubert, 2019. Rodriguez, 2019). In Brazil the mortality of people on the waiting list in 2020 was 27 people per day and the wastage rate was approximately 16.25% , and unfortunately this index has been growing over the years ( Table 1) . In 2011 it was 1 .4% (RBT|ABTO, 2011 -2020) and even though there is a waste of donated organs, there is a small number of studies focused on decreasing this waste.", "Table 1 - Effective d onors that did not become transplanted donors Year Effective Donors Donors We Organs Transplanted Wastage rate* (%)", "*Wastage rate = (Effective Donors -Transplanted Donors) / Effective donors Source: RBT|ABTO, 2011 -2020 Organ transplantation is a complex operation that needs to confront another challenge: organ wastage. Figueiredo, Pergola -Marconato, and Saidel (2020) highlighted logistical problems and medical contraindications that narrow the effective offer of organs in Brazil. The first one hinders the effective cap ture and distribution of organs , while the second discards organs consider ed to be inadequate by medical criteria.", "1.3 RESEARCH QUESTION", "It is important to reach efficiency in ODT because the right use of resources can help improve the results of the operation , and when we are talking about ODT , the outcomes are lives spared and quality of live for patients that have been suffering from terminal diseases. There is an index that can measure efficiency over time, the Malmquist index , that has two factors : the catch -up effect and the frontier -shift effect. The first one measure s the change in productivity re lated to managerial practices applied in the organizations analyzed . The second one computes how the productivity var ies over time regarding the technol ogy that ha s been used in the process. Considering that most solid organs in Brazil are transplanted by its Unified Health System(SUS), in 2018 this number reached 90% and of the limitation of resources to improving the OD T technology , we chose to focus on investigate managerial practices applied to increase ODT efficiency , although we do not ignore the efficiency brought by change s in technology improvement . The model of analyses chosen is Leavitt’s Diamond model that also contemplates the dimension of technology along with the dimension of people, process , and structure in order to analy ze changes brought by ODT managerial practices. We also evaluate the ODT efficiency of each Brazilian State to understand its efficiency at a country level . We believe that the first step to ward improv ing efficiency is to first know which initiatives have been successfully applied and to what degree of efficiency.", "So, l ooking from the opti cs of efficiency , this study aims to contribute by helping the Brazilian States reach a better efficiency level in their ODT operation s by using better the organs donated and diminishing the waste of this valuable resource so as to save more lives. So, to help the Brazili an States achieve this result , we chose to focus this study on identify ing which managerial practices have been applied in ODT around the world and also evaluate how efficient the Brazilian States are in their utilization of donated organs. When l ooking at literature , many studies have been conducted to bring the number of donated organs closer to the number of patients waiting for a transplant. When we looked for systematic reviews, we identified 36 studies related to the donation - transplantation process . Overall, most of the previous reviews focus on attitude and family consent to increase the number of donated organs (Figueiredo et al., 2020; Monis et al., 2020 ; and other papers). There are previous reviews focused on clinical aspects that can affect or gan recipients (Aziz et al., 2020 and Cowan et al ., 2018 , among others) , and some previous studies focused on managerial aspects of the ODT process such as the quality process (Bret et al., 2016; Siqueira et al., 2018; Ferraz et al., 2013; and Perez - Protto , et al., 2009), the use of technology to improve it (Niazkhani et al., 2017 and Khazaee et al., 2016), or mapping the best pathways in the ODT process (Ferraz at. Al., 2011) . However, we did not identify any former review focused on analyzing articles dealing with possible managerial practices to increase the utilization of donated organs. On the side of evaluatin g efficiency, we identified that there are four previous studies focus ed on evaluat ing the efficiency of organ donation and transplantation in Brazil that focus on investigat ing the gap between the number of potential donors and the number of transplants performed. Marinho and Araujo (2021) assessed the efficiency of the Brazilian states in transforming potential organ donors into actual donation s. They applied DEA in conjunction with the bootstrap technique using organ transplantation data from 2018. Siqueira and Araujo (2018) applied DEA and Malmquist index models to investigate the Brazilian public services of kidney transplantation from 2013 t o 2015. Likewise, Costa et al . (2012 -2014) used DEA and Malmquist index models to evaluate the efficiency of the Brazilian States regarding the public kidney transplant system and their productivity trends from 2006 to 2011. Finally, Marinho and Cardoso (2 007) evaluated the efficiency of the organ transplantation procedures in Brazil using the transplant expenses as inputs and the quantities of the various organs transplanted as output measures. Their interest was to investigate changes in efficiency over t ime and", "identify trends in performance from 1995 to 2003. All these studies applied the output - oriented DEA model.", "Due to the relevance of the theme for the society that is undeniable since improving the utilization of donated organs can save thousands of lives by raising the supply of suitable organs and decreasing the time patients spend on the waiting list (Walker, Broderick, and Sque, 2013) and the lack of studies focus ed on diminishing the wastage of organs , the objective of the study is to investigate the donated organ wastage by answer ing two questions:", "1) Which managerial practices have been adopted to increase the utilization rate of donated organs?", "2) What is the degree of technical and scale efficiency of the Brazilian states in the utilization of donated organs in the period from 2012 to 2020?

The first one, the donation phase, starts when a potential donor is identified and finishes when the organ is removed from the donor and becomes available for transplantation. The second phase, transplantation, starts when the first one finishes, so when the organ becomes av ailable for transplantation , it is the beginning of the transplantation phase and will be completed when the organ is transplanted into the recipient through surgery. Each phase has its own challenges and needs to be the focus of research and public policy . However, most of the studies about organ donation and", "transplantation focus on the donation part of the ODT process . This research aims to fill the gap of existing research with a focus on the second phase of the process : transplantation.", "Another contrib ution of this research is related to the type of donors whose data will be analyzed . This study focuses on deceased donor organs because in Brazil they are the main source of organs (Westhpal et al., 2016) and a single deceased donor can save up to eight l ives (OPTN - Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network, 2021) because this person can donate one heart, two lungs, one liver, one pancreas, two kidneys, and one intestine. A deceased donor is a person who died from brain death and after that a surgical procedure removes the organs from this donor and the organs need to be preserved and transplanted to recipients that are dying due to end-stage organ failure (Monis and Waqar, 2020).", "The transplantation operation must be highly efficien t because the reso urce is very perishable. Brain death triggers hemodynamic changes that lead to progressive deterioration of organs within a few hours, making them rapidly unviable for transplantation (ABTO, 2009). A clinical exam, an apnea test, a complimentary exam, and documental pro of is necessary for diagnosing a brain death in Brazil (Westhpal et al., 2016). The diagnosis must follow the Medical counsel's regulation number This study also focuses on solid organs. The medical dictionary defines a solid organ as “An internal organ that has a firm tissue consistency and is neither hollow (such as the organs of the gastrointestinal tract) nor liquid (such as blood). In Brazil the solid organs that can be donated by a deceased donor are heart, lung, ki dney , liver and pancreas. They comprise more than 50% of the transplants performed in Brazil. In 2020, 7 ,227 solid organs were transplanted out of a total of 14 ,354 transplants performed. The last delimitation of the research is the focus on the organs tra nsplanted by the Unified Health System (SUS) , one of the largest public health networks in the world benefiting about 180 million Brazilians and a reference in organ donation and transplantation , who responsible for 90% of the solid organs transplanted in 2018 (Soares et. al., 2020) and performed more than 62,000 transplants in 2020 (Corrál, 2021).", "1.5 STUDY STRUCTURE", "This study is organized in four chapters .

Methodology: The studies were classified considering four cr itical dimensions of management practices: structure, people, process, and technology (Conboy et al., 2020; Vidgen, Shaw , and Grant, 2017) after search ing five databases in March 2021. Findings: The search returned 2,166 articles and 14 were selected and a nalyzed in this review. Most of the articles were developed in the US (7/14, 50%). Most of the managerial practices adopted to improve the utilization of donated organs are related to process improvement ( 10/14, 71%), 14% (2/14) described practices related to the implementation of technology, one article (7%) was classified as a structure dimension.

There are few studies dedicated to research ing the implementation of managerial practices to improve the donation -transplantation process. This study's relevance to society is undeniable since thousands of people are waiting for a donated organ. To academia, the study is essential due to the lack of p ublications on this topic.

INTRODUCTION", "Organ transplantation is sometimes the only solution for patients suffering from ter minal illnesses (Figueiredo et al., 2020; Westphal et al., 2016). This procedure improves the quality of life and increases the life perspective of patients with organ failure (Yang et al., 2020; ABTO, 2020). However, there is a gap between the demand and supply of organs for transplantation and an increase in the need for donated organs worldwide (Araujo et al., 2021; Scheuher, 2016). In the United States, approximately 170,000 citizens await organ transplantation, and 7,300 people die each year waiting fo r an organ (US Government Information on Organ Donation and Transplantation, 2021; Donate Life, 2021). In Europe, in 2020, there were 150,000 patients on the waiting list, and the number of people who died while on the waiting list for an organ reached 6,000 (Council of Europe – COE, 2021). The gap in the demand -supply curve is due mainly to two reasons: first, the number of organs donated is not sufficient; and second, there is a low utilization rate of donated organs in the transplantation process (Cruz, 2019; UK Health Secretaries, 2020, Genç, 2008).", "Some efforts have been made over the years by the government, educational, and medical organizations to increase organ donation , and these efforts have brought good results in the US . In 2019, the number of deceased donors increased by 10.7% with donations continuing to expand in 2020 when it grew by 6% even with the coronavirus pandemic (OPTN - Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network, 2019 -2020). However, some donat ed organs do go to waste and a small number of studies have focused on decreasing this waste of donated organs. In the US where 20 people die each day waiting for an organ (Donate life, 2021), 60% of the heart s and lung s donated are wasted per year (Brabaw, 2017), and the kidney discard rate between 2004 and 2014 was 17.9% (Aubert, 2019.

We identified 36 systematic literature reviews related to the donation -transplantation process.

In turn, some previous studies have focused on managerial aspects of the organ donation -transplantation (ODT) process such as the", "quality process (Bret et al. , 2016; Siqueira et al. , 2018; Ferraz et al. , 2013; and Perez - Protto, et al. , 2009), the use of technology to improve it (Niazkhani et al., 2017 and Khazaee et al. , 2016), or mapping the best pathways in the ODT process (Ferraz at. Al., 2011) . However, we did not identify any former review focused on analyzing articles dealing with possible managerial practices to increase the utilization of donated organs. For this reason, this article aims to fill this academic gap by systematicall y reviewing the literature to identify the management practices implemented to increase the utilization of donated organs from deceased donors.", "The authors (I and my advisor Claudia Affonso ) analyzed and classified the managerial practices implemented considering the classical Diamond Organizational Model (Leviatt, 1965) and the four critical dimensions of management practices: structure, people, process, and technology (Conboy et al., 2020; Vidgen, Shaw, and Grant, 2017). The structure dimension covers the team hierarchy, how the staff is organized, and the workflow (Yap, C. S., 1990). The people dimension relates to the staff involved in developing a product or service, and their beliefs, a ttitudes, and knowledge regarding the process are important (Coffie, Boaten, and Asombala, 2018). The process dimension contemplates how the operations are executed to transform inputs into outputs, the necessary routine, and procedures (Yap, 1990). Finall y, the technology dimension is related to tools that can help execute the work (Okunoye and Bertaux, 2006). The social relevance of researching possible managerial practices for improv ing the utilization of donated organs is undeniable since it can save thousands of lives by raising the supply of suitable organs and decreasing the time patients spend on the waiting list (Perez -Protto at al., 2022 ).

(2000) , Tolchinsky et al., 2006 and Steinberger, Douglas and Kirschbaum (2009) adopted a qualitative approach. Ersoy, Gupta , and Pruett (2021) evaluated the ODT process in the US and highlighted the importance of coordinati ng the operation to avoid the wastage of donated organs. In turn, Savaser et al. (2019) used a mathematical model to optimize the ODT process in Turkey. The authors used the model to analyze the allocation of organs in intra -regional transpla nts to meet the time limits of each organ and increase the number of organs transplanted. Likewise, Rajmohan et al. (2017) applied a mathematical model to improve the logistics of the ODT process in India. These authors aimed to identify the best place to localize the organ distribution centers to minimize the distance between donors and recipients and avoid waste organs in the transportation stage. Finally, Ghirardini et al. (2000) established two indexes to measure the efficiency of the ODT process in the US: the procurement index to evaluate the efficiency of utilizing organs retrieved from suitable donors, and the transplant index to assess the transplant team's capacity to use available organs. Both indexes offer a measure of the ODT efficiency and allow improvement in organ allocation.", "Talebi et al. (2017) developed an algorithm based on a mathematical model and simulated an optimal allocation model that decreases the distribution center construction costs and transportation time. Therefor e, the model allows a better service in Malaysia and helps diminish organ waste. Zahiri et al. (2014) developed a model and a simulation to analyze the best location of health facilities used in ODT in Iran. The model considered the perishability and diffe rences among organs. Besides, Belin et al. (2013) focused on minimizing the time necessary in the ODT process after the organ removal to avoid the waste related to ischemia time. Bruni et al. (2006) conducted a study in Italy to prevent the waste of donate d organs due to perishability with the model also address ing the equity problem of allocation organs.", "Snell et al.

Consequently, Australia reached one of the highest rates of transplants in the world. The authors highlighted that communication, feedback, and qualified coordination contributed to the program's success.", "Tolchischy et al. (2006) is the only article in the process dimension that does not focus specifically on logistics. They developed an agent -based architecture model called Carrel that help physicians choose the best recipient to receive the organ, improving the ODT process and increasing the number of organs transplanted.", "In the paper written by Steinberger, Douglas and Kirschbaum (2009 ), the authors focused on applying the Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) method to improve the ODT process reliability, efficiency, and safety. Their study was conducted in the US and applied the FMEA method to identify the contributing factors for risks in the ODT process, isolate primary causes, and act to reduce future risks. Based on the outcomes of the FMEA, the team changed the work process and improved it.", "b) Practices related to the Technology dimension:", "One article brought an application that allows better communication among the team working in ODT (Pahl et al., 2020) , while another other study investigated how a data- driven design can help improve the quality of ODT operations (Hamilton, 2008). Pahl et al. (2020) developed a mobile application to improve the quality of communication among the ODT team. As a result, the reports showed an increase in 35% of organs transplanted. The importance of the app in the operation is undeniable since 30% to 61% of o rgans donated were wasted because of problems related to coordination and communication. In turn, Hamilton (2008) created a quality system to improve the performance of transplant centers. The system allows the documentation of failures and enables faster actions to solve problems, knowing that time is crucial in the ODT process. c) Practices related to the People dimension:", "None article was classified as a managerial practice applied to people dimension, although all the dimensions are interdependent and the changes in the other ones affect the transplant team and staff evolved in the process, this lack of papers in this dimension", "shows that maybe there is a gap of research in managerial practices applied to improve the utilization rate of donated organs . Also there is a risk of the research term used in this study could not identified papers in this dimension. d) Practices related to the Structure dimension:", "Only one article was classified in the structure dimension (Karatz et al., 2007). The study shed light on the crucial role of transplant coordinators in Greece. This country established trained coordinators in the local, regional, and clinical levels in 2005. As a result, the rate of cadaveric organs transplanted grew 38% in 2005 compared to the previous year. The authors state that the coordinator was vital in this success because they were qualified and helped maintain the organs in the best condition for transplantation.", "4. CONCLUSION", "This study systematically reviewed the literature to identify managerial practices that can be implemented to increase the utilization of organs donated from deceased donors. The managerial procedures were classified into four dimensions: structure, peopl e, process, or technology.", "The results highlight that very few studies are dedicated to this theme since only 14 out of 2,166 articles (0.6%) were focused on managerial practices to improve organ utilization. Most managerial procedures implemented to incr ease organ utilization are related to the process dimension. These practices were usually applied to address logistical and allocation issues considering the high perishability of donated organs. The managerial practices classified in the technology dimens ion are experiences that use information management to promote change and increase ODT efficiency. The managerial practices classified in the structure dimension shed light on the value of a qualified ODT coordinator to manage the team and the process. Las tly, there were a lack of studies classified in the people dimension that shows a gap in research about managerial practices to improve the utilization rate of donated organs, as for example the importance of training the team to increase knowledge and commitment to the ODT process.", "This study has some limitations that should be observed. There is the risk of overlooking some valuable literature (Greenfield and Braithwaite, 2008) such as stud ies that were not published in peer -reviewed journals or were not indexed in the electronic databases", "search ed in this review. Likewise, the search terms adopted in this research may not have captured relevant studies. Another limitation is that the studie s selected comprised distinct research contexts and methods, hindering a statistical meta -analysis (Hinchcliff, Greenfield, Moldovan, 2012). Despite these limitations, this study is essential for academics due to the lack of publications on this topic. The refore, systematizing the existing knowledge on the subject can help identify research gaps and stimulate future studies. For practitioners and public managers, this research highlights managerial practices that can be adopted to reduce the waste of donate d organs. Also, the relevance of this study to society is undeniable since thousands of people are waiting for a donated organ. In this scenario, increasing the utilization of donated organs can offer these people a chance at life .", "Future studies can furt her investigate the implementation of the management practices presented in this review. It is also necessary to research this topic in Latin America and Africa considering the lack of studies from these continents. Besides, as this review focused on solid organs donated from deceased donors, a future systematic review could focus on living donors or tissue donation.", "5.

PAPER 2 - A DEA EVALUATION OF THE UTILIZATION RATE OF DONATED ORGANS IN BRAZIL", "Abstract: Organ transplantation (OT) is a safe and effective therapeutic alternative to treat many diseases, increasing patient quality of life and saving lives. It sometimes represents the only alternative for patients with termi nal organ failure, and studies have been conducted to increase the number of donated organs and diminish the gap between the demand and supply of this valuable resource. Although the number of donated organs has grown over the years, the supply is not incr easing as much as possible because of organ wastage. This study aims to assess the degree of technical and scale efficiency of Brazilian states in utilizing all solid organs donated to transplant from 2012 to 2020. To do so, we applied DEA and Malmquist in dex models in conjunction with the bootstrap technique to analyze data obtained from the Brazilian Registry of Transplants. The results indicate that the average score of efficiency is around 0 .7 to 0 .8, which means that there is 20% to 30% of improvement in Brazilian States.", "KEY WORDS: Donated organs utilization, Organ donation and transplantation, DEA, Efficiency, Cadaveric organs.", "1. INTRODUCTION", "Organ transplantation is a safe and effective therapeutic alternative to treat many diseases and can represent the main therapeutic alternative for patients with chronic diseases and terminal organs [1]. This surgical technique uses organs from a donor to replace a failing organ in a receptor, restoring his/her physical function s [2]. However, the or gan donation and transplantation (ODT) procedure can be a victim of its success as the demand for organs exceeds their supply worldwide [3; 4]. The gap in the demand - supply curve is due to mainly two reasons: first, the number of donated organs is not sufficient , and second, there is a low utilization rate of donated organs in the transplantation process [5; 6; 7].", "In the US, where 20 people die each day waiting for a donated organ [8], 60% of the heart s and lung s donated are wasted per year [9], and the kidney discard rate between 2004 and 2014 was 17.9% of the 156,089 kidneys recovered in that period [10; 11]. In", "Europe in 2020 there were 150,000 patients on the waiting list and the number of people who died while on the waiting list for an organ reached 6,000 [12]. Likewise, in Brazil, a country of continental dimensions that has the most extensive public transplant program globally and ranks second in the number of transplants performed after the US [2], the waiting time for an organ usually exceeds one year , but may reach nine years for a liver and more than eleven years for a kidney [1]. In this country, the mortality rate of people on the waiting list in 2020 was 27 people per day with the wastage rate increas ing over the years . In 2011 it was 1.4%, while in 2020 16.25% of the donated organs were wasted and not transplanted to those that need an organ to survive [13].", "Government s and medical organizations worldwide have made some efforts to increase organ dona tion. In the US, the efforts have achieved good results: in 2019 the number of deceased donors increased 10.7% and in 2020 the donation continued to expand and grew 6% even during the coronavirus pandemic. Similarly, academic research [14] has focused main ly on investigating how to increase the number of donated organs. Some studies have examined family consent to donate the organs of a deceased relative [15; 16; among others], while others have focused on applying managerial or technological tools to impro ve the ODT process [2; 17; 18; 19; and 20]. Regarding efficiency analysis, [21] conducted a systematic literature review in both health and management databases and identified that the efficiency of ODT processes is mostly assessed using indicators /ratios of a single input to a single output. However, Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) is a non -parametric mathematical model that has been commonly applied to estimate the efficiency of healthcare processes [22 and 23]. DEA is a good option to analyze efficiency in public healthcare because the model can use variables with different measure units, which are very common in complex public programs [24] .", "Yet, despite the theme's relevance, there are still few studies focused on measuring the efficiency of the ODT process through the DEA model, and the previous studies usually focus on investigating the gap between the number of potential donors and the final number of transplants performed.", "[25] focused on the ODT process in the United States using the numbers of kidneys and extrarenal retrieved as output. Still in the USA, [16] combined DEA and artificial neural networks to predict the organ recipient func tional status. In turn, [27] applied DEA to assess the efficiency of kidney allocation in Iran. There are also some studies conducted in Brazil to evaluate efficiency levels by state regarding the ODT", "process [1; 2; 28; 29]. [1] assessed the efficiency of the Brazilian states in transforming potential organ donors into actual donations. They applied DEA in conjunction with the bootstrap technique using organ transplantation data from 2018. [2] applied DEA and Malmquist index models to investigate the Brazil ian public services of kidney transplantation from 2013 to 2015. Likewise, [28] used DEA and Malmquist index models to evaluate the efficiency of the Brazilian States regarding the public kidney transplant system and their productivity trends from 2006 to 2011. Finally, [29] evaluated the efficiency of the organ transplantation procedures in Brazil using the transplant expenses as inputs and the quantities of the various organs transplanted as output measures. Their interest was to investigate changes in ef ficiency over time and identify trends in performance from 1995 to 2003. All these studies applied the output -oriented DEA model.", "As can be observed, none of the previous studies has focused on the efficiency regarding the utilization of donated organs ( diminishing their wastage ) as we have proposed in this research. Therefore, this study aims to assess the degree of technical and scale efficiency of Brazilian states in utilizing all solid donated organs from 2012 to 2020: kidneys, liver, heart, lungs, and pancreas.", "To do that we applied DEA and Malmquist index models in conjunction with the bootstrap technique to analyze data obtained from the Brazilian Registry of Transplants (RBT). The inputs are (1) the number of effective donors (per million population - pmp) and (2) the number of teams that performed transplants during the year pmp (heard, kidney, liver and pancreas ). The number of effective donors represents the number of organs that have been retrieved from a donor. The number of teams that performed transplants during the year represents the human resources available to accomplish the organ transplantation. In turn, the output is the number of organ transplants performed during the year pmp (heard, kidney, liver and pancreas ) [1; 2]. Following the pr evious studies on the theme and considering that the objective is to increase the number of organs transplanted, the efficiency model in this study is output oriented .", "This study aims to contribute to the healthcare performance literature by providing new empirical evidence on the ODT efficiency regarding donated organ utilization, a theme not yet explored in this field. This study also includes the complete population of Brazilian States, avoiding sample bias, and analy zes high -quality data obtained from a n official source – the Brazilian Registry of Transplants (RBT). Thus, this study enriches", "this scarce literature and stimulates the application of DEA on this vital topic. Furthermore, besides the academic relevance, considering the Brazilian reality of s carce resources and poor infrastructure, this research can help public managers and decision - makers identify inefficiencies and compare the performance of the states regarding donated organ utilization.", "2. METHOD", "Data envelopment analysis is a mathematical method that compares decision making units (DMUs) with similar production processes , which are units using the same type of inputs to generate similar outputs [30] . A DMU classified as technically efficient has a DEA score equal to 1 and a w aste- free productive process, which means that there is no room for improvement in resource allocation. In turn, scores greater than 0 and less than 1 designate inefficient units. The DEA model has been widely applied and accepted since it was proposed in the 1970s . One of the model's advantages is that it can measure efficiency without relating it to market prices, thus being suitable for measuring public services such as health and education services [31 ; 32].", "As in the prior studies about the ODT process efficiency, this study aims to increase the number of organs transplanted while maintaining constant input levels , so that is why the output -oriented DEA model was adopted as it wants to maximize z0 expanding the outputs levels until achieving the optimal value of z0. Subject to:", "z0: Efficiency of the DMU in analyz ing the output -oriented model.", "y = vector of outputs under analyses x = vector of inputs under analyses 𝑆𝐼− = Slack of inputs 𝑆𝑅+ = Slack of outputs Another important DEA specification is the type of returns to scale: constant returns to scale (CRS) or variable returns to scale (VRS). CRS models developed by [33] assume that an increase in the input will lead to a proportional increase in the output. By contrast, VRS models proposed by [34] assume that an increase in the input m ay be accompanied by a greater than proportional (increasing returns to scale - IRS) or less than proportional (decreasing returns to scale - DRS) increase in the output. Both methods were computed, compared, and used to calculate scale efficiency (SE) in this research, as in [2]. SE is the ratio of the technical efficiency (measured through the CR S model) and the pure technical efficiency (measured by the VRS model). Therefore, SE estimates the impact of scale on the efficiency of a DMU.", "An SE equal to 1 signals a DMU operating at an optimum scale size. In turn, an SE greater than 0 and less than 1 indicates scale inefficiency, which can be determined by the sum of the weights in the CRS model specifications [35] .", "2.1 VARIABLES AND DATA SOURCE", "The two inputs selected for this research are as follows: (a) Number of effective donors (pmp) (b) Number of teams available to perform transplants during the year pmp (heard, kidney, liver and pancreas ) In turn, the output is the number of organ transplants performed during the year pmp ( heard, kidney, liver and pancreas ). The number of effective donors represents the number of donors from which at least one solid organ was removed for transplantation . Therefore, it illustrates the minimum", "number of organs available to donate. The number of teams that performed transplants during the year represents the human resources available to transplant organs in each Brazilian state. The output represents the nu mber of organs transplanted that year [1; 2]. The DMUs are 18 Brazilian states and the Federal District. Nine Brazilian states were excluded from the analysis for lack of data.", "The source of data used in this study is the Brazilian Registry of Transplants (RBT) produced by the Brazilian Association of Organ Transplantation (ABTO), editions 2012 to 2020. Regarding reliability, ABTO is a well -known and respected association in Brazil . Although it is a private organization, ABTO is vastly adopted as source of data including by the public sector in Brazil and it is also the primary source of all studies previously conducted for the theme of ODT in the country.", "2.2 SOFTWARE AND BOOTSTRAPPING", "The software used to calculate the efficiencies in R was Benchmarkin g, so the efficiency scores were inverted to facilitate data visualization since this software computes scores that vary between one and infinity. We considered the classical variation between zero to one.", "DEA is a positively biased estimator , which mean s that the model calculates an efficiency score superior to the actual efficiency of the DMUs [31]. To avoid bias we calculated the efficiency through the bootstrapping method proposed by [36] using the package boot on R.", "2.3 MALMQUIST INDEX", "To measure variations in DMU productivity between two consecutive periods (t and t + 1), we adopted the Malmquist index, the most popular approach to dynamic evaluation, using the software nonparaeff on R [2; 31].", "Figure 1- Dynamic change of performance and technology", "Source: Elaborated by Bogetoft and Ott , 2011, page 42.", "The formula of the Malmquist index is as follows :", "M = Malmquist index t = period of time equal to t+1 (or more) t0 = reference period of time E(t,t0) = measure of the performance of DMU in period t0 against the technology in period t E(t0,t0) = measure of the performance of DMU in period t0 against the technology in period t0 .", "If the firm became more efficient so the result will be greater than 1 because E(t,t0) > E(t0,t0). So when there is an increase in DMU’s efficiency over time the Malmquist index (M) will be more than 1 when the model is output oriented , oppositely when DMU become less inefficient in a period in the present as it was in the past the M will be less than one. So if a DMU has an efficiency equal to 0,6 in period t and 0,3 in period t0 this means that this DMU productivity doubled in this time interval and the M is equal to 2.", "In a model input orient ed the Malmquist Index will be less than 1 when there is a increase in efficiency over time.", "The Malmquist index is a product of two factors: the catch -up effect or efficiency change (EC) and frontier -shift effect or technical change (TC) . The firs t factor computes the change regarding managerial practices applied in a DMU over time. While the second one measures the change in productivity related to changes in the technology used in process dynamic in time.

One limitation is regarding the transplant teams, an input variable that computes the number of people in the group but says nothing about the trai ning of these people, who can directly impact the efficiency of the process. Another limitation is regarding DEA results that depend on the variables used. It is important to highlight that although this study provides insights of ODT and DMU s as peers, it is necessary to be cautious first because the DMUs are efficient in relation to the others in the model, and second the success of DEA depends on the variables chosen for the model.

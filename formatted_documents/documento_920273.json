The low cell density of anae robic fermentation, the high cost of culture medium and the low mass transfer in gas-liquid systems were the three main point s approached in this study. An extensive review of Clostridium species used as biocatalyst in biochemical or hybrid processes was p erformed, showing the main substrates and products generated by this important genus of anaerobic bacteria. Clostridium carboxidivorans can be highlighted for its ability to use gaseous feedstock as syngas, obtained from gasification or pyrolysis of waste material or directly from industrial waste gas, to produce ethanol, butanol and hexanol. The efficiency of carbon conversion in syngas fermentation is directly related to the composition of this feedstock and it was also widely reviewed in the present work . Syngas composition is a complex function of biomass composition, gasification parameter, type of gasifier and/or, the presence of contaminants in industrial waste gases. Literature data compiled in these two reviews showed the technical viabi lity but also the challenges and opportunities of this technology. They highlighted the need for R&D investment to improve syngas fermentation technology until its industrial application become s feasible. Aiming to increase biomass and ethanol production in serum bottle fermentation , a sequence of experimental design was performed based on ATCC® 2713 culture medium. A minimum culture medium ideal to cell growth was proposed , herein called TYA (Tryptone -Yeast Extract -Arginine), that increased biomass concent ration by 77% and reduced medium cost by 47 %. The TPYGarg (Tryptone -Peptone -Yeast Extract -Glucose -Arginine) medium was identified for ethanol production, showing an increase of more than 4-fold in ethanol concentration and a cost reduction of 31%. In the attempt to improve the mass transfer of gas eous substrates in liquid phase, we proposed the addition of Tween® 80 to ATCC® 2713 culture medium in serum bottles fermentation. This approach increased ethanol production by 200% with the addition of 0.15% (v/v) of the surfactant to the culture medium. The process was reproduced in stirred tank bioreactor with continuous syngas low flow and a maximum ethanol productivity of 0.05 g/L.h was achieved.", "Rio de Janeiro November/2021", "iii", "RESUMO Produção de etanol e butanol por Clostridium carboxidivorans através da fermentação de gás de síntese: uma tecnologia promissora", "CAROLINA SANTOS GIORDANI BENEVENUTI", "Orientadores :", "DSc.

In addition, a larger populati on requires greater production of food and consumer goods, also increasing the generation of agricultural and industrial wastes. Besides, the concept of sustainability has been gaining strength around the world in recent decades, making evident the need fo r the development of te chnologies capable of replace the ones based on the exploitation of fossil fuels (CHENG; TIMILSINA, 2011; GEISSDOERFER et al., 2017; REDL et al., 2017) .", "Whether because of its imminent finitude or the environmental issues, the use of fossil sources as a raw material for the generation of energy, fuels and chemicals has been questioned (FERREIRA; MOREIRA; MONTEIRO, 2009; KAMM BIRGIT , KAMM MICHAEL , GRUBER PATRICK, 2006) . In addition to becoming increasingly evident the influence of human action on the worsening of environmental impacts such as those related to the emission of greenhouse gases (HANDLER et al., 2016; REDL In this context, synthesis gas (syngas) fermentation is a possible technology to fuels and chemical production from renewable sources or from agro -industrial waste s. In most studies, this is a hybrid techno logy, characterized by a thermochemical stage of conversion of the raw material into syn gas, followed by a biochemical stage of conversion of the gas substrate into products of interest from the action of biocatalysts, such as bacteria of the genus Clostri dium (CHENG et al., 2019; HEIJSTRA; LEANG; JUMINAGA, 2017; JONES e t al., 2016; REDL et al., 2017; RIBEIRO et al., 2017) . But it can also be characterized by a one -step biochemical process, when the feedstock used is an industrial waste gas stream containing mainly CO, CO 2 and H2. Few microorganisms are able to assimilate CO and CO 2, Clostridium ljungdahlii , Eubacteriumlimosum , Alkalibaculumbacchi , Clostridium rasgdalei , Clostridium carboxidivorans , Acetobacterium woodi i, Clostridium aceticum , Clostridium formicoaceticum , Clostridium autoethanogenum e Clostridium scatologenes are some of the acetogenic species reported in the literature for biofuel production from syngas fermentation, using the Wood -Ljungdhal pathway (ABUBACKAR; VEIGA; KENNES,", "2015; FAST et al., 2015a; FERNÁNDEZ -NAVEIRA et al., 2016b; JONES et al., 2016; LEE et al., 2008; LIU et al., 2014; MARU et al., 2018; REDL et al., 2017) . Although representing a promising technol ogy, syngas fermentation faces several challenges. A current problem of anaerobic processes is the low cell density, which results in low productivity (COELHO et al., 2019) . The medium composition used for autotrophic fermentation usually contain s numerous and expensive compo nents, and the prepar ation require intensive labor (WILKINS; ATIYEH, 2011) . The most used mediums for Clostridium carboxi divorans growth are ATCC® 2713 and ATCC® 1754, although they led to low specific growth rates (PHILLIPS et al., 2015; RAMIÓ -PUJOL et al., 2015a) . Some studies reported the evaluation of trace metals compositi on on product formation (AHLAWAT et al., 2018; SAXENA; TANNER, 2011; SHEN et al., 2017) . However, the cost of these media hasn’t been a concern of these studies. The major technology challenge of syngas fermentation is the low mass transfer of gaseous substrates in liquid phase. Efforts to increase CO/CO 2 mass transfer include the study of different reactor design (DOLL et al., 2018; SHEN; BROWN; WEN, 2014a, 2014b) and the variation of process parameters as agitation speed and gas flow rate (SUN et al., 2019a) . A different approach that can be applied is the addition of chemical agents or vibrations technics in the medium to prom ote fine bubbles in liquid increasing the contact area between phases (ALDRIC et al., 2009; BREDWELL The objective of the present study is to contribute to the development of the technology of syngas fermentation by acetogenic bacteria, as Clostridium carboxidivorans , testing solutions to the main drawbac ks of this promising technology : the low cell density and solvents productivity , the high cost of the bioprocess and, the low mass transfer coefficient of gaseous substrates.", "2 OBJECTIES", "2.1 General objective The general objective of this thesis is the production of ethanol and butanol from the fermentation of synthesis gas using Clostridium carboxidivorans bacteria.", "2.2 Specific objectives", "1.

Water, soil, and air pollution generated by anthropogenic actions have caused climate change, resource depletion, global warming, water crises, and the increase of natur al disasters in recent years (\"Climate Change 2014: Synthe sis Report\", 2014) . Many researchers and initiatives are committed to search and develop new techniques, feedstocks, and processes towards a sustainable economy that will be less dependent on oil as a source of en ergy and chemical production (CHERUBINI, 2010) . One approach is to progressively change our primary source of fuels and chemicals, decreasing the dependency on oil and oil products due to oil’s environmental impact, depletion possibility, and market price oscillations caused by oil and financial crises. The Sustainable Development Goals adopted by global leaders at the 2015 United Nations Summit se t the path for 17 goals to be achieved by 2030, such as: affordable and clean energy (SDG7); industries, innovation and infrastructure (SDG9); responsible production and consumption (SDG12); and climate action Many feedstocks can be used to produce renewable and sustainable fuels and chemicals, especially residual organic materials, industrial waste -streams, and by - products. The use of glycerol, molasses, corn steep liquor, energy crops, grass silage, cattle slurry, harvest re sidues, and food processing waste can reduce operational costs (associated with feedstock acquisition) and environmental impact due to improper disposal of residue (AL SEADI et al., 2013; CHERUBINI, 2010; DROSG et al., 2013; HASSAN; WILLIAMS; JAISWAL, 2019; LATIF et al., 2014 ; MURPHY et al., 2011; SHEN et al., 2015) . These are renewable feedstocks that can be transformed into valuable biofuels (e.g., biobutanol and bioethanol) and biochemicals (lactic acid, butyric acid, and succinic acid), achieving a balance between envir onmental sustainability and economic growth in a process named biorefining (HASSAN; WILLIAMS; JAIS WAL, 2019) . Biorefining is defined as “the sustainable processing of biomass into a spectrum of marketable food and feed ingredients, bio -based products (chemicals, materials) and bioenergy (biofuels, power and/or heat)” (IEA", "Chapter 2 BIOENERGY, 2014) . In a biorefinery, components of biomass are organized a s building blocks (e.g., cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin, and proteins) and the biorefinery concept encompasses the whole processing of biomass, considering upstream, midstream, and downstream processing (CHERUBINI, 2010; PARADA et al., 2017) . The main challenge is the feasible production of biofuels and biochemicals in a cost effective, ef ficient, and sustainable way (CHERUBINI, 2010) . Although using renewable feedstock, biorefinery sustainability should also consider others aspects, such as land use for bio mass production, soil, and air quality during processing, and environ mental and economic impacts (PARAJULI et al., 2015) .", "Considering biochemical conversion processes, microbial cells are a central aspect of biomass conversion, functioning as biocatalysts that convert liquid, solid, or gaseous substrates into alcohols, acids, enzymes, and other products through a series of metabolic reactions. In particular, Clostridium species have been invo lved in many important fermentative processes, such as the production of butanol, acetone, ethanol, acetic acid, lactic acid, succinic acid, 1,3 -propanediol, and more (DANIELL; KÖPKE; SIMPSON, 2012; KÖPKE et al., 2010; LIOU et al., 2005; SCHIEL -BENGELSDORF; DÜRRE, 2012) . Therefore, the current study reviews fundamental aspects of important Clostridium species and their biochemical pathways to highlight ma jor theoretical concepts that are present in many processes currently discussed in literature. This work also highlights important biomolecules and feedstocks that have a great potential in the biorefinery concept and would play an important role towards a more sustainable bioeconomy.", "2 Clostridium sp.", "Prazmowski proposed the genus Clostridium through the type species Clostridium butyricum in 1880. This genus then became the general category for anaerobic, spore forming and Gram -positive microorganisms. There are about 228 species and subspecies currently known, some of which highly heterogeneous, that present several phenotypes (LAWSON; RAINEY, 2016) . Among the species of the genus there are those that synthesize quinones and cytochromes, acidophiles, thermophiles, and psychrophiles (VOS et al., 2011) . According to Lawson and Rainey there are phylogenetic and phenotypic incoherencies in the genus Clostridium . The", "Chapter 2 researchers defend the restriction of the genus Clostridium to Clostridium cluster I a s Clostridium sensu stricto (LAWSON; RAINEY, 2016) .", "2.1 General Aspects", "Generally, bacteria of the Clostridium genus are rod -shaped wit h Gram -positive staining. Single cell diameters may vary from 0.3 to 2.0 μm and lengths from 1.5 to 20 μm; they are usually arranged in pairs or in short chains with rounded or pointed ends. With the presence or absence of flagella, a single cell may be mo tile, usually with peritrichous flagella, or immotile. They do not reduce sulfates and are, g enerally, catalase negative (LAWSON; RAINEY, 2016) . Most species have sporulation capacity, which can be directly affected by presence of oxygen, because they are anaerobic. However, species of Clostridium genus have different oxygen toler ance capacities (VOS et al., 2011) . Most species are chemotrophic; some are chemoautotrophic or chemolithotrophic. They may be saccharolytic, proteolytic, none , or both. Metabolically they are very diverse, with optimum temperature between 10 and 65 °C. They are distributed in the environment. Many species produce potent exotoxins, and some species are pathogenic to animals, both by infection of wounds and by ab sorption of toxins (GOMES, 2013) .", "When exposed to nutrient -depleting conditions, alternative metabolic pathways of clostridia are activated. Sporulation starts at the beginning of the stationary phase as an adaptation response and can affect end products related to energy metabolism, since it involves several metabolic pathways associated to biochemical, morphological, and physiological changes. Although the lack of nutrients commonly triggers sporulation, a source of energy is still needed to fuel macromolecular synthesis.

It has motility and a rare sporulation mechanism. The optim um temperature for growth is 38 °C. This species presents autotrophic growth when in the presence of carbon dioxide (CO 2) and CO, but is also able to grow with several organic sources, such as fructose, galactose, glucose, and mannose (BENGELSDORF; STRAUB; DÜRRE, 2013) . It produces acetic acid, ethanol, butyrate, and butanol as the final products (BENGELSDORF; STRAUB; DÜRRE, 2013; LIOU et al., 2005) . From syngas (mixture of mainly CO, CO 2 and H 2), almost 24 g/L of ethanol production have been reported (SHEN; BROWN; WEN, 2014a) (Table 1). The surface of C. carboxidivorans cells are hydrophilic but also capable of being attracted by hydrophobic molecules, liquids, and surfaces, and capable of interacting with them when immersed in water (COELHO et al., 2016) .", "In the genomic analysis of C. carboxidivorans , to understand biofuel production pathways genetic determinants were observed for CO use and production of acetate, ethanol, and butanol. One example is the presence of a gene encoding a dehydrogenase characteristic of the ABE (acetone -butanol -ethanol) fe rmentation, previously described for C. acetobutylicum and C. beijerincki , responsible for converting acetyl -CoA to acetaldehyde and ethanol, and acetyl -CoA to butyryl -CoA and butanol via butyraldehyde. However, genes present in other Clostridium strains that encode proteins for acetone production were not found in C. carboxidivorans (BRUANT et al., 2010) .", "2.3 Fermentation and Biochemical pathways", "Organic acids and alcohols can be obtained by anaerobic fermentation performed by Clostr idium from organic or inorganic carbon sources. The fermentation processes of the different species are divided into three main fermentations: ABE (acetone -butanol -ethanol), IBE (isopropanol -butanol -ethanol) and HBE (hexanol - butanol -ethanol). The latter wa s recently proposed by a research group that has been", "Chapter 2 studying the C. carboxidivorans P7 strain (FERNÁNDEZ -NAVEIRA et al., 2017; FERNÁNDEZ -NAVEIRA; VEIGA; KENNES, 2017b) .", "Independently of the end products, each strain can use different metabolic pathways based on the available carbon source and its genetic information. D ifferent carbohydrates, for example, are fermented through different pathways by Clostridia. In the case of hexoses, thei r metabolism follows the Embden -Meyerhof -Parnas (EMP) pathway, whereas the metabolism of pentoses takes place through the pentose phosp hate (PP) pathway (FERNÁNDEZ -NAVEIRA; VEIGA; KENNES, 2017b) . On the other hand, to assimilate CO, CO 2, and H 2 for HBE fermentation, C. carboxidivorans uses the Wood -Ljungdahl pathway (FERNÁNDEZ -NAVEIRA et al., 2017; FERNÁNDEZ -NAVEIRA; VEIGA; KENNES, 2017b) . These fermentation processes and biochemical pathways will be discussed in this section. Hexanol -Butanol -Ethanol (HBE) Fermentation C. carboxidivorans produces hexanol and hexanoic acid from synthesis gas (mainly CO, H 2, and CO 2) (BENGELSDORF; DÜRRE, 2017) . As this bacterium also produces butanol and ethanol, the term HBE (hexanol -butanol -ethanol) fermentation was introduced by Fe rnandez -Navei ra et al. (2017) . HBE fermentation is a term derived from ABE fermentation and known for solventogenic bacteria (BENGELSDORF; DÜRRE, 2017) , as alre ady mentioned.", "C. carboxidivorans is able to start the solventogenic phase without a drastic pH reduction, which is the case of ABE fermentation. Thus, buffering the culture medium for HBE fermentation by C. carboxidivorans may induce higher acid productio n and promote greater conversion in the solventogenic phase. However, further investigation and applications of genetic engineering are necessary to reduce the inhibitory effect of high concentrations of solvents and acids produced (FERNÁNDEZ -NAVEIRA; VEIGA; KENNES, 2017b) .", "Embden -–Meyerhof -–Parnas (EMP) pathway and Pentose phosphate (PP) pathway EMP and PP pathways for Clostridium species to metabolize hexoses and pentoses, respectively, have been shown by several authors (FERNÁNDEZ - NAVEIRA; VEIGA; KENNES, 2017b; RAGANATI et al., 2015; SHINTO et al., 2008) .", "Chapter 2 Agro -industrial wastes, commonly used as feedstocks for biofuel production , generate mainly glucose, arabinose, mannose, xylose, fructose, sucrose, and lactose as substrates after a pre -treatment process (FERNÁNDEZ -NAVEIRA; VEI GA; KENNES, The nature of the sugars is a key parameter that will affect the efficiency of the fermentation process and the production of metabolites (FERNÁNDEZ -NAVEIRA; VEIGA; KENNES, 2017b) . Monosaccharides are transported by a faster system than disaccharides. In the case of glucose and fructose, EMP is directly used. For galactose, for example, after being phosphorylated, galactose ‐6‐P is metabolized via the tagatose 6 ‐P pathway and subsequently enters the glycolytic pathway. These differences result in different consumption rates between sucrose and lactose (FERNÁNDEZ -NAVEIRA; VEIGA; KENNES, 2017b; SHINTO et al., 2008) . In the case of pentoses, which are usually mixed with hexoses, there is the carbon catabolic repression ( CCR) issue, which suppresses pentose consumption because of the preferable use of glucose (FAST et al., 2015b; NOGUCHI et al., 2013) . Wood -Ljungdahl pathway The Wood -Ljungdahl (WL) pathway provides acetate from inorganic sources, such as H 2, CO, and CO 2. Acetogenic bacteria follow the WL pathway to produce biofuels from CO, CO 2, and H 2, or syngas/waste gas (FERNÁNDEZ -NAVEIRA; VEIGA; KENNES, 2017b) .", "The WL pathway comprises two branches: methyl and carbonyl branches both contribute to acetyl -CoA formation and s tart with the assimilation of CO or CO 2 (ABUBACKAR; VEIGA; KENNES, 2015) . In the methyl b ranch, formate is obtained through the reduction of CO 2. In the carbonyl branch, CO or CO 2 can be taken directly and converted into acetyl -CoA (FERNÁNDEZ -NAVEIRA; VEIGA; KENNES, 2017b) . Growth of acetogenic bacteria is possible because of the formation of acetate from 2 mols of CO 2, with H 2 as a reducing agent and, therefore, this pathway must be coupled with ATP formation. This is believed to be the ol dest biochemical pathway, responsible for producing biomass and ATP in the ancient world (FERNÁNDEZ -NAVEIRA et al., 2017) . In the first step of the methyl group, the possibility of CO assimilation followed by the action of CO desidrogenase generates two protons and two electrons that can be used as inputs t o format desidrogenase action on the following reaction. In other", "Chapter 2 words, the WL pathway is capable of sustaining the autotrophic growth of the microorganism only with CO, even without H 2 for electron donation (SUN et al., 2018; TSVETANOVA; PETROVA; PETROV, 2018b) . In heterotrophic conditions, alcohols, organic acids, and simple sugars are able to donate electrons to the WL pathway (LI In the Wood -Ljungdahl pathway, acetyl -CoA is a common intermediate of both branches. The acetyl -CoA formed by the WL pathway can be used for direct biomass formation or to undergo action of the phosphotransacetylase (PTA) followed by the acetate kinase (ACK), generating 1 ATP and forming 1 acetat e. Alternatively, acetyl - CoA can also be converted to acetald ehyde, then to ethanol or butyry l-CoA and, subsequently, into butyrate and/or butanol, or into hexanoyl -CoA and then hexanoate and/or hexanol (FERNÁNDEZ -NAVEIRA; VEIGA; KENNES, 2017b) .", "Oxygen inhibits various enzymes from the WL pathway and its presence may increase the redox potential. Therefore, it is considered one of the most toxic gases during the syngas fermentation (LI et al., 201 6a). However, some acetogenic microorganisms are tolerant of O 2 concentrations ranging from 0.5% to 6% of saturation (CARDOSO et al., 2018) .", "3 FEEDSTOCK FOR ANAEROBIC PROCESSES", "3.1 Syngas", "Synthesis gas or syngas is a gaseous mixture mainly composed of CO, H 2, and CO 2 that can present smaller quantities of methane (CH 4), hydrogen sulfide (H 2S), and nitrogen (N 2) depending on the biomass compositi on and conversion conditions (SHEN et al., 2015) . Different biomass sources, such as municipal solid waste, animal slurry, agricultural residue, energy crops, and coal can be used to produce syngas by pyrolysis or gasification (SHEN et al., 2015) . Fast pyrolysis of biomass occurs in an oxygen -free environment with moderate temperatures, resulting in syngas, biochar, and bio -oil, an energy rich liquid composed of carboxylic acids, sugars, alcohols, aldehydes, esters, ketone s, aromatics, and furans (HUBER; IBORRA; CORMA, 2006; SHEN et al., 2015) . Bio-oil and synthesis gas composition depends on the pyrolysis technology implemented and biomass composition (SHEN et al., 2015) . Reactors used in fast pyrolysis, commonly flui dized bed reactors, must have a controlled temperature,", "Chapter 2 high heat transfer rates, a nd rapid cooling of vapors (HUBER; IBORRA; CORMA, Biomass can be also converted to synthesis gas through gasification, which is conducted at higher temperature s than pyrolysis (800 -1000 °C), promoted by heat and/or electricity, and in the presence of a gasifying agent (HUBER; IBORRA; CORMA, 2006; SHEN et al., 2015; WOOLCOCK; BROWN, 2013) . Synthesis gas is the main product of this thermochemical process, and biomass composition has an important impact on gas proportion and content, which can have trace amounts of sulfur (H 2S), hydrogen chlorine (HCl), alkali metals (potassium and sodium), tars, and ammonia (NH 3) (SHEN et al., 2015; WOOLCOCK; BROWN, 2013) . These contaminants can interfere in the microbial co nversion of synthesis gas and therefore purification technologies should be implemented, such as wet scrubbing or hot/cold/warm gas clean up (WOOLCOCK; BROWN, 2013) . Biomass properties (ash, moisture, particle size), gasifying agent (air, steam, pure O 2), reactor type (updraft gasifier, downdraft gasifier, fluid -bed gasifier) and operational conditions (temperature, fuel:gasifying agent ratio) also influence the synthesis gas composition (MOHAMMADI et al., 2011; WOOLCOCK; BROWN, 2013) .", "Synthesis gas conversion can produce important chemicals and fuels through the Fisher –Tropsch (chemical) process or fermen tation (biochemical process) (SHEN et al., 2015) . The Fischer –Trops ch process involves catalyzation by iron, cobalt, or ruthenium, producing alcohols and liquid hydrocarbons at 200 -350 °C, a fixed H2:CO:CO 2 ratio, and a limited amount of impurities (DRY, 2002) . The chemical conversion process has several drawbacks due to its catalytic and operational nature, including low catalyst specificity, high energetic demand, sensitivity to toxic gases and high pressure, and temperature conditions (PHILLIPS; CLAUSEN; GADDY, 1994; VEGA ; CLAUSEN; GADDY, 1990; WORDEN et al., 1991) . The fermentation of synthesis gas obtained by the pyrolysis/gasification of biomass is considered a hybrid route since it is a combination of two conversion processes: thermochemical and biochemical [144]. M icrobial conversion of syngas occurs at a determined temperature and pH, and can be performed by different acetogenic microorganisms ( C. ljungdahlii, C. autoethanogenum, Acetobacterium woodii, C. carboxidivorans P7, C. ragsdalei P11, Archaeoglobus fulgidus , etc.) and hydrogenic microorganisms ( Rhodospirillum rubum, Desulfotomaculum carboxydivorans, Themococcus onnurineus NA1, etc.)", "Chapter 2 producing acetate, butyrate, ethanol, 2,3 -butanediol, lactate, and others (KÖPKE et al., 2010; LIOU et al., 2005; MOHAMMADI et al., 2 011; SHEN et al., 2015; YASIN et Synthesis gas fermentation has many advantages when compared to well - established processes in the chemical industry. Considering the Fischer –Tropsch process, syngas fermentation presents a higher tolerance t o sulfur compounds; a variety of CO, H 2, and CO 2 ratios in synthesis gas that can be used as a substrate and not a fixed ratio; lower operational pressure and temperature, which decreases operational costs; and high prod uctivity and product uniformity (LATIF et al., 2014) . Regarding other biotechnological conversions of lignocellulosic biomass, synthesis gas fermentation eliminates a complex pre -treatment stage, which would enhance operational cost due to enzyme acquisition (SHEN et al., 2015) . All components of lignoc ellulosic biomass are converted (MUNASINGHE; KHANAL, 2012) . However, one of the major bottlenecks in this process, especially concerning commercialization, is the mass transfer between gas and liquid phases due to the low solubility of synt hesis ga s (BREDWELL; SRIVASTAVA; WORDEN, 1999; BREDWELL; WORDEN, 1998; WORDEN; BREDWELL, 1998) . The increase of gas solubility in culture media may enhance the availability of gaseous substrate to cells, improving both the cell’s autotrophic gro wth and product conversion (BREDWELL; WORDEN, 1998) . For micro -organisms to conv ert the gaseous substrate into fuels and chemicals, it is important that the nutrient is internalized by the cell, which occurs in a certain pathway from the interior of the gas bu bble to the cell cytoplasm . Although mass transfer can present many resistan ces during this pathway, most may be neglected in most bioreactors except for the resistance near the gas –liquid interface, which is a function of gas diffusivity in the liquid phase, as well as the film thickness (KADIC, E.; HEI NDEL, 2017) . The gas adsorption in the liquid phase is a limiting step for gas –liquid mass transfer and is accounted for in the overall volumetric mass transfer, k La, which is increased when the gas mass transfer to the liquid phase increases (KADIC, E.; HEINDEL, 2017) . Consequently, produc tivity would increase in gas-liquid systems.", "Many approaches have been proposed in literature in order t o increase mass transfer in gas -liquid systems, such as gas specificity, increasing operational pressure, increasing gas and liquid flow rates, larger specific gas –liquid interfacial areas,", "Chapter 2 different reactor configurations, different liquid phases, innovative impeller designs, mathematic al approaches, and more (COELHO et al., 2019; KUMARESAN; NERE; JOSHI, 2006; MUNASINGHE; KHANAL, 2012, 2014; ORGILL et al., 2019; UNGERMAN; HEINDEL, 2007; YASIN et al., 2014) . Table 3 summarizes some approaches reported in literature so far. Recently, the use of perfluorodecalin (PFC) and Tween® 80 improved carbon monoxide mass transfer to a liquid phase composed of distilled water, PFC, and Tween® 80 in a stirred tank reactor with a sparger and Rushton -type and Smith -type impellers (COELHO et al., 2019) .", "Synthesis gas obtained from residues is a cheap feedstock that can be used to produce sustaina ble biofuels and chemicals (MOHAMMADI et al., 2011) . An ethanol productivity of 7.3 g/L.day was achieved in 5 L bioreactors during a two -stage continuous fermentation of synthesis gas using C. ljungdahlii (RICHTER; MARTIN; ANGENENT, 2013) .

Global ethanol production has grown considerably over the past decade. In 2017, its global production was approximately 98 billion liters (IEA, 2019) . Ethanol is a very versatile building block for industry. It can be used to generate chemicals such as ethylene, propylene, 1,3 -butadiene, and hydrocarbons, as well as in the production of oxygenated molecules, such as acetaldehyde, butanol, acetic ac id, acetone, and dimethyl ether (CHENG; TIMILSINA, 2011; SUN; CHENG, 2002) .

The vast majority of ethanol is produced by a fermentation process, using renewable sources as feedstock and microbial catalysts. Two main types of crops are used in the ethanol production industry by a well -established technology: sugar rich crops, suc h as sugar cane, and amylaceous crops, such as corn. Synthetic ethanol processing is economically less attractive than fermentation due to the high production cost of ethylene and the great availability of agricultural products and byproducts (ROOZBEHANI et al., 2013) .", "Clostridium species can produce ethanol from several renewable sources, such as sugary or starchy materials (sugar cane, sugar beet, corn, etc.), lignocellulosic materials (e.g., cane bagasse and corn stover), as well as from gaseous substrates, such as CO, CO 2, and H2.

These configuration s are known as SHF (separate hydrolysis and fermentation), SSF (simultaneous saccharification and fermentation), SSCF (simultaneous saccharification and co -fermentation), and CBP (c onsolidated", "Chapter 2 bioprocessing) (DEVARAPALLI; ATIYEH, 2015) . In the SHF, the hydrolysis of the biomass and the hexose/pentose fermentations are carried out in separate reactors. The main advantage of this configuration is the possibility of performing each step in its optimal conditions of pH and temperature. However, high concentrations of glucose and/or cellobiose in the first step inhibit the cellulases and reduce their efficiencies. The SSF configuration occurs with cellulose hydrolysis and hexose fermentation in the same bioreactor, reducing the inhibition of cellulases by end products as observed in the SHF, but making it difficult to process both steps in their optimum conditions of pH and temperature. Furthermore, microorganisms used in the SSF are able to ferment only glucose, not being able to utilize xylose. The SSCF configuration is similar to the SSF, but glucose and xylose can be fermented in the same bioreactor, as some genetically engineered strains are developed to ferment both substrates (DEVARAPALLI; ATIYEH, 2015; MARGEOT et al., 2009) . CBP configuration is represented by one single microorganism that produces enzymes to hydrolyze cellulose and hemicellulose, and converts the resulting sugars into ethanol. Thus, the enzyme production, hydrolysis, and fermentation steps occur in the same biore actor, reducing costs and increasing process efficiency. However, this type of biocatalyst is still in the early development stage (LYND et al., 2003, 2005) . In 2014, a study reported the production of ethanol and butanol through SHF an d SSF processes with C. acetobutylicum NBRC13948.

C. phytofermentans was used in a CBP configuration with corn stover as feedstock. An ammonia fiber expansion (AFEX) pretreatment process was conducted and 7g/L of ethanol was produced after 264h of fermentation (JIN et Another way to transform the lignocellulosic biomass into ethanol is the hybrid technology that inv olves thermochemical and biochemical steps, known as syngas fermenta tion (KHANNA; GOYAL; MOHOLKAR, 2013) , as already mentioned in the feedstock section. In addition to the syngas produced from gasification of b iomass, industrial waste gas streams containing CO, H 2, and CO 2 can also be converted to ethanol by Clostridium species, in the biochemical step (DEVARAPALLI; ATIYEH, 2015) . The main advantage of the syngas fermentation process is that all components", "Chapter 2 of lignocellulosic mat erial, including lignin, are converted into syngas and later fermented, overcoming the recalcitrant characteristic of this biomass and eliminating the elevated costs related to the enzymatic pretreatment step (SHEN et al., 2015) . In 2014, it was reported that 24 g/L of ethanol was obtained from syngas fermentation (50% CO, 30% H 2, and 20% CO 2) by C. carboxidivorans P7 in a hollow fiber membrane biofilm reactor (HFM -BR)(SHEN; BROWN; WEN, 2014a) . Richter et al. (2013) reported a two -stage syngas fermentation process by C. ljunghdalli ERI -2, operating one bioreactor for cell growth and a bubble column bioreactor equipped with a cell recycle module for ethanol production. Syngas containing 60% CO, 3 5% H 2, and 5% CO 2 was used, and 18 g/L of ethanol was obtained, with a productivity of 0.37 g/L.h. A study carried out recently with C. carboxidivorans P7 reported an ethanol productivity of 0.28 g/L.h with a syngas composition of 20% CO, 5% H 2, 15% CO 2, and 60% N 2, in a horizontal rotating packed bed biofilm reactor (h -RPB). Seven grams per liter of ethanol were obtained using the h -RPB reactor, which was 3.3 times higher than that obtained in a CSTR (continuous stirred tank reactor) under the same conditi ons (SHEN; BROWN; WEN, 2017) .", "4.2 Butanol", "Butanol (butyl alcohol) is a four -carbon alcohol with the molecular formula C4H9OH. It is a volatile, biodegradable, low -toxicity, flammable, and colorless liquid at ambient temperature. There are four isomeric structures of butanol: n -butanol, sec - butanol , isobutanol, and tert -butanol. This alcohol is an important building block for the chemical industry, being used as an intermediate to the production of methacrylate esters, butyl acrylate, butyl glycol ether, butyl acetate, and plasticizers. It can also be used as a diluent for brake fluid formulation, and for the production of antibiotics, vitamins, and hormones (LEE et al., 2008; QURESHI; BLASCHEK, 2001) . One of the most important applications of butanol is as a direct replacement of gasoline or as a fuel additive, due to the low vapor pressure and corrosivity, which allows its transportation and storage in the same infrastructure existing for gasoline, as well as its blend with existing gasoline at much higher proportions than ethanol (JIN et al., 2011; LEE et al. , 2008) . Furthermore, as butanol is a four -carbon alcohol, it has the double carbon content of ethanol an d contains 25% more energy (LEE et al., 2008) .", "Chapter 2 These advantages make butanol outstrip ethanol as an alternative biofuel (ZHENG et Butanol has been traditionally produced by anaerobic ferme ntation of sugar -rich substrates using Clostridium sp. via ABE fermentation process. With the emergence of the petrochemical industry in the 1950s, most butanol in the world started to be produced from fossil oil, through the hydroformylation of propene, a process known as oxo synthesis (QURESHI; BLASCHEK, 2001) . In the 1970s, the global energy crisis rekindled the worldwide focus towards development of alternative fuels, reigniting intere st in ABE fermentation (NICOLAOU; GAIDA; PAPOUTSAKIS, 2010 ; QURESHI; BLASCHEK, 2001) . The fermentation technology of butanol production by Clostridium sp. has some drawbacks, such as the relatively high substrate cost arising from the use of edible biomass, the low final butanol concentration obtained (less th an 20 g/L), the low butanol selectivity, the low volumetric butanol productivity (less than 0.5 g/L.h), and the high cost of recovery. Thus, butanol fermentation is less competitive than that of other biofuels (ZHE NG et al., 2015) . Aiming at overcoming these disadvantages related to the fermentation technology, some studies reported the development of genetically engineered strains to improve butanol yield, different modes of operation to increase the productivit y, different recovery processes, and the use of non -edible feedstocks fo cusing on residual biomass (ZHENG et al., 2015) .", "Lignocellulosic biomass, syngas, molasses, and glycerol are promising feedstocks for ABE fermentation.

Using crude glycerol (50 g/L) as a substrate, butanol production of 8.95 g/L was reported in a batch fermentation with C. pasteurianum DSM 525, and 0.119 g/L.h of productivity was achieved (GALLARDO; ALVES; RODRIGUES, 2014) . A fibrous bed reactor with gas stripping recovery was use d to produce butanol with cassava bagasse hydrolysate by a hyper -butanol -producing C. acetobutylicum strain (JB200). More than 76 g/L of butanol was obtained with a productivity of 0.32 g/L.h (LU et al., 2012) . Only 1 g/L of buta nol and 3 g/L of ethanol were produced after 600 h in batch fermentation (70% CO, 20% H 2, 10% CO 2) using C. carboxidivorans P7 (PHILLIPS et al., 2015) .", "Chapter 2 Mutagenesis and metabolic engineering techniques have been used to develop new strains capable of produc ing butanol in adverse situations that the wild stra in could not.

A butanol concentration of 12.8 g/L was detected (LU et al., 2012) . Lee et al. (2016) reported the development of a metabolically engineered strain of C. acetobutylicum that produced 44.6 g/L of butanol. Glucose was used as the substrate in a continuous fermentative process, and in situ adsorptive recovery of butanol. A butanol productivity of 2.64 g/L.h was reported, which represents a high value compared to similar studies.", "Different fermentation techniques can be adopted in the ABE process, including: batch, fed -batch, semi -continuous, free cell continuous, immobilized cell continuous, cell recycle cell, biofilm reacto r, fed -batch extractive fermentation, and fed -back with in situ product recovery. The batch process is the most reported due to the low contamination risk and simple operation, but a maximum ABE solvent concentration of 25-30 g/L has been obtained (PHILLIPS et al., 2015) . Zhang et al. (2017) reported an immobilized cell fermentatio n system with co -culturing of C. beijerinkii and C. tyrobutyricum , using hydrolysate cassava bagasse as feedstock. More than 13 g/L of butanol was produced with a productivity of 0.44 g/L.h.", "Obstacles such as the low productivity, low yield, and low substr ate consumption are a result of solvent accumulation that causes severe inhibition. Efficient recovery processes are able to overcome these drawbacks, but usually lead to high processing cost and to large quantities of disposal water. The most -used recover y technique in the industry is conventional distillation, but other techniques have been investigated in order to reduce costs, enhance productivity, eliminate inhibition effects, and increase sugar consumption. Among these, liquid –liquid extraction, perva poration, gas stripping, perstraction, reverse osmosis, ionic liquid extraction, adsorption, and aqueous two -phase sep aration can be highlighted (MAITI et al., 2016) . A very recent study reported a two -stage fed -batch fermentation of glucose by C. acetobutylicum MTC11274 with magnesium limitation and calcium supplementation, integrated to a gas stripping system.

The results showed the PDMS composite membrane exhibited high and stable per formance for butanol recovery from ABE systems. Raganati et al. (2018) showed an efficient recovery of butanol from ABE fermentation broth by adsorption on Amberlite XAD -7, as this adsorbent presents high affinity for butanol and poor affinity for glucose.", "5 PARTIAL CONCLUSIONS", "First-generation biorefinery processes are based on the use of sugar -containing food crops as feedstock and lead to food –fuel competition. The use of lignocellulosic biomass, waste, or waste gases increases the sustainability of biorefineries, thereby overcoming the food –fuel dilemma. These two concepts can be integrated in a biorefinery, reducing the use of food crops, with the help of Clostridium species, as proposed in the hypothetical scenario presented in Fi gure 1. In the example, because sugarcane bagasse can be used to generate fuels and chemicals, reduced amounts of sugarcane juice are needed for this purpose. In this concept, the lignocellulosic biomass (sugarcane bagasse) can be submitted to pre -treatmen t for enzymatic hydrolysis for microbial transformation (biochemical route), and also be thermally converted to syngas for microbial fermentation (hybrid route). In both routes, significant progress has been made. Economic and market data can be used to ch oose between these processes, minimizing the disadvantages related to each one. Clostridium species are essential in this concept, since they can use syngas for solvent and fuel production, and can also use cellulosic material directly without the need of enzymatic hydrolysis. Further research and development are essential to improve yield and productivity, and to reduce the production costs of syngas fermentation. To achieve this, strategies of developing recombinant Clostridia to increase product toleranc e and the use of metabolic engineering to direct carbon flow to the production of target molecules must be adopted. In addition, the design of new bioreactor configurations to circumvent inherent problems of gas -liquid mass transfer, along with process optimization and downstream integration, will result in an efficient process with greater scalability potential.", "Chapter 2", "Figure 1.

To attain the levels of sustainability required to avoid further consequences of changes in the climate, alternatives for sustainable production not only of energy but also materials and chemicals must be pursued . In this respect, syngas fermentation has recently attracted much attention, particularly from industries responsible for high levels of greenhouse gas emissions. Syngas can be obtained by thermochemical conversion of biomass, animal waste, coal, municipa l solid wastes and other carbonaceous materials, and its composition depends on biomass properties and gasification conditions. It is defined as a gaseous mixture of CO and H 2 but, depending on those parameters, it can also contain CO 2, CH 4 and secondary c omponents, such as tar, oxygen and nitrogenous compounds. Even so, raw syngas can be used by anaerobic bacteria to produce biofuels (ethanol, butanol, etc.) and biochemicals (acetic acid, butyric acid, etc.). This review updates recent work on the influenc e of biomass properties and gasification parameters on syngas composition and details the influence of these secondary components and CO/H 2 molar ratio on microbial metabolism and product formation. Moreover, the main challenges, opportunities and current developments in syngas fermentation are highlighted in this review.", "Keywords: syngas fermentation; biomass composition; biomass gasification; hybrid processes ; thermo -biochemical conversion", "1 INTRODUCTION", "The increasing global demand for natural resources t ends to exceed our Earth’s capacity for their regeneration. As a result, environmental deterioration such as ocean acidification, greenhouse gas accumulation in the atmosphere and groundwater depletion, is accelerating (LIBERATO et al., 2019; WACKERNAGEL et al., 2021) . Faced with this scenario, alternative energy and materials sources are needed to meet growing demands as well as society’s environmental and economic concerns. Thus, sustainable goals set by several countries promote the use of bioenergy, biofuels and biochemicals (GUNES, 2021; LIBERATO et al., 2019) .", "Syngas fermentation fulfills the require ments for their sustainable production, having recently attracted much attention. It can be implemented directly in industries where the high levels of exhaust gases are constantly released, such as cement or steel manufacturing, oil refining and the produ ction of petrochemicals, contributing to the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions (GUNES, 2021; SUN et al., 2019b) .", "Chapter 3 Moreover, syngas can be obtained by thermochemical conversion, e.g., pyrolysis and gasification, of biomass, animal waste, coal, municipal solid waste and ot her carbonaceous materials (SUN et al., 2019b) .", "Syngas, also named synthesis gas, is mainly composed of CO (carbon monoxide), CO 2 (carbon dioxide) and H 2 (hydrogen gas) which c an be converted to alcohols such as ethanol, butanol and hexanol and other chemicals such as acetic, butyric and hexanoic acids by acetogenic bacteria through the Wood –Ljungdahl pathway or its derivatives (BENEVENUTI et al., 2020; SUN et al., 2019b) . Syngas fermentation is one of three major approaches to the production of second generation biofuels, along with the Fischer –Tropsch process and lignocellulosic fermentation (DANIELL; KÖPKE; SIMPSON, 2012) . The combination of gasificat ion with syngas fermentation results in taking advantage of some of the relevant features of thermochemical and biochemical technologies; however, the fermentation of these gaseous substrates presents challenges that still must be overcome. Syngas fermenta tion depends on factors such as the microorganism, type of reactor, gas composition, medium components, operating parameters, gas –liquid mass transfer and fermentation strategies (BENEVENUTI et al., 2020) .", "The present review provides an update of this work. Special attention is dedicated to syngas composition since its impact on a microorganism’s metabolism affects product distribution, titer, yield, productivity , and the feasibility of the processes involved.

The gasification of different carbon -containing feedstocks using different gasifying agents and a wide spectrum of catalysts allows it to achieve specific targeted syngas quality and yield, which makes this technology very flexible and versatile. Gasific ation temperature, operating pressure, gasifier configurations, residence time, superficial velocity and flow rate of the gasifying agent are other operational factors that influence the composition and yield of syngas, expanding the syngas composition pos sibilities. Moreover, it is considered a sustainable thermochemical conversion technology for the production of clean gaseous fuels since several renewable feedstocks such as biomass, solid wastes and/or by -products, such as glycerol, from biorefinery proc esses can be used (CHAN et al., 2021; KHUSHBOO e t al., 2020) .", "Gasification of Biomass Sludge, energy crops, crop residues, wood, algal biomass and tamarind shells, among others, can be converted into gaseous products by gasification (DAS et al., 2021; KHUSHBOO et al., 2020; MURUGAN; JOSEPH SEKHAR, 2021) . Compared to fossil sources, biomass contains less nitrogen, sulfur and heavy metals, and has higher H/C ratios, resulting in lower pol lutant emissions, higher reactivity and lower gasification temperatures (HE et al., 2021; RAM ACHANDRIYA et al., 2016) . The conversion of biomass to syngas usually occurs under oxygen -limited and fuel-rich conditions through four steps: drying, pyrolysis, combustion and reduction. Drying, the first step, involves the release of moisture from bio mass, which further reacts to produce hydrogen gas (water gas shift reactions). The biomass then undergoes thermal decomposition in the pyrolysis zone. Combustion, which is an exothermic reaction, is the next step wherein the devolatilized products (produc ed", "Chapter 3 during pyrolysis) react with an oxidizing agent, producing the heat essential for endothermic reactions.

Fixed bed gasifiers, usually used for slow conversion, operate at higher temperatures due to the non -uniform mixing of biomass, generating a high tar content of the producer gas. Fixed bed gasifiers involve an updraft or downdraft while fluidized bed configurations can include either circulating fluidized beds or bubbling beds. As a fluidized bed system works with the principle of a high velocity fluid flow, it is mainly used for fast conversion, operating at a homogeneous temperature. However, more of the particulate matter (char and ash) is generated by fluidized bed gasifiers as compared to fixed bed gasifiers (DAS et al., 2021; KHUSHBOO et al., 2020) . The major advantage of the fluidized bed gasifiers is the high heat transfer rates it can handle, besides its temperature control and ease of operation. Thus, this reactor can be scaled up for industrial applications or large -scale production, whereas a fi xed bed reactor is suitable for small scale production (DAS et al., 2021; KHUSHBOO et al., For each configuration and type of biomass, an optimum biomass flow rate is required for the gasification process in order to maximize energy efficiency. An overfeed of biomass reduces the conversion efficiency; however, biomass feeds below the optimum flow rate lead to lower gas yield. The flow rate of the gasifying agent is also important, especially when air or oxygen is used because it controls the degree of combustion and, hence, the reactor temperature. An increase in temperature promotes an increase in gas yield; however, it can also increase soot formation, especially in fixed bed gasifiers. Soot is an aerosol product formed by incomplete combustion, whi ch reduces the energy efficiency and can interrupt continuous operation by causing blockages of pipes, hot -gas filters and heat exchangers, as well as by poisoning catalysts (HE et al., 2021; KHUSHBOO et al., 2020) .", "According to Murugan and Seklar (2021) , the performance of a gasifier depends on the moisture content of the feedstock and its equivalence ratio, which is the ratio of actual air supplied to the stoichiometric air required for complete combustion of the biomass.

Most of them can grow using CO 2 and H 2, and a few of them use only CO or both substrates (BENGELSDORF; STRAUB; DÜRRE, 2013) .", "Clostridium carboxidivorans (SATHISH et al., 2019; WAN et al., 2017) , Clostridium aceticum (RIEGLER et al., 2019) , Acetobacterium woodii (BERTSCH; MÜLLER, 2015) , Blautia producta, Clostridium autoethanogenum (MARTIN et al., 2016) , Clostridium difficille, Clostridium ljungdahlii, Clostridium magnum, Eubacterium limosum, Moorella Thermoacetica, Clostridium scatologenes, Clostridium coskatii (LEE et al., 2019) and Butyribacterium methylotrophicum are examples of acetogenic carboxydotrophic microorganisms (DRAKE; GÖSSNER; DANIEL, 2008; DRAKE; KÜSEL; MATTHIES, 2013; FAST et al., 2015b) .", "3.2 Fermentation Pathways", "Carbon capture and storage/sequestration (CCS) technologies involve capturing CO 2, transporting it to a storage site and depositing it where it will not reach the atmosphere.

It is the most energetically effi cient pathway for CO 2 fixation, which explains the large volume of recent studies on acetogenic microorganisms (BENGELSDORF; STRAUB; DÜRRE, 2013; WONG, 2014) . Wood –Ljungdahl Pathway The Wood –Ljungd ahl pathway is also known as the reductive pentose phosphate pathway. Basically, in this pathway, CO 2 is reduced to carbon monoxide and formic acid or directly into a formyl group. The formyl group is reduced to a methyl group and then combined with the ca rbon monoxide and coenzyme A to produce acetyl -CoA, an important intermediate in biomass and biomolecule production (Figure", "Figure 1. Wood –Ljungdahl pathway for CO 2 and CO conversion into acetyl -CoA by acetogenic bacteria based on (FAST et al., 2015b; WOO; JANG, 2019) The Wood –Ljungdahl pathway consists of methyl and carbonyl branches, as represented in Figure 1. In the m ethyl branch, one molecule of CO 2 is reduced to formate catalyzed by formate dehydrogenase ( fdh). Subsequently, formate and tetrahydrofolate (THF) generate formyl -THF by the action of formyl -THF synthetase", "Chapter 3 (fhs) in an ATP -consuming reaction. The reduction of formyl -THF to methyl -THF is catalyzed by methenyl -THF cyclohydrolase ( mtc), methylene -THF dehydrogenase (mtd) and methylene -THF reductase ( mtr). In the next step of the methyl branch, the methyl group is transferred to a corrinoid iron –sulfur protein. I n the carbonyl branch, when CO is used as the only carbon source, one molecule of CO enters the carbonyl branch directly and another molecule of CO is oxidized to CO 2 by carbon monoxide dehydrogenase (CODH) with simultaneous formation of reduced ferredoxin . Finally, the enzyme complex carbon monoxide dehydrogenase/acetyl -CoA synthetase (CODH/ACS) forms the acetyl -CoA, coupling the methyl group, the carbonyl group and coenzyme A (BENEVENUTI et al., 2020; BENGELSDORF; STRAUB; DÜRRE, 2013) . The acetyl -CoA formed by the Wood –Ljungdahl pathway can be used for biomass production or to undergo the action of phosphotransacetylase ( pta) followed by acetate kinase ( ack), generating 1 mol of ATP and 1 mol of acetate. Alternatively, acetyl -CoA can also be converted to acetaldehyde, then to ethanol; to butyryl -CoA and, subsequently, into butyrate and/or butanol; into hexanoyl -CoA and then hexanoate and/or hexanol, depending on the microorganisms used (FERNÁNDEZ - NAVEIRA; VEIGA; KENNES, 2017b) .", "One important singularity of acetogenic microorganisms is the synergy between heterotrophic and autotrophic metabolisms, called mixotrophs. The CO 2 that results from sugar metabolization is reduced in a Wood –Ljungdahl pathway, us ing the reducing power from glycolysis to produce additional acetyl -CoA molecules. This results in the full fixation of carbon from sugar sources in a mixotrophic scenario (FAST et al., 2015b) .

Two aspects of its composition are particularly important for successfully integrating thermochemical and biochemical technologies, syngas impurities and H 2/CO ratios (LIAKAKOU et al., 2021; RAMACHANDRIYA et al., 2016) .", "Syngas Impurities Besides the major components (CO, H 2 and CO 2), biomass -derived syngas may contain additional constituents such as ethylene (C 2H4), ethane (C 2H6), acetylene (C2H2), tar, ash, char particles, oxygen (O 2), ammonia (NH 3), nitric oxide (NO), hydrogen sulfide (H 2S), sulfur dioxide (SO 2) and hydrogen cyanide (HCN) (HARYANTO et al., 2009; KUMAR; JONES; HANNA, 2009; XU; TREE; LEWIS, 2011) . Tars can be composed of several high -molecular weight molecules that are gas chromatography undetectable, such as 7 carbon and higher ring compounds, heterocycles such as phenol, cresol and pyridine, light aromatic such as toluene, styrene and xylene, light poly -aromatic such as naphthalene, phenanthrene and anthracene, and heavy poly -aromatic su ch as fluoranthene, pyrene, chrysene, perylene and benzoperylene; however, usually these components are not evaluated individually . The composition in terms of these impurities in syngas varies with feedstock type, gasifying agent and operating conditions (MUNASINGHE; KHANAL, 2011) , but the most frequently found compounds are tar, ammonia (NH 3), nitric oxide (NO) and hydrog en cyanide (HCN) (KUMAR; JONES; HANNA, 2009) . Some of these impurities can inhibit acetogenic bacterial activity, even at very low concentrations, by limiting cell growth, enzyme activities or by changing physiochemical conditions (pH, osmolarity, redox potential, etc.) (SUN et al., 2019b) .

On the other hand, Xu e Lewis (2012) showed that NH 3 is rapidly converted to ammonium ion (NH 4+) in the fermentation media and the accumulated NH 4+ inhibits hydrogenase activity and cell growth of acetogenic bacteria. It seems that there is a microbial tolerance for these substances (RAMACHANDRIYA et al., 2016) . For example, C. ragsdalei was able to withstand 5% of oxygen (SUN et Xu, Tree e Lewis (2011) reported that entrained tar particulates larger than 0.025 mm, nitric oxide larger than 0.004 mo l% and ammonia in general have an adverse effect on the fermentation process.

For example, direct gasification of biomass using a fluidized bed gasifier provides a ratio of H 2 to CO between 0.25 and 0.53. Three gasification technologies (fixed bed updraft gasification with 30 kg/h solid feed, bubbling fluidized bed gasification with 0.3 kg/h solid feed and indirect gasification with 3 kg/h solid feed) resulted in qui te different molar H 2/CO r atios ranging from 0.6 to 1.0 (LIAKAKOU et al., 2021) . One of the advantages of syngas fermentation over chemical conversions to liquid fuels is the flexibility of feedstock and syngas composition because microorganisms do not require precise H 2/CO ratios (RAMACHANDRIYA et al., 2016 ). Even with this flexibility identified for acetogens involved in syngas fermentation, a low ratio of H 2 to CO is preferred as most of the organisms grow better on CO than H2 (LIAKAKOU et al., 2021) . Lanzillo et al. (2020) showed that partial pressure of CO affected the growth kinetics of the microorganism and the optimal P CO within the studied range (0.5 to 2.5 atm) was 1.1 atm. Hurst and Lewis (2010) demonstrated that increasing the partial pressure of CO from 0.35 to 2.0 atm, increased cell growth and the reduction of acetic acid into ethanol, and suggested that this is related to the potential importance of CO partial pressure and CO to CO 2 partial pressure ratio to electron and ATP production. However, increasing the concentration of H 2 in the gas phase can increase the contribution of CO to ethanol production because significant amounts of carbon from CO can be converted to cell material and ethanol if H 2 is utilized as an electron source. The depletion of H 2 in the fermentation medium would reduce the amount of carbon available for ethanol production because a fraction of CO would be utilized for generating the required reducing equivalents (AHMED; LEWIS, 2007; MADDIPATI et al., 2011) . Valgepea et al. (2018) proved that at the molecular level with quantitative proteome analysis, H 2 supply strongly impacts carbon distribution with a 4-fold reduction in substrate loss and a proportional increase in flux to ethanol. Through metabolic modelling, they also showed that H 2 availability provided reducing power via H 2 oxidation and saved redox as cells reduced all the CO 2 to formate directly using H 2 in the Wood –Ljungdahl pathway.", "Both CO and H 2 were utilized by Clostridium ragsdalei , also known as Clostridium strain P11, for growth, acetic acid and ethanol production, being 4.3 moles", "Chapter 4 of CO and 0.45 moles of H 2 (MADDIPATI et al., 2011) . Ramachandriya et al. (2011) reported that Clostridium strain P11 showed different CO 2 and H 2 consumption profiles compared to Clostridium carboxidivorans P7, or P7, although their CO profiles were similar. Hydrogen consumption by P11 was approximately 300% higher than P7. The authors considered the hypothesis that the low H 2 consumption by P7 could be related to a higher conversion of acetic acid into ethanol by this strain. The reduction of acetic acid into ethanol could be supported by the H+ gradient that replenishes the reducing equivalent pool, NAD(P)+ to NAD(P)H (RAMACHANDRIYA et al., 2011) .", "Jack et al. (2019) evaluated syngas fermentation by Clostridium ljungdahlii on varying H 2/CO ratios and detected that the formation of acetate was favored by higher concentrations of hydrogen in the headspace.

The same process conditions of indirect gasificati on of lignin and beech wood resulted in H 2/CO ratios of 0.80 and 1.27, respectively, but similar acetate and ethanol productivities were obtained by Clostridium ljungdahlii DSM 13528 (acetate and ethanol: 0.16 and 0.02 g/L/h for lignin syngas and 0.17 and 0.01 g/L/h for beech wood syngas) (LIAKAKOU et al., 2021) .", "Diender, Stams and Sousa (2016) reported the use of a synthetic co -culture of Clostridium autoethanogenum and Clostridium kluyveri to convert syngas to a mixture of C4 and C6 fatty acids and their respective alcohols.

The main challenges include the carbon conversion efficiency of both steps, effects of gaseous impurities and the effect of H 2-CO-CO 2 ratios on syngas fermentation. The overall carbon conversion efficiency can be calculated based on the carbon present in the feedstock that can be converted into organic fermentation products.", "Chapter 4 Increasing the gasifier temperature conver ts tars into CO, CO 2 and H 2, thereby increasing the overall carbon conversion efficiency since these are fermentable gaseous species. The carbon conversion efficiency can also be controlled by the equivalence ratio. Higher equivalence ratios result in high er operating temperatures, which usually increase the degree of carbon oxidation and, thus, increase the carbon conversion efficiency of biomass gasification. However, the operating costs also increase as temperature increases. Moreover, higher equivalence ratios also result in more CO 2, while the optimum equivalence ratio results in more CO and H 2, which is more suitable for syngas fermentation, increasing the carbon conversion efficiency of syngas fermentation (RAMACHANDRIYA et al., 2016) .", "During syn gas fermentation, CO and H 2 are the electron donors required for several reduction reactions of the metabolic pathway. Carbon monoxide seems to be thermodynamically the preferred source of electrons at any given pH, ionic strength, gas partial pressure and electron pair carrier (HU; BOWEN; LEWIS, 2011) . However, the generation of reducing power from CO is undesirable because, besid es an inefficient use of CO as an electron source (that could potentially be carried out by hydrogenase enzymes using H 2), it also diverts the carbon flux of CO towards CO 2 and away from ethanol or other products. Consequently, the carbon conversion effici ency decreases (RAMACHANDRIYA et al., 2016) .", "A convenient strategy could involve an increase in H 2 concentration in the gas phase which could promote its use as an electron source, increasing the availability of CO to produce cell material, ethanol , and other products. As previously mentioned, if the H 2 concentration in the gas phase decreases, CO would be utilized to generate the required reducing equivalents, decreasing the amount of carbon available for the formation of organic products (AHMED; LEWIS, 2007; MADDIPATI et al., 2011) . On the other hand, lower concentrations of H2 in the headspace can favor acetate production over ethanol (DIENDER; STAMS; SOUSA, 2016) . In a low elect ron availability system, reducing equivalents can be provided by converting ethanol into acetate (RAMACHANDRIYA et al., 2011) .", "In short, even if microorganisms do not require rigorous H 2/CO ratios, this is an important parameter in order t o obtain the desired products and high carbon conversion efficiencies.

High-lignin biomass gasification tends to produce more H 2 (KOBAYASHI et al., 2011; LIAKAKOU et al., 2021) compared to biomass with a low lignin content (MURUGAN; JOSEPH SEKHAR, 2021; ZHANG et al., 2013) .

Alternative energy sources from renewable resources are needed mainly due to ever -higher amounts of greenhouse gases emissions and oil price fluctuation (RAMIÓ -PUJOL et al., 2015b) . In this context, biofuels, especially ethanol and butanol, represent potential substitutes of fossil fuels, such as gasoline. Currently, those alcohols are produced through fermentation processes, mostly using sugarcane and corn as raw material. The major disadvantage of these processes is the competi tion between food and fuel production (MUNASINGHE; KHANAL, 2011) . Lignocellulosic feedstocks from agricultural waste or directly from energy crops emerge as alternative raw materials for biofuel production once they are inexpensive, renewable and do not affect food supply (SUN; CHENG, 2002; YANG et al., 2014) .", "The biochemical conversion of lignocellu losic feedstocks into biofuels by anaerobic bacteria, such as Clostridium species, produces mainly acetone, butanol and ethanol (ABE), through ABE fermentation (FERNÁNDEZ -NAVEIRA; VEIGA; KENNES, 2017a) . However, a complex pre -treatment is required to obtain simple sugars from the polymeric structure of lignocellulose (LI et al., 2018) . An alternative destination for lignocellulosic feedstocks involves biomass gasification, which eliminates the pre -treatment step. Additionally, full use of lignocellulosic biomass,", "Chapter 4 including lignin, is possible t hrough thermochemical conversion. The biomass gasification results in synthesis gas mainly composed of CO (carbon monoxide), CO 2 (carbon dioxide) and H 2 (hydrogen). Synthesis gas, also named syngas, obtained from gasification, can be converted into ethanol and higher alcohols as butanol and hexanol, through a hybrid thermo/biochemical process. This conversion can be performed by Clostridum sp., being Clostridium ljungdahlii , C. carboxidivorans, C. autoethanogenum and C. rasgdalei the most studied species. T hese species use the acetyl -CoA metabolic pathway, also known as Wood -Ljungdahl pathway, for acetyl -CoA synthesis, energy conservation, and alcohol and acids production (LJUNGDAHL, 1986) . A current problem of anaerobic bioprocesses is low cell density, which reduces productivity (COELHO et al., 2016) . Usually, media composition used in CO/CO 2 fermentation is similar to sugar -based media for Clostridium sp. growth and butanol production. Numerous and expensive components are mixed to provide essential metals, vitamins, minerals, and nitrogen needed for cell growth and metabolism (WILKINS; ATIYEH, 2011) . As consequence, the preparation of those media requires intensive labor and is expensive. Replacing these compounds by cheaper and complex sources is an important challenge. ATCC® medium 2713 (Wilkins Chalgren Anaerobic Medium) is indicated by American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) for Clostridium carboxidivorans activation and growth and ATCC® medium 1754 (without fructose) is another common medium used for syngas fermentation by Clostridium carboxidivorans , reported by several authors (CHENG et al., 2019; LIOU et al., 2005; RAJAGOPALAN; P. DATAR; LEWIS, 2002; ZHANG et al., 2017; ZHANG; TAYLOR; WANG, 2016) . Low specific growth rates, ranging from 0.005 to 0.08 h−1 were reported for those media with gaseous or soluble substrates (FERNÁNDEZ -NAVEIRA; VEIGA; KENNES, 2017a; PHILLIPS et al., 2015; RAMIÓ -PUJOL et al., 2015a) . Studies using glucose -rich medium or only carbon monoxide as the carbon source have been carried out to evaluate the effect of the carbon source on cell growth and solvents production (DOLL et al., 2018; FERNÁNDEZ -NAVEIRA et al., 2016b; FERNÁNDEZ -NAVEIRA; VEIGA; KENNES, 2017a; JANG et al., 2012; MUNASINGHE; KHANAL, 2014; PH ILLIPS et al., 2015; RAMIÓ -PUJOL et al., 2015a) and the maximum values for cell density and specific growth rate were 0.55 g dry weight of cells/L and 0.231 h −1, respectively. In addition, the effects of trace metals on product formation were assessed (AHLAWAT et al., 2018; MOHAMMADI et al., 2011;", "Chapter 4 RAMIÓ -PUJOL et al., 2015b; SAXENA; TANNER, 2011; SHEN et al., 2017; WAN et al., 2017) and the maximum ethanol production reported was 3.5 g/L after 72 h of fermentation (SHEN et al., 2017) .", "Therefore, the goal of this work was to obtain a low-cost culture medium, reduced also in number of components, by a sequence of experimental designs in order to improve cell growth and solvents production by Clostridium carboxidivorans using glucose and syngas as carbon sources.", "2 MATERIAL AND METHODS", "2.1 Microorganism and culture medium", "Clostridium carboxidivorans DSM15243 was obtained from Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen GmbH (Braunschweig, Germany).

Zhang et al. (2016) reported that trace metals are required for C. carboxidivorans growth and these elements might be present in yeast extract. Peptone and tryptone are both sources of amino acids. However, as they are obtained from different protein sources (peptone is pancreatic digested gelatin and tryptone is the pancreatic digested casein), they might have complementary functions for cell growth. Another important observation is that glucose was not significant for cell growth, which might be related to the presence of CO and CO 2, indicating that syngas was used as the carbon source. Although the best result was obtained for the composition of the ATCC® medium 2713 (Table 2, run 16), the statistical evaluation shows that some components a re not significant to cell growth, which means that its addition to medium composition just adds costs.", "Considering the positive effect of these components on cell growth, the experimental design to optimize this medium was planned with higher concentrations. In that case, peptone was not significant to cell growth, which shows that it was only significant in PB design because tryptone concentration was not enough. The medium proposed for C. carboxidivorans cell growth after optimization, is reduced to three components, besides syngas. ATCC® medium 2713 is composed of nine components and many other media reported in literature have more than that, for example BDM - base defined medium (22 components) and P7 Mt medium (20 compon ents) (PHILLIPS et", "Chapter 4 · al., 2015) . In those laborious media, cell growth for C. carboxidivorans ranges from 0.4 to 0.6 g/L (FERNÁNDEZ -NAVEIRA et al., 2016b; FERNÁNDEZ -NAVEIRA; VEIGA; KENNES, 2017a; PHILLIPS et al., 2015) . Therefore, it is evident that the medium proposed in the present work not only has the advantage of being easy to prepare but also yields a higher biomass.", "For ethanol, experimental design revealed that a culture medium composed of 12 g/L of tryptone, 12 g/L of peptone from gelatin, 7 g/L of yeast extract, 1.2 g/L of l-arginine, and 1 g/L of glucose was the best for syngas fermentation, herein called TPYGarg. The development of a culture medium with no yeast extract, but with vitamins (biotin, pantothenic, and p -aminobenzoic acid), ammonia, trace me tals, minerals, cysteine, sodium sulfide, and resazurin w as reported by Phillips et al. (2015) . After 200 h, around 3.0 g/L of et hanol (approximately, 0.015 g/L. h) was obtained in a medium 27 -times cheaper than the standard one (ZHANG; TAYLOR; WANG, 2016) . Despite cheaper, this medium still requires 2 0 components and demands time to prepare it. A ATCC® 1754 modified medium was proposed by Ramachandryia (2015) , using cotton seed extract (CSE) and morpholinoethanesulfonic acid (MES), with no yeast extract, resulting in 2.78 g/L of ethanol after 350 h of fermentation (approximately, 0.008 g/L h). A modification in the ATCC® 1754 medium with MES as buffer was also reported, leading to 6.1 g/L of ethanol in a two stirred tank bioreactor (in series) (DOLL et al., 2018) , without considering the high cost of MES. Enhancement of alcohol synthesis was reported using CO -rich off -gas fermentation by C. carboxidivorans by adding molybdenum/iron/cupper, aiming at the enzymes of the microorganism metabolism (SHEN et al., 2017) . A final ethanol concentration of 3.5 g/L was obtained after 72 h of fermentation (approximately, 0.049 g/L .h), the higher productivity found for this process in literature so far, but without considering the culture medium cost. Cell growth, glucose consumption, and medium pH were monitored during syngas fermentation in TPYGarg and high biomass was obtained as well as the detection of two phases: pH reduction in the beginning followed by pH increase. In classical ABE fermentation using glucose as sole carbon source or in HBE fermentation using gaseous substrate, the bioconversion by Clostridia occurs in two steps. First, the exponential bacterial growth and organic acids production can be observed, known as the acidogenesis phase. Then, those acids are converted into solvents as ethanol, butanol, and acetone in the ABE process, and hexanol, butanol, and ethanol in the HBE", "Chapter 4 process, known as the solventogenic phase. The acidogenic phase usually shows greater efficiency at neutral or slightly high pH values, leading to the medium acidification due to acid production. Concerning ABE fermentation, studies have reported that the solventogenic phase is stimulat ed during medium acidification (FERNÁNDEZ -NAVEIRA; VEIGA; KENNES, 2017a) . On the other hand, HBE fermentation studies have demonstrated that alcohol production usually occurs near pH 6.0 (ABUBACKAR et al., 2016) . Below this pH level, low alcohol production and a decreasing growth capacity are usually attributed to the “acid crash” phenomenon (MADDOX et al., 2000) .", "In the present study, solvent production started while glucose was being consumed and cel ls were growing. Although, it is expected that solventogenic phase only starts after medium acidification as result of acid production, the production of organic acids and solvents occurred simultaneously in the present study. Formation of organic acids occurs during exponential growth, decreasing the culture pH level, making it unfavorable for the cell population and resulting in a metabolic change at the end of the exponential phase. Therefore, those organic acids are partly re-assimilated and rebuilt into neutral products as the solvents. However, not all species and strains of solventogenic clostridia have the same behavior. Lipovsky et al. (2016) and Branska et al. (2018) verified butanol production associated with the cell growth by clostridia via the acetone –butanol –ethanol (ABE) pathway.", "When using syngas as the only carbon source for C. carboxidivorans fermentation, a mixture of organic acids as acetic, butyric, and hexanoic acids was expected, and further partial conversion of those acids into respective alcohols, following HBE fermentation process. Using glucose as the only carbon source, ABE fermentation was expected, producing lactic, acetic, formic, and propionic acids, which then could be converted into acetone, ethanol, and butanol. However, it was observed that C. carboxidivorans does not follow classical ABE or HBE fermentations when both carbon sources were used (glucose and CO/CO 2), since acids and alcohols production were detected at the same time on TPYGarg and ATCC® 2713 media.", "Higher growth rates and alcohol productivities obtained in the mixotrophic fermentation (glucose and CO/CO 2) when compared to heterotrophic (glucose) and autotrophic (CO/CO 2) processes reported in the literature (FAST et al., 2015b) , is probably the result of the two metabolic pathways synergy, glycolysis and Wood –", "Chapter 4 Ljungdahl. The glycolysis converts glucose into pyruvate, producing 2 mol of pyruvate, two ATP, and four electrons. The pyruvate is converted to acetyl -CoA, an important intermediate for biofuel production, which results in the release of 2 mol of CO 2 and 4 additional electrons (FAST et al., 2015b) . The autotrophi c metabolism, known as Wood –Ljungdahl (WL) pathway, consists of two branches. In the methyl branch, CO 2 is reduced to a methyl group consuming six electrons and one ATP. While in the carbonyl branch, CO 2 is reduced to CO consuming two electrons. The CO and the methyl group formed in this first step of WL pathway are converted into 1 mol of acetyl -CoA (FAST et al., 2015b; JONES et al., 2016; REDL et al., 2017) . Thereby, the glycolysis and WL are complementary pathways as CO 2 and electrons produced in the glycolysis are fully utilized by W L to produce one additional mol of acetyl -CoA increasing its yield by 50% in relation to glucose metabolism. Besides, the syngas feed contributes to enhance the metabolic flow of the WL pathway, as CO, CO 2, and H2 are introduced (FAST et al., 2015b) .", "5 PARTIAL CONCLU SIONS", "Experimental design is a powerful tool for reducing culture medium components . In the present study, a PB design followed by CCRD indicated that tryptone, yeast extract, and L -arginine were the most important culture medium for C. carboxidivorans growth from syngas. The proposed medium for C. carboxidivorans growth, herein named TYA (14 g/L tryptone, 9 g/L yeast extract, and 1.4 g/L L -arginine) is cheaper (47%) than ATCC® 2713 and reduced in components. For ethanol production, peptone and glucose were also relevant. After applying an experimental design sequence, a culture medium for syngas fermentation by C. carboxidivorans was proposed and named TPYGarg (12 g/L tryptone, 12 g/L peptone from gelatin, 7 g/L yeast extract, 1.2 g/L L -arginine, and 1 g/L glucose). Almost five -times higher ethanol concentration and more than two -times hig her butanol concentration were produced on TPYGarg in comparison to ATCC® 2713.

Clostridium carboxid ivorans can metabolize gaseous substrates as CO and CO 2 to produce ethanol and higher alcohols through the Wood - Ljungdahl pathway. Howeve r, the syngas fer mentation is limited by low mass transfer rates. In this work, a syngas fermentation was carried out in serum glass bottles adding different concentrations of Tween® 80 in ATCC® 2713 culture medium to improve gas - liquid mass transfer. We observed a 200% increase in ethanol production by adding 0.15% (v/v) of the surfactant in the culture mediu m and a 15% increase in biomass production by adding 0.3% (v/v) of the surfactant in the cultur e medium.

The use of fossil -based energy has been declining since its use drives climate changes and air pollution (GILDEMYN et al., 2017) . Additionally, the constant fluctuation of oil prices caused by political and economic instability around the world brings insecurity to this industrial sector (MOHAMMADI et al., 2011) .", "In this scenario, there is an increasing demand for renewable and carbon - neutral fuels, especially those produced through microbial fermentation, such as ethanol and butanol (BENEVENUTI et al., 2020; UKPONG et al., 2012) . Initially, ethanol was the main focus, which can either be a stand -alone fuel or a gasoline - ethanol blend (UKPONG et al., 2012) . However, its low cal oric value and hygroscopicity limit the use and transportation of ethanol in the current infrastructure. Therefore, the interest in butanol as a liquid fuel, which is less hygroscopic and provides higher caloric value in comparison to ethanol, has increase d in recent years (MUNASINGHE; KHANAL, 2011) . Currently, those alcohols are produced through direct fermentation of suga rs extracted from food or energy crops, with pretreatment steps to hydrolyze carbohydrate polymers, increasing costs and byproduct formation (BOBOESCU et al., 2017; SUN; CHENG, 2002) .", "Chapter 5 The indirect fermentation, or hybrid process, consists of the conversion of a wide variety of carbonaceous compounds to synthesis gas, also named syngas, through gasifica tion, followed by its fermentation to desired products by specific biocatalysts (DATAR et al., 2004) . Syngas, mainly co mposed of CO (carbon monoxide), CO 2 (carbon dioxide), and H 2 (hydrogen), can be obtained from biomass, coal, animal or municipal solid waste, and industrial CO -rich off -gases (SUN et al., 2019c) . The hybrid process uses whole biomass components, including lign in, is not dependent on feedstock composition, and eliminates complex pretreatments and high enzyme costs (SHEN; BROWN; WEN, 2014a) .", "Several Clostridium species are known to produce biofuels, but only a few of them use syngas as sole carbon and energy sources (LIBERATO et al., 2019) .

C. carboxidivorans growth profiles in ATCC® 2713 medium with different concentrations of Tween ® 80 were similar.

Since syngas is not continuously fed in serum bottles, cell growth reaches the stationary phase, when there is a balance between growth and death of cells. Fernández -Naveira et al.

Most acetogenics show a defined pattern of metabolites production, in which acids are produced in a first stage called acetogenesis, followed by the conversion of these acids into the respective alcohols, called solventogenesis. Ethanol production by Clostridium carboxidivorans has its particularities. It can be produced either directly from acetyl -CoA in a two -step reaction via acetaldehyde, requiring 4 molecules of NADH, or via acetate and subsequent reduction to acetaldehyde, producing 1 molecule of ATP and consuming 4 NADH p er molecule of ethanol produced. Therefore, acetic acid produced during syngas fermentation by Clostridium carboxidivorans is an important indicator of potential ethanol production (DANIELL; KÖPKE; SIMPSON, 2012) .", "In our previous studi es, we have identified that ethanol production by this strain in ATCC® 2713 medium increases gradually until 24 h, then stabilizes. In other culture mediums, it starts to increase again after 70 h (BENEVENUTI et al., 2020) . So, we decided to sample serum bottle fermenta tions at strategic points (24 h - the first peak, 96 h - the second peak, and then 120 h, to verify final stabilization) to avoid volume reduction. Higher acetic acid concentration was obtained in pure ATCC® 2713 medium (4.44 g/L) after 120 h of syngas fermentation, which is 85% more than the amount obtained in ATCC® 2713 medium containing Tween® 80 (2.3 g/L) (Figure 3).", "Chapter 5", "Figure 3..

The addition of Tween® 80 in ATCC® 2713 medium resulted in less acetic acid accumulation and higher ethanol production, probably due to the greater availability of inorganic carbon (CO and CO 2) and protons (NADH) generated by important Wood - Ljungdahl enzymes as hydrogenases (HYA) and carbon monoxide dehydrogenases (CODH). The surfactant could improve carbon monoxide (CO) and carbon dioxide (CO 2) availability, resulting not only in more carbon fixation in the pathway but also more proton generation to be consumed in the following steps.", "Chapter 5", "Figure 4.

At CMC, the lowest superficial tension and, therefore, the largest interfacial area between gas and aqueous phase is attained. Probably, better results of ethanol production using 0.15% Tween® 80 are related to the increase in mass transfer of the substrates (CO and CO 2) from syngas to the aqueous phase for microbial assimilation. There was no butan ol production during 120 h of syngas fermentation by Clostridium carboxidivorans in serum bottles. Since the use of ATCC® 2713 medium with 0.15% ( v/v) Tween® 80 led to higher ethanol production and represented lower cost compared to the medium with 0.30% Tween® 80 (v/v), we decided to use 0.15% Tween® 80 for the validation experiment in stirred tank bioreactor.", "Chapter 5", "3.2 Stirred Tank Bioreactor Fermentation", "Cell Growth C. carboxidivorans growth in ATCC® 2713 medium with 0.15% ( v/v) Tween® 80 was monitored during 120 h of syngas fermentation in STBR (Figure 5).

According to Shen et al. (2017) , despite ethanol being considered a non -growth -associated metabolite in C. carboxidivorans syngas fermentation, there is evidence which indicates that it is produced in both growth - and non -growth -associated phases. This can happen because the bacteria can use glucose for growth and the Wood -Ljungdahl pathway to metabolize CO as a c arbon source for ethanol production simultaneously if the diffusion of the gaseous substrates is efficient (SHEN et al., 2017) .

The increase in biomass, ethanol, and butanol productions is probably a result of an enhancement in the gas -liquid mass transfer coefficient due to the bioreactor configuration as well as the addition of Tween® 80 in the culture medium as observed in the serum bottles fermentation. Studies hav e concluded that low concentrations of surface -active additives can affect gas -liquid mass transfer parameters such as the volumetric mass transfer coefficient (k La) (BLANCO et al., 2013; VASCONCELOS et al., 2003) . Belo et al. (2011 ) studied the influence of Tween® 80 in hydrodynamic parameters and mass transfer of carbon dioxide (CO 2) in aqueous solution. The presence of Tween® 80 generated an important increase in the gas -liquid interfacial area caused by a decrease in the bubble di ameter. As reported by Coelho et al.

Considering that in this study, we proposed a continuous syngas feed at a very low flow rate and a simple reactor configuration, with no pressure or pH control. The ethanol produ ctivity obtained was promising compared to studies reported in the literature using similar substrates, operational conditions, and microorganisms. Tween® 80 is a relatively cheap input (US $30/L at Millipore Sigma website - https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/US/en - accessed on July 30, 2021), and a small amount is needed to increase ethanol production (0.0015 L per liter of culture medium). Moreover, it is suit able for microbial culture, without toxicity to bacterial cells (BREDWELL et al., 1997) . Although Bredwell et al. ( 1997) have tested Tween® 80 in carbon monoxide fermentation, this is the first report in the literature concerning the effect of different concentrations of Tween® 80 in syngas fermentations and its validation in bioreactor scale. Tween® 80 can cause fo am depending on concentration, medium composition, mechanical agitation, and gas flow rate, and serum bottles do not evaluate this problem. We have validated the use of Tween® 80 in syngas fermentation in a bioreactor since we detected product formation and no foam was observed. Besides, the gas composition used herein is much more realistic when compared to syngas obtained from waste material pyrolysis (DAS et al., 2021) .

PARTIAL CONCLUSIONS", "The effect caused by the addition of Tween® 80 to ATCC® 2713 medium was evidenced by an increase in biomass and ethanol production during Clostridium carboxidivorans syngas fermentation in serum bottles and validated in a stirred tank bioreactor. The presence of this surfactant probably led to the reduction of bubble size, increasing the gas -liquid interfacial area, which resulted in the increase of CO and CO 2 mass transfer coefficients.

This genus of anaerobic bacteria is capable of metabolizing organic and inorganic substrates as glycerol, lignocellulosic hydrolysates, carbon dioxide (CO 2), and carbon monoxid e (CO) , in a biorefinery context. Clostridium carboxidivorans is a promising specie to gaseous substrate assimilation to solvents and biofuels production, through Wood -Ljungdahl pathway. The major bottleneck of syngas fermentation technology is the low mas s transfer in gas -liquid system. To overcome this drawback many approaches have been proposed , including the addition of surfactants to the culture medium, the bioreactor design , and the construction of genet ically modified strai ns.", "An important variable that impacts directly on products generation in the syngas fermentation is the gas composition . The feedstock composition, the gasifying agent, the type of gasifier and the gasification parameters determine the syngas composition and conseq uently, show expressive impact on the productivity of biomass and bioproducts. T he content of contaminants and specially the H 2/CO ratio are directly related to carbon conversion efficiency as H 2 and CO can be used as an elect ron donor for several reduction reactions of the metabolic pathway of Clostridium sp. Anaerobic bioprocess is usually represented by low cell density . The approach used to improve biomass and ethanol productivities , as well as to reduce costs of culture medium was a sequence of experimental design. The optimal medium composition obtained to cell growth (TYA) increased biomass production by 77%, compared to ATCC® 2713 medium, reducing the cost by 47%. TPYGarg medium increased ethanol production more than 4-fold and the cost was reduced by 31%. Aiming to improve the mass transfer coefficient of gaseous substrates in aqueous phase, the surfactant Tween® 80 was added to ATCC® 2713, a common medium used in anaerobic bioprocesses. In serum bottles, 0.3% (v/v) of Tween® 80 showed the highest biomass c oncentration, 15% more than pure ATCC® 2713 medium. More than 3 -fold higher ethanol production was detected with 0.15%(v/v) of Tween® 80 after 96h. The addi tion of Tween® 80 to the culture medium resulted in less acetic acid and more ethanol productions in serum bottle fermentation probably due to the largest generation of protons (NADH) by Wood Ljungdahl enzymes as hydrogenases (HYA) and carbon monoxide dehy drogenases (CODH). In bioreactor,", "0.15% Tween® 80 in ATCC® 2713 led to an increase of 106% in biomass concentration compared to serum bottle fermentation but the same eth anol concentration was achieved. However, ethanol productivity was 78% higher in bioreactor and 0.43 g/L of butanol was detected, which was null in serum bottles fermentation. This was probably a result of the greater availability of gaseous substrate in bioreactor configuration and the best system agitation which promoted an increase in mass transfer.", "SUGGESTION FOR FUTURE WORKS • Evaluate biomass and metabolites production during syngas fermentation by Clostridium carboxidivorans using TPYGarg medium with 0.15% Tween® 80 in serum bottles and in stirred tank bioreactor .", "• Characterize the gas composition during syngas fermentation in serum bottles and in stirred tank bioreactor using Gas Chromatography .", "• Calculate the mass transfer coefficient of each gaseous substrate in d ifferent concentration of Tween® 80.", "• Investigate the influence of different syngas composition s on biomass and metabolities production.", "• Evaluate the mass transfer coefficient of all gaseous substrate s and the production of metabolites production in pressurized bioreactor.", "• Survey new possible chemical compounds capable to enhance mass transfer coefficient of CO and CO 2 in aqueous phase .", "Chapter 2 APPENDIX A Full s cientific paper 1 “Clostridium sp. as bio -catalyst for fuels and chemicals production in a biorefinery context” Catalyst Published: November 15th, 2019", "Chapter 2 ABSTRACT Clostridium sp. is a genus of anaerobic bacteria capable of metabolizing several substrates (monoglycerides, diglycerides, glycerol, carbon monoxide, cellulose, and more), into valuable products. Biofuels, such as ethanol and butanol, and several chemicals, such as a cetone, 1,3 -propanediol, and butyric acid, can be produced by these organisms through fermentation processes. Among the most well -known species, Clostridium carboxidivorans, C. ragsdalei, and C. ljungdahlii can be highlighted for their ability to use gaseo us feedstocks (as syngas), obtained from the gasification or pyrolysis of waste material, to produce ethanol and butanol. C. beijerinckii is an important species for the production of isopropanol and butanol, with the advantage of using hydrolysate lignoce llulosic material, which is produced in large amounts by first -generation ethanol industries. High yields of 1,3 propanediol by C. butyricum are reported with the use of another by -product from fuel industries, glycerol. In this context, several Clostridiu m wild species are good candidates to be used as biocatalysts in biochemical or hybrid processes.

Water, soil, and air pollution generated by anthropogenic actions have caused climate change, resource depletion, global warming, water crises, and the increase of natural disasters in recent years (\"Climate Change 2014: Synthesis Report\", 2014) . Many researchers and initiatives are committed to search and deve lop new techniques, feedstocks, and processes towards a sustainable economy that will be less dependent on oil as a source of energy and chemical production (CHERUBINI, 2010) . One approach is to progressively change our primary source of fuels and chemicals, decreasing the dependency on oil and oil products due to oil’s environmental impact, depletion possibi lity, and market price oscillations caused by oil and financial crises. The Sustainable Development Goals adopted by global leaders at the 2015 United Nations Summit set the path for 17 goals to be achieved by 2030, such as: affordable and clean energy (SD G7); industries, innovation and infrastructure (SDG9); responsible production and consumption (SDG12); and climate action", "Chapter 2 Many feedstocks can be used to produce renewable and sustainable fuels and chemicals, especially residu al organic materials, industrial waste -streams, and by - products. The use of glycerol, molasses, corn steep liquor, energy crops, grass silage, cattle slurry, harvest residues, and food processing waste can reduce operational costs (associated with feedstoc k acquisition) and environmental impact due to improper disposal of residue (AL SEADI et al., 2013; CHERUBINI, 2010; DROSG et al., 2013; HASSAN; WILLIAMS; JAISWAL, 2019; LATIF et al., 2014; MURPHY et al., 2011; SHEN et al., 2015) . These are renewable feedstocks that can be transformed into valuable biofuels (e.g., biobutanol and bioethanol) and biochemicals (lactic acid, butyric acid, and succinic acid), achieving a balance between environmental sustainability and economic growth in a process named biorefining (HASSAN; WILLIAMS; JAISWAL, 2019) . Biorefining is defined as “the sustainable processing of biomass into a spectrum of marketable food and feed ingredients, bio -based products (chemicals, materials) and bioenergy (biofuels, power and/or heat)” (IEA BIOENERGY, 2014) . In a biorefinery, components of biomass are organized as building bl ocks (e.g., cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin, and proteins) and the biorefinery concept encompasses the whole processing of biomass, considering upstream, midstream, and downstream processing (CHERUBINI, 2010; PARADA et al., 2017) . The main challenge is the feasible production of biofuels and biochemicals in a cost effective, efficient, and sustainable way (CHERUBINI, 2010) . Although using renewable feedstock, biorefinery sustainability should also consider others aspects, such as land use for biomass producti on, soil, and air quality during processing, and environmental and economic impacts (PARAJULI et al., 2015) .", "Considering biochemical conversion processes, microbial cells are a central aspect of biomass conversion, functioning as biocatalysts that convert liquid, solid, or gaseous substrates into alcohols, acids, enzymes, and ot her products through a series of metabolic reactions. In particular, Clostridium species have been involved in many important fermentative processes, such as the production of butanol, acetone, ethanol, acetic acid, lactic acid, succinic acid, 1,3 -propaned iol, and more (DANIELL; KÖPKE; SIMPSON, 2012; KÖPKE et al., 2010; LIOU et al., 2005; SCHIEL -BENGELSDORF; DÜRRE, 2012) .

Among the species of the genus there are those that synthesize quinones and cytoch romes, acidophiles, thermophiles, and psychrophiles (VOS et al., 2011) .

With the presence or absence of flagella, a single cell may be mo tile, usually with peritrichous flagella, or immotile. They do not reduce sulfates and are, generally, catalase negative (LAWSON; RAINEY, 2016) . Most species have sporulation capacity, which can be directly affected by presence of oxygen, because they are anaerobic. However, species of Clostridium genus have different oxygen toler ance capacities (VOS et al., 2011) . Most species are chemotrophic; some are chemoautotrophic or chemolithotrophic. They may be saccharolytic, proteolytic, none , or both. Metabolically they are very diverse, with optimum temperature between 10 and 65 °C. They are distributed in the environment. Many species produce potent exotoxins, and some species are pathogenic to animals, both by infection of wounds and by ab sorption of toxins (GOMES, 2013) .", "When exposed to nutrient -depleting conditions, alternative metabolic pathways of clos tridia are activated.

The fermentation processes of the different species a re divided into three main fermentations: ABE (acetone -butanol -ethanol), IBE (isopropanol -butanol -ethanol) and HBE (hexanol - butanol -ethanol). The latter was recently proposed by a research group that has been studying the C. carboxidivorans P7 strain (FERNÁNDEZ -NAVEIRA et al., 2017; FERNÁNDEZ -NAVEIRA; VEIGA; KENNES, 2017b) .", "Independently of the end products, each strain can use different metabolic pathways based on the available carbon source and its genetic information. Different carbohydrates, for example, are fermented through different pathways by Clostridia. In the case of hexoses, thei r metabolism follows the Embden -Meyerhof -Parnas (EMP) pathway, whereas the metabolism of pentoses takes p lace through the pentose phosphate (PP) pathway (FERNÁNDEZ -NAVEIRA; VEIGA; KENNES, 2017b) . On the other hand, to assimilate CO, CO 2, and H 2 for HBE fe rmentation, C. carboxidivorans uses the Wood -Ljungdahl pathway (FERNÁNDEZ -NAVEIRA et al., 2017; FERNÁNDEZ -NAVEIRA; VEIGA; KENNES, 2017b) . These fermentation processes and biochemical pathways will be discuss ed in this section. Acetone -Butanol -Ethanol (ABE) fermentation ABE fermentation was used on a large scale during the First World War. Acetone was produced by C. acetobutylicum to be used by England for warlike applications. However, the development of the petrochemical industry after the Second World War, decreased the interest in ABE fermentation to obtain those products. Recently, environmental problems related to the use of fossil fuels and economic reasons have again increased the interest for ABE ferme ntation (JONES; WOODS,", "Chapter 2 ABE fermentation is composed of two phases: acidogenic and solventogenic. The first is characterized by organic acid production (butyric and acetic), and the second by assimilation of these acids as a carbon source for subsequent transformation into aceton e, butanol, and ethanol. Generally, molar the acetone:butanol:ethanol ratio is 6:3:1,but it can vary from species to species (JONES; WOODS, 1986; KEIS; SHAHEEN; JONES, 2001) .The most common and best known solventogenic clostridial strains for commercial butanol fermentation are C. acetobutylicum , C. beijerinckii , C. saccharobutylicum , and C.", "saccharoperbutylacetonicum (FERNÁNDEZ -NAVEIRA; VEIGA; KENNES, 2017b) . The use of lignocellulosic biomass in ABE fermentation for butanol production has been studied by several authors as a solution for the environmental issues mentioned. However, carbon catabolic repression (CCR) reduces the efficiency of the process since glucose, usually produced after a pre -treatment of the biomass, suppresses the use of other sugars, such as xylose and arabinose, which are also produced (FAST et al., 2015b; NOGUCHI et al., 2013) . For butanol production by C. acetoperbutylacetonicum , Noguchi et al (2013) used a different pre -treatment and saccharification of lignocellulosic material tha t generates cellobiose rather than glucose, and xylose, avoiding CCR. Butanol productivity increased with this strategy. Recently, it was also demonstrated that biochar (a by -product obtained from thermochemical conversion of biomass under oxygen limited c onditions) can serve as a cost -effective substitute for mineral and buffer solutions in ABE fermentation (SUN Isopropanol -Butanol -Ethanol (IBE) Fermentation Butanol has been considered an advanced biofuel and its production at a scale of billions of liters by ABE fermentation may res ult in oversupply of acetone (DOS SANTOS VIEIRA et al., 2019) . IBE fermentation is a solution to the acetone problem, because in this process naturally -occurring strains can convert acetone in isopropanol, resulting in the production of isopropanol, butanol, and ethanol. Additional advantages are the possibility to use this mixture directly as a fuel and the removal of a high corrosive substance with low fuel properties (LI et al., 2019) .", "C. beijerinckii is one o f the main species that produce IBE.

Thus, buffering the culture medium for HBE fermentation by C. carboxidivorans may induce higher acid production and promote greater conversion in the solventogenic phase. However, further investigation and applications of genetic en gineering are necessary to reduce the inhibitory effect of high concentrations of solvents and acids produced (FERNÁNDEZ -NAVEIRA; VEIGA; KENNES, 2017b) .", "Embden -–Meyerhof -–Parnas (EMP) pathway and Pentose phosphate (PP) pathway EMP and PP pathways for Clostridium species to metabolize hexoses and pentoses, respectively, have been shown by several authors (FERNÁNDEZ - NAVEIRA; VEIGA; KENNES, 2017b; RAGANATI et al., 2015; SHINTO et al., 2008) . Agro -industrial wastes, commonly used as feedstocks for biofuel production , generate mainly glucose, arabinose, mannose, xylose, fructose, sucrose, and lactose as substrates after a pre -treatment process (FERNÁNDEZ -NAVEIRA; VEI GA; KENNES, The nature of the sugars is a key parameter that will affect the efficiency of the fermentation process and the production of metabolites (FERNÁNDEZ -NAVEIRA;", "Chapter 2 VEIGA; KENNES, 2017b) . Monosaccharides are transported by a faster system than disaccharides. In the case of glucose and fructose, EMP is directly used. For galactose, for example, after being phosphorylated, galactose ‐6‐P is metabolized via the tagatose 6 ‐P pathway and subsequently enters the glycolytic pathway. These differences result in different consumption rates between sucrose and lactose (FERNÁNDEZ -NAVEIRA; VEIGA; KENNES, 2017b; SHINTO et al., 2008) . In the case of pentoses, which are usually mixed with hexoses, there is the carbon catabolic repression (CCR) issue, which suppresses pentose consumption because of the preferable use of glucose (FAST et al., 2015b; NOGUCHI et al., 2013) . Wood -Ljungdahl pathway The Wood -Ljungdahl (WL) pathway provides acetate from inorganic sources, such as H 2, CO, and CO 2.

In the methyl branch, formate is obtained through the reduction of CO 2. In the carbonyl branch, CO or CO 2 can be taken directly and converted into acetyl -CoA (FERNÁNDEZ -NAVEIRA; VEIGA; KENNES, 2017b) . Growth of acetogenic bacteria is possible because of the formation of acetate from 2 mols of CO 2, with H 2 as a reducing agent and, therefore, this pathway must be coupled with ATP formation. This is believed to be the oldest biochemical pathway, responsible for producing biomass and ATP in the ancient world (FERNÁNDEZ -NAVEIRA et al., 2017) . In the first step of the methyl group, the possibility of CO assimilat ion followed by the action of CO desidrogenase generates two protons and two electrons that can be used as inputs to format desidrogenase action on the following reaction. In other words, the WL pathway is capable of sustaining the autotrophic growth of th e microorganism only with CO, even without H 2 for electron donation (SUN et al., 2018; TSVETANOVA; PETROVA; PETROV, 2018b) . In heterotrophic conditions, alcohols, organic acids, an d simple sugars are able to donate electrons to the WL pathway (LI", "Chapter 2 In the Wood -Ljungdahl pathway, acetyl -CoA is a common intermediate of both branches.

Indust rial sugar production starts by extracting sugarcane or beet juice, which is then clarified and concentrated. The concentrated juice is subjected to successive crystallizations, followed by separation of sucrose crystals by centrifugation. The remaining vi scous liquid is molasses (GARCÍA et al., 2016; LINO; BASSO; SOMMER, Molasses composition varies a great deal among batches. Usually this by - product of sugar production is composed of water, approximately 45% –50% (w/w) total sugars (sucrose, glucose, and fructose), suspended colloids, heavy metals, vitamins, and nitrogenous compounds (LI et al., 2013a) . Due to its composition, a nimal feed and fertilizer are possible destinations for this viscous liquid. However, ethanol production by fermentation is one of its main applications (LINO; BASSO; SOMMER, 2018) . As it contains a high quantity of sugars, molasses is an inexpensive r enewable carbon source for several bioprocesses. Since a carbon source is necessary in relatively higher concentrations compared to other medium components, molasses is a good option to reduce raw material cost (FAROOQ et al., 2012; LINO; BASSO; SOMMER, 2018) . Molasses can be quite inhibitory to several organisms due to its salinity and osmolarity, and the presence of toxic elements, such as aluminium and sulphites, and thermal sugar degradation compounds (LINO; BASSO; SOMMER, In spite of molasses being mainly used for fuel ethanol production by fermentation, other potential molecules can be obtained by fermentation of this by - product. The most promising bioprocesses using molasses as substrate for Clostridium fermentations is acetone -butanol-ethanol (ABE) production. Considering the importance of butanol, studies for optimization of butanol production have been undertaken. Syed e Nadeem (2008) achieved high butanol production using blackstrap molasses as substrate. The autho rs compared butanol production by C.", "Chapter 2 acetobutylicum PTCC -23 to other mutant strains obtained by UV exposure and N - methyl -N-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine. Li et al. (2013) achieved a similar butanol concentration from cane molasses using C. beijerinckii mutant o btained by combined low-energy ion beam implantation and N -methyl -N-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine induction. While C. acetobutylicum and C. beijerinckii are the most encouraging species due to their ability to produce butanol from molasses (VAN DER MERWE et al., 2013) , literature reports high butyric acid production from molasses usi ng C. tyrobutyricum species (JIANG et al., 2009) . Li et al. (2013) improved butanol production by coculture of C. beijerinckii and C. tyrobutyricum , since C. tyrobutyricum produces butyric acid from molasses increasing the butyrate availability to butanol production by C. beijerinckii .", "In addition, several studies evidenced that molasses is a rich source of antioxidants, such as phenolic compounds. Among the phenolic compounds present in molasses it is possible to find the flavonoids, which show high antio xidant activity (GUAN et al., 2014; VALLI et al., 2012) . The a vailability and cost of sugar molasses make it an attractive feedstock to be used in many countries as raw material for fermentations, and also as a potential extra source of antioxidants, which are considered value added chemicals.", "6.3 Corn steep li quor", "Corn steep liquor (CSL) is a multicomponent and multiphase matrix, obtained as a major by -product of the corn wet -milling industry. It is a viscous concentrate of corn soluble containing amino acids, vitamins, minerals, and proteins. It has been used as a growth medium for Lactobacillus intermedius in mannitol production and for Saccharomyces cerevisiae in solvent production (DEAZEREDO et al., 2006) . The standard medium for Clostridium sp. growth is basically composed of yeast extract, vitamins, minerals, trace metals, reducing agents, and th e carbon source. The more expensive component is the reducing agent, followed by yeast extract. Yeast extract is a water -soluble portion produced by extracting the cells’ contents from autolyzed yeast, which may cost $1000 ton -1. An alternative to replace complex nutrient sources such as yeast extract is corn steep liquor, which costs around $200 t (MADDIPATI et al., 2011) .", "Chapter 2 Maddipatti et al. (2011) produced 32% more ethanol by Clostridium strain P11 using CSL instead of yeast extract. They also produced seven times more butanol using this by -product in relation to yeast extract. CSL also diversified the product range produced by C. carboxidivorans and C. ragsdalei , with maximum concentrations of ethanol , n-butanol, n -hexanol, acetic acid, butyric acid, and hexanoic acid of 2.78 g/L, 0.70 g/L, 0.52 g/L, 4.06 g/L, 0.13 g/L, and 0.42 g/L, respectively (RAMACHANDRIYA", "6.4 Lignocellulosic biomass", "Lignocellulosic biomass is a rigid and fibrous material present in herbaceous energy and food crops; forestry, agricultural, and agro -industrial residues; municipal solid waste; and waste streams from the pulp and paper indus try (SAHA, 2003) . This renewable and abundant feedstock represents a key opportunity towards a more sustainable economy, especially due to its capacity of sequestering carbon to the soil, which is not released to the atmosphere upon harvesti ng (ISIKGOR; BECER, 2015; TILMAN; HILL; LEHMAN, 2006) . Biofuels, biomolecules, and biomaterials produced from lignocellulosic materials present a promising alternative to crude oil, oil products, and fossil fuels due to their renewability, biocompatibility, biodegradability, and reduction in greenhouse gas emissions to the atmosphere (AHN et al., 2012; MENON; This biomass is mainly composed of three differ ent biopolymers: cellulose (35% -50%), hemicellulose (20% -35%) and lignin (10% -25%), for which proportions depend on the feedstock origin, species, harvesting time, and growth stage [120,121,125]. Acetyl groups, minerals, phenolic substituents, and ash are other constituents that can be found in this biomass (ISIKGOR; BECER, 2015; TILMAN; HILL; LEHMAN, 2006) . Cellulose is a linear microfibril formed by D -glucose subunits linked th rough β -1,4 glyosidic bonds and has cellobiose as a repetitive unit (ISIKGOR; BECER, 2015) . Its cohesive structure is assembled by intramolecular and intermolecular hydrogen bonds and is 85% crystalline and 15% amorphous (HENDRIKS; ZEE MAN, 2009; ISIKGOR; BECER, 2015) . Cellulose is embedded in hemicellulose and lignin. Hemicellulose is a branched and amorphous structure containing different heteropolysaccharides (xylan, glucomannan, arabinoxylan,etc.), which are composed of pentose (D -xylose and L -arabinose) and hexose (D -glucose,", "Chapter 2 D-galactose, and D -mannose) sugar units (ISIKGOR; BECER, 2015; MENON; RAO, 2012) . In a ddition, hemicellulose has organic acids (acetic and glucuronic acids) in its structure, whose predominance is dependent on its origin (angiosperms vs. gymnosperms). The hemicellulose of angiosperms is highly acetylated. Upon pretreatment, these acetyl gro ups partially catalyze the hydrolysis of hemicellulose. Lignin is an amorphous and hydrophobic polymeric structure composed of the alcohols p-coumaryl, coniferyl, and sinapyl, and is responsible for the biomass’s tough structure, impermeability, and resist ance to microbial and oxidative attacks (ISIKGOR; BECER, 2015; SHEN et al., 2015) . This phenolic macromolecule displays variations in both chemical composition and structure due to a low degree of order and a high level of heterogeneity.", "Different routes can be considered to transform lig nocellulosic biomass into important biofuels and biochemicals, which elucidate the importance of this feedstock in biorefineries. Table 2 summarizes processes and end -products commonly obtained using lignocellulosic biomass as a feedstock in three conversi on routes. The thermo - chemical, biochemical, and hybrid routes use lignocellulosic materials by chemical and biochemical processes, generating important products and building blocks for the chemical and pharmaceutical industries. However, one of the main c oncerns regarding lignocellulosic biomass is the food crop competition between energy and food production, which is a reality in the production of first -generation biofuels from sugar and vegetable oil (CHERUBINI, 2010; MENON; RAO, 2 012). Therefore, the production of second -generation biofuels is an alternative to produce ethanol, biodiesel, and other products from non -food crops, such as agricultural and agro -industrial residues, and forestry and energy crops (CHERUBINI, 2010) . This leads to valuable biochemical and biofuel production from less valuable feedstock, mainly in the form of residue. The use of residues as feedstock improves the sustainability of the process by reducing residue accumulation in the environment and, therefore, reducing many problematic effects, such as greenhouse gas emissions in landfills and dumps, and cont amination of groundwater (CHERUBINI, 2010; LI et al., 2016b) .", "Chapter 2 Table 3.

Physical pretreatment, such as milling, irradiation, and extrusion, are commonly us ed to increase the surface area of the biomass and reduce its crystallinity to improve the enzymatic hydrolysis of its components (MENON; RAO, 2012) . Catalyzed and non -catalyzed steam explosion, ammonia fiber explosion (AFEX), liquid hot water, and microwave -chemical are examples of physico -chemical pretreatments (MENON; RAO, 2012) . Hydrothermal processing has also been assessed in literature to separate lignocellulosic biomass into cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin in a biorefinery conce pt (RUIZ et al., 2013) . Common to the paper industry, chemical pretreatments encompass the use of acid and alkaline compounds, ionic liquids, and hot water at a controlled pH to remove lignin and hemicellulose in order to decrease the lignocellulosic material polymerization degree and crystallinity, and enhance biomass porosity (MENON; RAO, 2012) .", "Cellulases and hemicellulases can be used to convert cellulose and hemicellulose to fermentable sugars (ISIKGOR; BECER, 2015; MENON; RAO, 2012) . Bagasse, straws, and fibers have an interesting quantity of C5 and C6 sugars that can", "Chapter 2 be used to produce second -generation biofuels and other chemicals in the context of a biorefinery. Although the pretreated hydrolyzed lignocellulosic material is commonly used to produce ethanol by yeasts such as Saccharomyces, Kluveryomyces, Debaryomyces, Pichia, and Zymomo nas, these materials can also be used in ABE fermentation by Clostridium species (ISIKGOR; BECER, 2015; MENON; RAO, 2012) . Moreover, i t is possible to produce not only ethanol but also butanol, which is a promising liquid fuel. Butanol -producing bacteria Clostridium sp. can uptake a wide range of hexoses, pentoses, and oligomers obtained from the hydrolysis of cellulose and hemicellulose (AMIRI; KARIMI, 2018) . Corn fiber hydrolysate was used for C. beijerinckii fermentation resulting in the production of 9.3 g/L ABE (QURESHI et al., 2008) . The same species was used to convert t he wheat straw steam -exploded hydrolysates, yielding 128 g ABE/kg wheat straw (BELLIDO et al., 2014) . Seven grams per liter of butanol were produced from conc entrated sugar maple hemicellulosic hydrolysate by C. acetobutylicum ATCC824 (SUN; LIU, 2012) .", "Even t hough lignin is recalcitrant to micro -organisms, it can play an important role through chemical conversions leading to the production of methanol and BTX (benzene, toluene, xylene) phenols and phenolics (ISIKGOR; B ECER, 2015; RUIZ - DUEÑAS; MARTÍNEZ, 2009) .", "The thermochemical conversion of lignocellulosic biomass involves the use of heat and catalysts, while in the biochemical conversion organic matter is converted by micro -organisms through a series of metabolic r eactions. The thermochemical – biochemical conversion or hybrid route merges these two processes, converting biomass to a gaseous substrate using thermal energy, and the resulting gas is converted to bioproducts using bacterial cultures. The hybrid route con sists of the fast pyrolysis or gasification of lignocellulosic biomass producing synthesis gas (syngas), which is later converted to biofuels such as ethanol, butanol, butyrate, and 2,3 - butanediol, among others (HENSTRA et al., 2007; LATIF et al., 2014; LIOU et al., 2005; MOHAMMADI et al., 2011; ORGILL et al., 2013; SCHIEL -BENGELSDORF; DÜRRE, 2012) . In this way, all components of the lignocellulosic material are converted to synthesis gas and later fermented by Clostridium bacteria, overcoming the recalcitrant characteristic of this biomass and eliminating high costs related to the enzymatic pretreatment (SHEN et al., 2015) . Additionally, the adoption of this hybrid strategy for processing lignocellulosic biomass allows a more efficient use of it since", "Chapter 2 the whole biomass content (including lignin) can be converted to fuels and chemicals, not only the polysaccharide fractions as in the biochemical route. Nonetheless, process integration and optimization need to be done to make these processes attractive form an industrial standpoint.", "6.5 Syngas", "Synthesis gas or syngas is a gaseous mixture mainly composed of CO, H 2, and CO 2 that can present smaller quantities of methane (CH 4), hydrogen sulfide (H 2S), and nitrogen (N 2) depending on the biomass composition and conversion conditions (SHEN et al., 2015) . Different biomass sources, such as municipal solid waste, animal slurry, agricultural residue, energy crops, and coal can be used to produce syngas by pyrolysis or gasification (SHEN et al., 2015) . Fast pyrolysis of biomass occurs in an oxygen -free environment with moderate temperatures, resulting in syngas, biochar, and bio -oil, an energy rich liquid composed of car boxylic acids, sugars, alcohols, aldehydes, esters, ketones, aromatics, and furans (HUBER; IBORRA; CORMA, 2006; SHEN et al., 2015) . Bio-oil and synthesis gas c omposition depends on the pyrolysis technology implemented and biomass composition (SHEN et al., 2015) . Reactors used in fast pyrolysis, commonly fluidized bed reactors, must have a controlled temperature, high heat transfer rates, and rapid cooling of vapors (HUBER; IBORRA; CORMA, Biomass can be also converted to synthesis gas through gasification, which is conducted at higher temperature s than pyro lysis (800 -1000 °C), promoted by heat and/or electricity, and in the presence of a gasifying agent (HUBER; IBORRA; CORMA, 2006; SHEN et al., 2015; WOOLCOCK; BROWN, 2013 ). Synthesis gas is the main product of this thermochemical process, and biomass composition has an important impact on gas proportion and content, which can have trace amounts of sulfur (H 2S), hydrogen chlorine (HCl), alkali metals (potassium and sodiu m), tars, and ammonia (NH 3) (SHEN et al., 2015; WOOLCOCK; BROWN, 2013) . These contaminants can interfere in the microbial conversion of synthesis gas and therefore purification technologies should be implemented, such as wet scrubbing or hot/cold/warm gas clean up (WOOLCOCK; BROWN, 2013) . Biomass properties (ash, moisture, particle size), gasifying agent (air, steam, pure O 2), reactor type (updraft gasifier, downdraft gasifier, fluid -bed gasifier) and operational conditions (temperature,", "Chapter 2 fuel:gasifying agent ratio) also influence the synthesis gas composition (MOHAMMADI et al., 2011; WOOLCOCK; BROWN, 2013) .", "Synthesis gas conversion can produce important chemicals and fuels through the Fisher –Tropsch (chemical) process or fermentation (biochemical process) (SHEN et al., 2015) . The Fischer –Tropsch process involves catalyzation by iron, cobalt, or ruthenium, producing alcohols and liquid hydrocarbons at 200 -350 °C, a fixed H2:CO:CO 2 ratio, and a limited amount of impur ities (DRY, 2002) . The chemical conversion process has several drawbacks due to its catalytic and operational nature, including low catalyst specificity, high energetic demand, sensitivity to toxic gases and high pressure, and temperature conditions (PHILLIPS; CLAUSEN; GADDY, 1994; VEGA; CLAUSEN; GADDY, 1990; WORDEN et al., 1991) . The fermentation of synthesis gas obtained by the pyrolysis/gasification of biomass is considered a hybrid route since it is a combination of two conversion processes: thermochemical and biochemical [144]. Microbial conversion of syngas occurs at a determined temperature and pH, and can be performed by different acetogenic microorganisms ( C. ljungdahlii, C. autoethanogenum, Acetob acterium woodii, C. carboxidivorans P7, C. ragsdalei P11, Archaeoglobus fulgidus , etc.) and hydrogenic microorganisms ( Rhodospirillum rubum, Desulfotomaculum carboxydivorans, Themococcus onnurineus NA1, etc.) producing acetate, butyrate, ethanol, 2,3 -butan ediol, lactate, and others (KÖPKE et al., 2010; LIOU et al., 2005; MOHAMMADI et al., 2011; SHEN et al., 2015; YASIN et Synthesis gas fermentation has many advantages when compared to well - established processes in the chemical industry. Considerin g the Fischer –Tropsch process, syngas fermentation presents a higher tolerance to sulfur compounds; a variety of CO, H 2, and CO 2 ratios in synthesis gas that can be used as a substrate and not a fixed ratio; lower operational pressure and temperature, which decreases operational costs; and high productivity and product uniformity (LATIF et al., 2014) . Regarding other biotechnological conversions of lignocellulosic biomass, synthesis gas fermentation eliminates a complex pre -treatment stage, which would enhance operational cost due to enzyme acquisition (SHEN et al., 2015) . All components of lignoc ellulosic biomass are converted (MUNASINGHE; KHANAL, 2012) . However, one of the major bottlenecks in this process, especially concerning commercialization, is the mass transfer between gas and liquid phases due to the low", "Chapter 2 solubility of synthesis ga s (BREDWELL; SRIVASTAVA; WORDEN, 1999; BREDWELL; WORDEN, 1998; WORDEN; BREDWELL, 1998) . The increase of gas solubility in culture media may enhance the availability of gaseous substrate to cells, improving both the ce ll’s autotrophic growth and product conversion (BREDWELL; WORDEN, 1998) . For micro -organisms to convert the gaseous substrate into fuels and chemicals, it is importa nt that the nutrient is internalized by the cell, which occurs in a certain pathway from the interior of the gas bubble to the cell cytoplasm. Although mass transfer can present many resistances during this pathway, most may be neglected in most bioreactor s except for the resistance near the gas –liquid interface, which is a function of gas diffusivity in the liquid phase, as well as the film thickness (KADIC, E.; HEINDEL, 2017) . The gas adsorption in the liquid phase is a limit ing step for gas –liquid mass transfer and is accounted for in the overall volumetric mass transfer, k La, which is increased when the gas mass transfer to the liquid phase increases (KADIC, E.; HEINDEL, 2017) . Consequently, produc tivity would increase in gas-liquid systems.", "Many approaches have been proposed in literature in or der to increase mass transfer in gas -liquid systems, such as gas specificity, increasing operational pressure, increasing gas and liquid flow rates, larger specific gas –liquid interfacial areas, different reactor configurations, different liquid phases, in novative impeller designs, mathematical approaches, and more (COELHO et al., 2019; KUMARESAN; NERE; JOSHI, 2006; MUNASINGHE; KHANAL, 2012, 2014; ORGILL et al., 2019; UNGERMAN; HEINDEL, 2007; YASIN et al., 2014) . Table 3 summarizes so me approaches reported in literature so far. Recently, the use of perfluorodecalin (PFC) and Tween® 80 improved carbon monoxide mass transfer to a liquid phase composed of distilled water, PFC, and Tween® 80 in a stirred tank reactor with a sparger and Rushton-type and Smith -type impellers (COE LHO et al., 2019) .", "Synthesis gas obtained from residues is a cheap feedstock that can be used to produce sustainable biofuels and chemicals (MOHAMMADI et al., 2011) .

Ethanol is a very versatile building block for industry. It can be used to generate chemicals such as ethylene, propylene, 1,3 -butadiene, and hydrocarbons, as well as in the production of oxygenated molecules, such as acetaldehyde, butanol, acetic acid, acetone, and dimethyl ether (CHENG; TIMILSINA, 2011; SUN; CHENG, 2002) .

Pure glycerol (25 g/L) formed more products (19 g/L) than crude glycerol (12 g/L). In these conditions, 1.94 g/L of ethanol, 9.23 g/L of 1,3 -propanediol, an d 7.73 g/L of butanol were obtained (KHANNA; GOYAL; MOHOLKAR, 2013) .", "Ethanol can also be produced from lignocellulosic materials, which is commonly called second -generation ethanol. Agricultural residues, such as sugar cane bagasse and corn stover, grasses, such as switchgrass, and forestry and wood residues have been studied in order to develop a cost -effective second -generation process using these plentiful feedstocks (CHENG; TIMILSINA, 2011; VOHRA et al., 2014) . In a very recent study, Singh et al. (2018) reported an ethanol production of 2.45 g/L during 120 h of cellulose batch fermentation (30 g/L) by C. thermocellum ATCC31924. C. thermocellum LL1275 produced 5 g/L of ethanol (productivity of 0.07 g/L.h) through batch fermentation with cellobiose as a substrate (LO et al., 2016) . It was reported that 8.5-times more ethanol was produced by a genetic engineered strain of C. cellulolyticum in comparison to the wild s train, using switchgrass as feedstock in a batch fermentation process (LI et al., 2012) .", "The production of ethanol with lig nocellulosic biomass can be processed through four different configurations, depending on the feedstock, the microorganism chosen, and the product desired. These configurations are known as SHF (separate hydrolysis and fermentation), SSF (simultaneous sacc harification and fermentation), SSCF (simultaneous saccharification and co -fermentation), and CBP (consolidated", "Chapter 2 bioprocessing) (DEVARAPALLI; ATIYEH, 2015) . In the SHF, the hydrolysis of the biomass and the hexose/pentose fermentations are carried out in separate reactors. The main advantage of this configuration is the possibility of performing each step in its optimal conditions of pH and temperature. However, high concentrations of glucose and/or cellobiose in the first step inhibit the cellulases and reduce their efficie ncies. The SSF configuration occurs with cellulose hydrolysis and hexose fermentation in the same bioreactor, reducing the inhibition of cellulases by end products as observed in the SHF, but making it difficult to process both steps in their optimum condi tions of pH and temperature. Furthermore, microorganisms used in the SSF are able to ferment only glucose, not being able to utilize xylose. The SSCF configuration is similar to the SSF, but glucose and xylose can be fermented in the same bioreactor, as so me genetically engineered strains are developed to ferment both substrates (DEVARAPALLI; ATIYEH, 2015; MARGEOT et al., 2009) . CBP configuration is represented by one single microorganism that produces enzymes to hydrolyze cellulose and hemicellulose, and converts the resulting sugars into ethanol. Thus, the enzyme production, hydrolysis, and fermentation steps occur in the same bioreactor, reducing costs and increasing process efficiency. However, this type of bi ocatalyst is still in the early development stage (LYND et al., 2003, 2005) . In 2014, a study reported the production of ethanol and butanol through SHF and SSF processes with C. acetobutylicum NBRC13948. In this work, corn and wood chips of Quercus acutissima were used as feedstock and 1.7 g/L of ethanol was produced after 96 h of fermentation in the SHF process, while in the SSF process 1.5 g/L of ethanol was obtained after 144h (SASAKI et al., 2014) . C. phytofermentans was used in a CBP configuration with corn stover as feedstock. An ammonia fiber expansion (AFEX) pretreatment process was conducted and 7g/L of ethanol was produced after 264h of fermentation (JIN et Another way to transform the lignocellulosic biomass into ethanol is the hybrid technology that involves thermochemical and biochemical steps, known as syngas fermentation (KHANNA; GOYAL; MOHOLKAR, 2013) , as already mentioned in the feedstock section. In addition to the syngas produced from gasification of biomass, industrial waste gas streams containing CO, H 2, and CO 2 can also be converted to ethanol by Clostridiu m species, in the biochemical step (DEVARAPALLI; ATIYEH, 2015) . The main advantage of the syngas fermentation process is that all components", "Chapter 2 of lignocellulosic material, including lignin, are converted into syngas and later fermented, overcoming the recalcitrant characteri stic of this biomass and eliminating the elevated costs related to the enzymatic pretreatment step (SHEN et al., 2015) . In 2014, it was reported that 24 g/L of ethanol was obtained from syngas fermentation (50% CO, 30% H 2, and 20% CO 2) by C. carboxidivorans P7 in a hollow fi ber membrane biofilm reactor (HFM -BR)(SHEN; BROWN; WEN, 2014a) . Richter et al. (2013) reported a two -stage syngas fermentation process by C. ljunghdalli ERI -2, operating one bioreactor for cell growth and a bubble column bioreactor equipped with a cell recycle module for ethanol production. Syngas containing 60% CO, 35% H 2, and 5% CO 2 was used, and 18 g/L of ethanol was obtained, with a productivity of 0.37 g/L.h. A study carr ied out recently with C. carboxidivorans P7 reported an ethanol productivity of 0.28 g/L.h with a syngas composition of 20% CO, 5% H 2, 15% CO 2, and 60% N 2, in a horizontal rotating packed bed biofilm reactor (h -RPB). Seven grams per liter of ethanol were o btained using the h -RPB reactor, which was 3.3 times higher than that obtained in a CSTR (continuous stirred tank reactor) under the same conditions (SHEN; BROWN; W EN, 2017) .", "7.2 Butanol", "Butanol (butyl alcohol) is a four -carbon alcohol with the molecular formula C4H9OH. It is a volatile, biodegradable, low -toxicity, flammable, and colorless liquid at ambient temperature. There are four isomeric structures of butanol: n-butanol, sec - butanol, isobutanol, and tert -butanol. This alcohol is an important building block for the chemical industry, being used as an intermediate to the production of methacrylate esters, butyl acrylate, butyl glycol ether, butyl acetate, and plas ticizers. It can also be used as a diluent for brake fluid formulation, and for the production of antibiotics, vitamins, and hormones (LEE et al., 2008; QURESHI; BLASCHEK, 2001) . One of the most important applications of butanol is as a direct replacement of gasoline or as a fuel additive, due to the low vapor pressure and cor rosivity, which allows its transportation and storage in the same infrastructure existing for gasoline, as well as its blend with existing gasoline at much higher proportions than ethanol (JIN et al., 2011; LEE et al., 2008) . Furthermore, as butanol is a four -carbon alcohol, it has the double carbon content of ethanol and contains 25% more energy (LEE et al., 2008) .", "Chapter 2 These advantages make butanol outstrip ethanol as an alternative biofuel (ZHENG et Butanol has been traditionally produced by anaerobic fermentation of sugar -rich substrates using Clostridium sp. via ABE fermentation process. With the emergence of the petrochemical industry in the 1950s, most butanol in the world started to be produced f rom fossil oil, through the hydroformylation of propene, a process known as oxo synthesis (QURESHI; BLASCHEK, 2001) . In the 1970s, the global energy crisis rekindled the worldwide focus towards development of alternative fuels , reigniting interest in ABE fermentation (NICOLAOU; GAIDA; PAPOUTSAKIS, 2010; QURESHI; BLASCHEK, 2001) . The fermentation technology of butanol production by Clostridium sp. has some drawbacks, such as the relatively high substrate cost arising from the use of edible biom ass, the low final butanol concentration obtained (less than 20 g/L), the low butanol selectivity, the low volumetric butanol productivity (less than 0.5 g/L.h), and the high cost of recovery. Thus, butanol fermentation is less competitive than that of oth er biofuels (ZHENG et al., 2015) . Aiming at overcoming these disadvantages related to the fermentation technology, some studies reported the development of genetically engineered strains to improve butanol yield , different modes of operation to increase the productivity, different recovery processes, and the use of non -edible feedstocks focusing on residual biomass (ZHENG et al., 2015) .", "Lignocellulosic biomass, syngas, molasses, and glycerol are promising feedstocks for ABE fermentation. Qureshi et al (2014) achieved 34.77 g/L of butanol using corn stover hydrolysate, and 30.86 g/L using barley straw hydrolysate, as substrates in the fermentation process by C. beijerinc kii P260, with simultaneous product recovery. Using crude glycerol (50 g/L) as a substrate, butanol production of 8.95 g/L was reported in a batch fermentation with C. pasteurianum DSM 525, and 0.119 g/L.h of productivity was achieved (GALLARDO; ALVES; RODRIGUES, 2014) . A fibrous bed reactor with gas stripping recovery was used to produce butanol with cassava bagasse hydrolysate by a hyper -butanol -producing C. acetobutylicum strain (JB200). More than 76 g/L of butanol was obtained with a productivity of 0.32 g/L.h (LU et al., 2012) . Only 1 g/L of butanol and 3 g/L of ethanol were produced after 600 h in batch fermentation (70% CO, 20% H 2, 10% CO 2) using C. carboxidivorans P7 (PHILLIPS et al., 2015) .", "Chapter 2 Mutagenesis and metabolic engineering techniques have been used to develop new strains capable of p roducing butanol in adverse situations that the wild strain could not. Zhang et al. (2017) achieved a butanol productivity of 0.53 g/L.h using a metabolically engineered strain of C. tyrobutyricum to ferment sugar cane juice, with corn steep liquor as the nitrogen source, using a fibrous bed bioreactor (FBB) in a repeated batch mode for 10 consecutive cycles in 10 days. A butanol concentration of 12.8 g/L was detected (LU et al., 2012) . Lee et al. (2016) reported the development o f a metabolically engineered strain of C. acetobutylicum that produced 44.6 g/L of butanol. Glucose was used as the substrate in a continuous fermentative process, and in situ adsorptive recovery of butanol. A butanol productivity of 2.64 g/L.h was reporte d, which represents a high value compared to similar studies.", "Different fermentation techniques can be adopted in the ABE process, including: batch, fed -batch, semi -continuous, free cell continuous, immobilized cell continuous, cell recycle cell, biofilm r eactor, fed -batch extractive fermentation, and fed -back with in situ product recovery. The batch process is the most reported due to the low contamination risk and simple operation, but a maximum ABE solvent concentration of 25-30 g/L has been obtained (PHILLIPS et al., 2015) . Zhang et al. (2017) reported an immobilized cell fermentation system with co -culturing of C. beijerinkii and C. tyrobutyricum , using hydrolysate cassava bagasse as feedstock. More than 13 g/L of butanol was produced with a productivity of 0.44 g/L.h.", "Obstacles such as the low productivity, low yield, and low substrate consumption are a result of solvent accumulation that causes severe inhibition. Efficient recovery processes are able to overcome these drawbacks, but usually lead to high processing cost an d to large quantities of disposal water. The most -used recovery technique in the industry is conventional distillation, but other techniques have been investigated in order to reduce costs, enhance productivity, eliminate inhibition effects, and increase s ugar consumption. Among these, liquid –liquid extraction, pervaporation, gas stripping, perstraction, reverse osmosis, ionic liquid extraction, adsorption, and aqueous two -phase separation can be highlighted (MAITI et al., 2016) . A very recent study reported a two -stage fed -batch fermentation of glucose by C. acetobutylicum MTC11274 with magnesium limitation and calcium supplementation, integrated to a gas stripping system. More than 54 g/L of butanol was detected, with a productivity of 0.58 g/L.h (AHLAWAT et al., 2018) . Dong et al.", "Chapter 2 (2014) reported a ceramic hollow fiber -supported polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) composite membrane used for the pervaporation of butanol. The results sh owed the PDMS composite membrane exhibited high and stable performance for butanol recovery from ABE systems. Raganati et al. (2018) showed an efficient recovery of butanol from ABE fermentation broth by adsorption on Amberlite XAD -7, as this adsorbent pre sents high affinity for butanol and poor affinity for glucose.", "7.3 Acetone", "Acetone, also known as propanone, is a colorless, volatile, flammable, and toxic liquid. Represented by the chemical formula (CH 3)2CO, it is the simplest, smallest, and commercially most -important aliphatic ketone. Almost 7 million tons of acetone are produced globally per year (RESEARCH&MARKET, 2018) . The development of acetone industrial production by fermentation was promoted by the outbreak of the First World War. The Weismann proces s was patented in March 1915. The main objective to produce acetone by this time was the conversion into cordite, a smokeless ammunition powder (BRANDUARDI; SAUER, 2018; JON ES; WOODS, 1986) . However, in the 1950s, routes to produce solvents from oil were made cost -competitive with fermentation. Furthermore, the major feedstock for fermentation processes was molasses, which spiked in price because of animal feed demand. Tod ay, approximately 100 years after the publication of the Weizmann process, its modern approachesare gaining interest once more, with a different driver, namely, the search for more sustainable processes (BRANDUARDI; SAUER, 2018) .", "At present, the global acetone industry is driven by the solvents sector, representing approximately 34% of global demand in 2017. As a solvent, it is used in products, such as nail polish removers, cement, lacquers, cleaners, paint, coatings, films, and adhesives (WEN et al., 2019) . It is also used for MMA (methyl methacrylate) production, to form PMMA (polymethyl methacrylate), and as a fuel additive (HIS Acetone can be produced through different methods, such as the cumene process, from alkane nitriles, hydrolysis of gem -dihalides, dehydrogena tion of isopropyl alcohol, ozonolysis of alkanes, and the fermentation process. About 96% of the world‘s acetone production is as a by -product of phenol by the cumene process, which uses benzene and propylene, two petrochemical products, as raw materials", "Chapter 2 (RESEARCH&MARKET, 2018) . Integrated metabolic and evolu tionary engineering was applied to C. cellulovorans and a 138 -fold increase in butanol production was achieved (SREEKUMAR et al., 2015) . Due to the current concern about greenhouse gas emissions and the replacem ent of petrochemical processing by renewable processes and feedstocks, fermentation technologies are of interest to academic and industrial communities (HIS MARKIT, 2019) .", "The fermentation of sugar using Clostridium strains i s a well -known industrial process, for which main products are acetone, butanol, and ethanol (ABE), obtained in a molar ratio of 3:6:1 (HIS MARKIT, 2019) . Strictly anaerobic Gram -positive microorganisms possess a fermentation metabolism and utilize a variety of sugars, oligosaccharides, and polysaccharides by two distinct phases, acidogenic and solventogenic (MILLAT; WINZER, 2017) . Usually, desired products of ABE fermentation are butanol and ethanol; acetone is the major by -product and is produced in the solventogenic phase, along with ethanol and butanol (HIS MARKIT, 2019) . Glucose is the preferred substrate for ABE fermentation; however, a range of substrates can be used, such as simple sugars (galactose and xylose), disac charides (maltose, sucrose, and lactose) and complex polysaccharides (cellulose and hemicellulose). Furthermore, direct conversion of starch without any hydrolysis step is possible with Clostridium strains (HIS MARKIT, 2019) .", "The most widely used species for the production of acetone is C.", "acetobutylicum , although C. beijerinkii has also been used with good results. Li, Shi and Li, (2014) reported a fermentation process in a 7L bioreactor with C. acetobutylicum ATCC824, using a cassava -based medium. Six grams per liter of acetone were produced after 50h of fermentation. The addition of acetate in the culture medium is a new approach to inc rease acetone and butanol production in ABE fermentation (BOONSOMBUTI et al., 2014) . Acetone production doubled with the addition of 4 g/L of acetate in the culture medium containing 50 g/L of glucose wit h C. saccharoperbutylacetonicum N1-4 fermentation. For pretreated corncob fermentation by C. beijerinkii TISTR1461, an inferior increase (8%) was detected with acetate addition fermentation (BOONSOMBUTI et a l., 2014) .", "Batch is the most common operational process for ABE studies, despite its drawbacks, such as low cell density, low reactor productivity, nutritional limitations, and severe product inhibition. An important approach that has attracted interest to achieve", "Chapter 2 greater conversion rates in ABE fermentation is cell immobilization technology. The immobilization can be done by adsorption or entrapment, but due to diffusion limitation problems, passive adhesion to surfaces is preferred (SURVASE; VAN HEININGEN; GRANSTRÖM, 2012) . Six grams per liter of acetone was obtained as by -product with C. acetobutylicum DSM792 using glucose as a substrate in a continuous column bioreactor with wood pulp as the immo bilization material (SURVASE; VAN HEININGEN; GRANSTRÖM, 2012) . Kong et al. (2015) reported a batch fermentation using free and immobilized C. acetobutylicum XY16 with modified sugarcane bagasse as a s upport for immobilization. A 1.4 -times increase in acetone production was achieved with the cell immobilized batch process.", "7.4 1,3-propanediol 1,3-Propanediol (1,3 -PDO), also called trimethylene glycol, 1,3 - dihydroxypropane, or propylene glycol, is a three -carbon molecule with the molecular formula C 3H8O2 (TJAHJASARI; KAEDING; ZENG, 2011) . Because of its enormous applications in the synthesis of polyesters, polyethers, polyurethanes, and heterocyclic compounds, such as indole and quinolines,1,3 -PDO is a promising bulk chemical. The chemical industry also uses 1,3 -PDO to obtain resins, engine coolants, mortars, and inks (SELEMBO et al., 2009) . The most important application involves the synthesis of a superior polymer known as polytrimethylene terephthalate (PTT). PTT is a biode gradable polyester with great potential application in textile, carpet, and upholstery manufacturing. Compared to other similar polymers, such as polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polybutylene terephthalate (PBT), or nylon, PTT has better elasticity and be tter modulus. It shows higher ultraviolet (UV) resistance and tends less to electrostatic charging (SUN et al., 2014; TJAHJASARI; KAEDING; ZENG, 2011) . A number of different chemical and fermentative routes can be used to synthesize 1,3 -PDO. The chemical routes to produce 1,3 -PDO are hydration of acrolein, followed by hydroformylation and hydrogenation of ethylene oxide. These processes require expensive catalysts, high temperature, and pressure, with several disadvantages, such as toxic intermediates and non -renewable raw materials (SUN et al., 2014; TJAHJASARI; KAEDING; ZENG, 2011) . Alternative fermentative routes are more environmentally friendly compared to chemical pro cesses. Glycerol is the unique substrate that can be directly metabolized to 1,3 -PDO. Native microorganisms that", "Chapter 2 convert glycerol into 1,3 -PDO belong mainly to the genera Clostridium, Klebsiella, Citrobacter, Enterobacter and Lactobacillus . All are able to produce 1,3 -PDO using glycerol as the sole carbon source except Lactobacillus , which produces 1,3 -PDO by co-fermentation using both sugar and glycerol as substrates simultaneously (TJAHJASARI; KAEDING; ZENG, 2011) . Among these microorganisms, K. pneumoniae and C. butyricum have been most intensively studied due to their substrate tolerance, high yield, and productivity. Although C. butyr icum is strictly anaerobic and K. pneumonia is facultative anaerobic, C. butyricum is more interesting for industrial application because K. pneumonia is classified as an opportunistic pathogen (ZHUGE et al., 2010) . Another possibility of producing 1,3 -PDO involves genetical ly engineered strains that can utilize sugar to glycerol and glycerol to 1,3 -PDO consecutively (SUN et al., 2014; TJAHJASARI; KAEDING; ZENG, 2011; ZHUGE et Many strategies have been investigated to increase yield and productivity of 1,3 - PDO using Clostridium strains, including by -product reduction; substrate and product inhibition reduction; different bioreactor operation modes; mutagenesis an d genetic modification of strains; cell immobilization; and co -culture fermentation (JENSEN et al., 2012; LEE et al., 2015; ZENG , 1996) .

Another relevant application of butyric acid is butanol production by either biotransformation using microorganisms or catalytic chemical process (LUO et al., 2018) . At present, butanol is mainly produced by the petrochemical industry via oxidation of butyraldehyde obtained from oxosynthesis of propylene (LUO et al., 2018; YANG; et al., 2013) . However, concerns regarding environmental impacts and the rising desire to use renewable resources have driven industrial attention toward fermentative production of butyric acid, especially for applications in the food and pharmaceutical industries (WANG et al., 2016; YANG; et al., 2013) .", "Although butyric acid can be synthesized by various strains belonging to the genera of Clostridium , Butyrivibrio , Butyribacter ium, Sarcina , Eubacterium , Fusobacterium , Megasphaera , Roseburia ,and Coprococcus (LUO et al., 2018; YANG; et al., 2013) , the preferred strains for potential commercial uses are from the genus Clostridium because of their higher and stable productivity and production titers (SAINI et al., 2017; YA NG; et al., 2013) . Most butyric acid -producing Clostridia ferment glucose, xylose, lactose, starch, and glycerol for cell growth and butyric acid production. Cellulose and CO 2 can also be converted into butyrate by some species (WANG et al., 2016; YANG; et al., 2013) . C. carboxidivorans can utilize CO, CO 2, and H2 to produce butyric acid . C. cellulovorans, C.polysaccharolyticum , and C.populeti can use cellulose for butyrate synthesis (YANG; et al., 2013) . Some Clostridium", "Chapter 2 species can be manipulated to produce either solvents or acids as the main products, depending on culture conditions. Several species, including C. butyricum , C. tyrobutyricum , and C. thermobutyricum produce butyrate as the main product with a relatively high productivity and yield; thus, they are the most studied species due to their high commercial potential for butyric acid production. C. kluyveri can produce butyric acid as a major product from et hanol and acetate as substrates; however, n- caproic acid is produced instead of butyrate when ethanol is present in excess of acetate (LUO et al., 2018; YANG; et al., 2013) .", "n-Caproic acid, a six -carbon chain carboxylic acid, is a versatile platform chemical for producing flavor additives for the food industry and biofuels for aviation. This m olecule is also a potential antimicrobial agent that can be used as a green antibiotic (AGLER et al., 2014; CAVALCANTE e t al., 2017) . n-Caproic acid is produced by chain elongation of a carboxylic acid, which is a reversed β-oxidation pathway using ethanol or lactic acid as an electron donor. Short -chain carboxylic acids are elongated by adding two carbons (acetyl -CoA derived from ethanol) each time, converting them into chemicals with six or more carbons (AGLER et al., 2014; ZHU et al., 2017) . C. kluyveri and Clostridium sp. BS -1 were identified as n-caproic acid producers (CAVALCANTE et al., 2017) . The use of C. kluyveri pure culture was reported in the caprogenic processes, but open cultures are known to increase metabolite production. Studies have used different substrates, such as acetic acid with ethanol, syngas fermentation effluent with ethanol, yeast -fermentation beer, and lactic acid (CAVALCANTE et al., 2017; GE et al., 2015) .", "Another valuable organic molecule that can be obtained by Clostridium anaerobic fermentation is isopropanol, also called isopropyl alcohol. Isopropanol i s an important organic solvent used in paints and varnishes, removers, antiseptic solutions, printing, perfumery, and cosmetics (YANG et a l., 2016) . This molecule is also an additive for gasoline and diesel, and an important precursor for the production of green propylene (LIU et al., 2019) .", "Although ABE fermentations are usually conducted using C. acetobutylicum , several C. beijerinckii sp., having an additional primary/secondary alcohol dehydrogenase, can convert acetone to isopropanol. Studies using C. beijerinckii have reported mainly butanol and isopropanol production with very little ethanol/acetone,", "Chapter 2 YANG, T. C. et al.

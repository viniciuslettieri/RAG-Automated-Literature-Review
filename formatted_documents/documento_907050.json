Principal -Agent Theory states that better firm performance is related to a significant relation with executive remuneration and executive turnover, the former positive and the latter negative . Empirical studies developed in a international context and in Brazil in the last decades are inconclusive over that, so this paper is going to contribute adding new data to the discussion . The results show a performance measured by ROA, ROE and Dividen d Yield not related with executive remuneration and executive turnover, except : ROA and remuneration. This issue is relevant as Agent -Principal Theory is one of the most popular inside corporative governance field and many corporate practices are based on its premises. Therefore, more studies about it benefit top management teams and regulators that promote more efficiency in economy. As an impact on the area, this article introduces 2018 data in the discussion and relates for the first time in Brazil B oard of Directors turnover with firm performance. The analysis is based on 100 companies selected from Bovespa and as already mentioned the proxy for their performance is ROA, ROE and Dividend Yield, which were calculated using their financial demonstrati ons, while remuneration and turnover data were collected from Comissão de Valores Mobiliários (CVM). Due its panel format, the method used was Fixed Effects, with special attention to problems that usually happen in the process and can invalidate it, as he teroskedasticity and autocorrelation .", "Keywords: agency principal theory; executive remuneration; executive turnover; firm performance; Brazil ; Corporative Governance", "List of Tables", "Sum mary", "1. Intr oduction", "Executive remuneration and its relation with firm performance has been a relevant issue for business researchers for decades. Nevertheless, the results are not conclusive as empirical studies have different conclusions and many researches face difficulties due to a lack of reliable data for ana lysis. The link between executive turnover and performance has been studied as well for many years, but unlike the former, its results are more consistent. In Brazil , both topics are relatively new, because more detailed information about executive remune ration was not easily available in quantity and quality until 2009, when CVM developed a regulation called Instruction 480 that created mandatory disclosure data regarding those issues. This paper provides the following contributions to the literature. I t is the first study to update Brazilian remuneration -performance data and analyze the relation between executive turnover and firm performance up to 2018. Moreover, this study extends the analysis not only to C -level executives but also evaluates board o f director turnover and its sensibility to performance. Finally, we estimate in the same equation the relation between firm performance using both executive remuneration and turnover.", "The theoretical context for most research on executive compensation is the agency theory, which states that there is a challenge in aligning management interests with those from equity owners. A symbol of it would be the Enron Case, when managers fooled equity owners. Their actions were conscientiously not maximizing shareho lder value in a sustainable manner, but otherwise enrich themselves in short - term with accounting demonstration fraud. And they were successful for years. Executive remuneration is central for agency theory because companies have been understood for many years that one part of the solution for it is the “optimal contract approaching”, which states that aligning remuneration with performance helps solving the problem at a considerable low cost. This subject has been tested during years and empirical works c ontinue to be done because no consensus was achieved Other relevant issue for business researches that is linked with agency theory is executive turnover. In a scenario of information asymmetr y the most objective way", "for shareholders to control the board of directors and management team alignment to their best interests is through performance. If the company has good figures achieved through sustainable operations the two groups are aligned, o therwise not. So, higher executive turnover is expected with underperformance and lower turnover is expected with overperformance.", "There are many studies investigating the relationship between executive compensation, turnover and performance, mostly focu sing on CEOs and the board of directors. In general, the papers indicate there is a significant relationship between firm performance and executive turnover.", "Using the new data available for research in Brazil following CVM Instruction 480, we study the 100 largest and most liquid Brazilian listed companies from 2010 and 2018 and evaluate if there is a significant relation between firm performance and executive remuneration. We measure firm performance by return on asset (ROA), return on equity (ROE) and d ividend yield.", "Our results indicate a positive relation between variable compensation and ROA, but no significant relation between total compensation and ROA. Moreover, we document that ROE and dividend yield are not significantly related to executive compensation.", "This paper is structured in the following way. The next section presents the literature review, and Section 3 shows the data and methodology. Section 4 reports the results, whereas Section 5 concludes.", "2. Literature Review", "Modern organizations are a complex phenomenon and organizing internal resources and resolving conflicts among stakeholders (owners, managers and employees) are challenging. The corporate governance (CG) is key to reduce the conflicts among stakeholders (Daily et al., 2003). The exact definition of CG is not a consensus (Khan, 2011), but as this work is from Finance field we are going to adopt a perspective from it: “the ways in which suppliers of finance to cor porations assure themselves of getting a return on their investment” (Shleifer and Vishny,1997).", "Starting from the premise established by Berle and Means (1932) that ownership is separated from control many theories describe the consequences of it and ho w to neutralize possible problems and optimize performance. There are many theories on this topic: agency theory (Daily et al. , 2003) , stewardship (Donaldson and Davis, 1991), resource dependency (Pfeffer and Salancik, 1978), and so on. Some theories state that executives are somehow aligned with shareholders so actually the problem of separated ownership and control is mitigated, while others say that the goals are different and the problem is serious and must be faced.In the first group , Stewardship states that executives have aligned goals with shareholders, that is, they are satisfied and motivated when organizational success is achieved. Likewise, resource dependency proposes a positive view about executives, specifically the board of directors. In short, many important resources for the company are obtained by them . Agency theory is in the second group, so is structured based on conflict . Specifically between the principal and agent. In a public company the shareholder is the princip al and the agent is the manager. The former hires the latter to act in his best interests, but the agent has his own motivations and there is no guarantee that he will do that. Shareholder has a difficult time trying to oversee everyday performance due to lack of information and time (Jensen and Meckling, 1976).", "Although there are other explanations for companies dynamics, according to Daily et al. (2003), agency theory is prominent for two reasons: 1) it is a simple theory, in which dynamics are reduced to two actors with predictable behavior, and 2) the", "premise of the self -interested man is in economists minds since Adam Smith launched the idea 200 years ago.", "Many instruments based on the agency theory were developed and are being used nowadays: executive remuneration associated to financial and stock market performance (Jensen and Meckling, 1976), board of directors composed with independent di rectors (Rosenstein and Wyatt, 1990), information systems for controlling internal operations (Eisenhardt , 1989), etc During the last two decades there was a stronger push to implement these practices, as corporate scandals contributed to increase percep tion of a necessity of better corporate governance mechanisms (Blanes, Fuentes and Porcuna , 2019), a change in shareholders behavior as their activism increases (Minton and Kaplan, 2012), etc. Nevertheless, the task of developing good corporate governance apparently is simpler in some countries because the difference between ownership and control is less significant, naturally leading to a superior alignment between principa l and agent. As his profits/losses are maximized in this scenario, the cost of effectively overseeing operations is largely surpassed by the benefits (Ozkan, 2011). In this context, executive remuneration may be a important instrument to align interest am ong stakeholders. The link with agency theory is straightforward: remuneration should be closely related to performance. There are two ways of the principal oversee an agent: by his behavior or his results (Bebchuk and Fried, 2003). Among other reasons, the first one is expensive because of information asymmetry. How to control every step managers do in their work? So, the control is through results assessment and the materialization is remuneration being a direct proportion of it (Bebchuk and Fried, 20 03).", "Many papers had addressed this issue, but there is no consensus on the conclusions. Some studies found significant relationship between executive compensation and performance, but other papers find opposite results (Blanes, Fuentes and Porcuna, 201 9).First, data available in different time -period and country vary significantly. In Brazil, for example, variable remuneration (an important component for understanding the issue) was not mandatory for public companies until 2009. And many companies went to court for not disclosing this information in the", "immediately following years. So, this valuable kind of data will be available in a larger quantity only in some years from now.", "Second, agency theory related problems are less intense in some countries than in others (Ozkan 2011). So, the remuneration solution tends to be less applied according to the agency theory. This is the case of European and Asian countries (Coffee, 1999). The US and UK, on the other hand, are in the opposite side, with more fragme nted ownership, so owners tend to spend less time monitoring each company of their portfolio (Coffee, 1999).", "Third, at the same time that remuneration is a solution for agency problem as stated by “optimal contracting”, where boards would structure the op timal remuneration systems for executives, some researchers says that executive remuneration is part of the problem itself, the so called “managerial power approach”, which the board would favor executives for several reasons for their own benefit (Bebchuk and Fried, 2003). For example, the CEO has a say when to reconduct a board member for another tenure. So, the board member would not like to vote against him, but otherwise, favor In some companies the CEO can be more influential and neutralize the remuneration solution. In sum, these are causes for a predictable divergence among results throughout time and regions. Most studies correlating executive remuneration and company perform ance do not focus on C -level executives group as a whole, but instead on the CEO.", "Blanes, Fuentes and Porcuna (2019) found that there is positive relation as prescribed by agency theory, however it is also said that firm size is still the main driver of it. Nowlad (2020) shows that there is a positive relationship between executive compensation and firm performance in Indonesia, but it is conditioned by the existence of a remuneration committee. In an older study, Barkema (1998) claimed that all studies p rior to that time failed to find robust relationship between executive compensation and firm performance.", "In Brazil, Chien and Silva (2013) found no significant relationship between executive remuneration and firm performance. Konraht et al. (2016) stated there is no relationship between variable remuneration and performance. Leão (2017) reports no", "economic association between executive remuneration and firm performance. Silva et al. (2018) found no correlation between C -level executive s and performance. Souza (2019) documents that there is no relation between executive remuneration and performance.", "In this paper, we also address the executive turnover and its relation with firm performance. In the same way executive remuneration can c ontrol results, so is the risk of being fired (Coffee, 1999 ; Yamack, 2004). Most papers show that there is a significant relationship between executive turnover and firm performance. Many studies focus on CEO turnover sensitivity to performance and many show strong negative correlation between turnover and firm performance (Huson et al, 2001 ; Tsai et al . , 2006). Independent remuneration committees were found to improve this sensibility (Guo and Masulis, 2015). Other studies state that there is a surge in the relation between executive turnover and firm performance in recent years (Kaplan and There are many studies on board of directors as well (Easterwood, Ince and Raheja, 2012). Similar to CEO turnover, board of director turnover is als o sensitive to remuneration. Bates, Becher and Wilson (2015) state that board of director turnover increases due to firm performance. Gonzalez et al. , (2019) show that the involvement of family in management, ownership and on the board lead to lower sensi tivity between turnover and performance. This result is interesting for Brazil, which has a great proportion of family companies (Oro, Beuren and Hein, 2009).", "In Brazil some studies evaluate executive turnover and firm performance. Silva and Moraes (2004) find no significant relation between C -level executive turnover and firm performance. Silva and Moraes (2006) find opposite results later and report a significant relationship between turnover and performance. Garcia, Gomes and Monte (2015) state t hat CEO turnover did not influence firm performance. Matos and Coloauto (2017) show that CEO changes increase due to performance (Kaplan and Minton,", "3.

Conclusi on", "This paper evaluates if executive remuneration is related to firm performance. Our analysis of 100 Brazilian companies from 2010 to 2018 shows there is a positive relation between variable executive compensation and ROA. In contrast, there is no significant relation between total remuneration and ROA. We also find that dividend yield and ROE are not significantly related to executive compensation and turnover. It is important to highlight the main limitations of this study. Our sample contains the 100 biggest and mos t liquid companies in the Brazilian stock market. Due to their size,it is possible that those companies are the ones that pay higher remuneration to their executives, so our results may overestimate total executive compensation in Brazil. On the other hand , our sample does not contain companies that do not publish executive compensation. If one assumes that the firms not disclosing information pay higher remuneration to their executives, our sample may underestimate total executive compensation in Brazil. T hese two limitations have opposite effects, which may offset or at least be mitigated Many stakeholders may be interested in the results of this paper. Big companies in Brazil can use it as an input for improving executive remuneration and turnover. Those topics are very important, so firms must gather all information available to assess them. The regulators can also stimulate the adoption of best practices regarding executive remuneration and turnover.", "Considering how relevant is the issue of this paper and the inconclusive results in the international and national literature about the topic we suggest more research on executive compensation and turnover in Brazil. Our database is still short -dated, because the disclosure of information is mandatory in Brazil only after 2009. In the future more data will be available and will allow academic researchers to extend and perform additional analyses.", "One lin e of research would be using other dependent variable for measuring firm performance, such as Price/Earnings, Price/Book Value, Price/Sales, among others. Other line would be exploring more independent variables, like different types of executive compensat ion (bonus, stocks, stock options, incentives for short -term and", "long-term, etc). Finally, future research may evaluate how individual characteristics of executives (age, experience, gender, education, etc) and the nature of the controlling shareholder (State, family, and foreigner) influence the relationship between firm performance and executive compensation and turnover", "6.

Within this group, we find the hoarding disorder ( HD), which is characterized by the persistent difficulty in discarding or disposing of belongings, regardless of their value, due to a strong perception of the need to keep them and the suffering in disca rding them. HD often determines worse levels of quality of life, with high rates of psychiatric comorbidities, such as depression and anxiety, and clinical conditions, such as cardiovascular and sleep- related diseases. Our objective in this dissertation is to discuss aspects of lifestyle in individuals with OCRD , with an emphasis on HD, and, therefore, we review the literature on six relevant lifestyle domains : smoking, ingestion of alcohol, regular physical activity, obesity, sleep disorders and history of traumatic events. Our study was developed through two articles, the first being entitled “Is There A Role For Lifestyle Interventions In Obsessive -Compulsive A nd Related Disorders?”, a narrat ive review of the lifestyle domains , showing, in psychobiological terms, the potential value of interventions in these domains in individuals with OCRD . In addition, we show data that confirm the presence of these harmful be haviors in this population and evidence of modification in these lifestyle domains, generating better results. In the second article, “Exploring the Determinants of Unhealthy Lifestyle in People with Problematic Hoarding Behaviors”, 114 participants with symptoms of hoarding (scores on the Saving Inventory- Revised > or = 39) were evaluated in an onl ine survey using these questionnaires : The Obsessive -Compulsive and Related Disorders Traumatic and Stressful Life Events Scale, hoarding version (OTRAS -HV), The General Self - Efficacy Scale (GSES), The Internalized Stigma of Mental Illness Inventory -10 (ISMI - 10) and FANTASTIC Lifestyle Checklist (FANTASTIC). The latter is divided into three sub -scores:", "“problematic health behaviors”, “positive life investments” a nd “poor emotional regulation”. A linear regression demonstrated a worse lifestyle among individuals with problematic hoarding behaviors who described a greater number of traumatic events throughout their lives, greater internalized stigma and reduced self -efficacy. Furthermore, longer duration of illness was associated with the lifestyle domain “problematic health behaviors”, difficult discarding and higher internalized stigma predicted worse “emotional regulation” subscores, and finally, internalized stig ma lower and higher self -efficacy were also associated with greater “positive investments in life”.", "Keywords: hoarding disorder; lifestyle; obs essive -compulsive disorder; health risk behaviors .", "SUMÁRIO", "REFERÊNCIAS 60 APÊNDICE A 70 APÊNDICE B 84", "1 MEMORIAL DA TRAJETÓRIA ACADÊMICA", "O presente memorial descreve minha trajetória acadêmica e científica como aluna do estágio probatório e do mestrado do programa de Pós -Graduação em Psiquiatria e Saúde Mental (PROPSAM) do Instituto de Psiquiatria da Universidade do Brasil (IPUB). Concluí minha graduação em Medicina pela Universidade Federal Fluminense em 2011. Em 2012 iniciei a residência médica de Clínica Médica no Hospital Universitário Antônio Pedro e em 2014, iniciei, no mesmo hospital, a residência em Psiquiatria. Na residência de Clínica Médica, pude ter contato mais próximo com o professor Leonardo Fontenelle, em seu ambulatório, o que me ajudou bastante na decisão em retomar a ideia de ser psiquiatra, um amor antigo, que , por algum tempo, foi por mim questionado. Ao final da residência, em 2017, surgiu o desejo de realizar o mestrado com o objetivo futuro de ser professora universitária. Iniciei no estágio probatório no ambulatório do IPUB de Ansiedade, Obsessões e Compulsões, coordenado pelo professor Leonardo Fontenelle e pela Gabriela Bezerra de Menezes. Em junho de 2019, de i início ao Mestrado no PROPSAM, com um projeto inicial sobre transto rnos de personalidade em pacientes com transtorno obsessivo- compulsivo e fobia socia l. Devido a pandemia, alguns planos tiveram de ser refeitos. Como sempre acreditei na importância de um olhar global sobre os pacientes psiquiátricos, passei a estudar sobre o estilo de vida em pacientes com comportamentos problemáticos de acumulação/ transtorno de acumulação, o que foi surpreendente.", "Durante quatro anos de partic ipação no ambulatório de Ansiedade, Obsessões e Compulsões e como aluna no PROPSAM , tive a oportunidade de atender muitos pacientes , aprender muito nas discussões após os atendimentos, participar de algumas pesquisas , ter aulas com professores brilhantes e o principal: valorizar cada vez mais a Ciência!", "2 INTRODUÇÃO", "O transtorno obsessivo- compulsivo (TOC) é caracterizado por pensamentos, imagens ou urgências indesejáveis e estressantes (obsessões) associados ou não a comportamentos repetitivos ou atos mentais realizados com o intuito de reduzir o estresse ou de acordo com regras rígidas pré -estabelecidas (compulsões) (APA, 2013) . Estudos de prevalência sugerem que 3,1% da população é afetada por esse transtorno, o qual causa prejuízo funcional e de qualidade de vida (FONTENELLE; MENDLOWICZ; VERSIANI, 2006; RUSCIO et al ., 2010) . A partir do Manual Diagnóstico e Estatístico de Transtornos Mentais (DSM -5), houve o surgimento da categoria transtornos relacionados ao transtorno obsessivo- compulsivo (TRTOC), incluindo tra nstorno dismórfico corporal (TDC), transtorno de acumulação (TA), tricotilomania (TTM), transtorno de escoriação (TE), transtorno obsessivo- compulsivo induzido por substância/medicamento, transtorno obsessivo- compulsivo especificado e não especificado (APA , 2013) .", "Evidências sugerem que os TRTOC (i.e TOC (COLUCCIA et al ., 2016) , TDC (PHILLIPS; KATHARINE, 2000) , TA (TOLIN et al., 2019) , TTM e TE (ODLAUG et al ., 2010) estariam relacionados à maior incapacidade e piores índices de qualidade de vida. Em uma revisão brasileira, por exemplo, observou- se que o TE estaria relacionado com pr ejuízo na qualidade de vida física e psicológica e com maiores índices de dependência de tabaco e álcool (MACHADO et al., 2018) . Além desses transtornos apresentarem elevada comorbidade com outros transtornos psiquiátricos, como depres são e ansiedade, estudos mostram que, assim como ocorre no TOC (ISOMURA et al., 2018) , no TA os pacientes teriam maior risco de doença cardiovascular e metabólica (TOLIN et al ., 2008; NUTLEY et al ., 2021) . O reconhecimento precoce de fatores de risco que p ossam comprometer não apenas a qualidade, mas também o estilo de vida desses sujeitos, poderia conferir melhor manejo do paciente por meio de uma visão global: clínica e psiquiátrica. Nesta dissertação, pretendemos realizar uma revisão da literatura relacionada ao estilo de vida nos TRTOC e conduzi r um estudo original, tendo o transtorno de acumulação como principal objeto de estudo. Para tal, adotamos uma abordagem narrativa e trouxemos dados de uma amostra de sujeitos com sintomas de acumulação avaliados por meio de questionários de autopreenchimento via internet [ Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT)].", "2.1 TRANSTORNO DE ACUMULAÇÃO", "O TA é caracterizado pela dificuldade do indivíduo em descartar ou se desfazer de objetos, independentemente do seu valor, levando à obstrução ou congestionamento de cômodos dentro de casa, acarretando sofrimen to ou comprometimento funcional (APA, 2013). Historicamente, o sintoma de acumulação costumava ser considerado parte do diagnóstico de TOC. Entretanto, estudiosos aponta ram que a acumulação parecia se constituir em uma “entidade distinta” (MATAIX -COLS et al., 2010; PERTUSA et al., 2010) por apresentar diferenças clínicas do TOC, uma vez que muitos indivíduos com acumulação excessiva não apresentava m outros sintomas obsessivo- compulsivos. Além disso, os pacientes com acumulação excessiva, quando submetidos a tratamentos indicados para o TOC [sejam eles medicamentosos (como inibidores da receptação da serotonina) ou psicológicos (exposição e prevenção de resposta)], apresenta vam pouca resposta terapêutic a (MATAIX -COLS et al., 2010) . De acordo com o DSM -5, portanto, boa parte dos quadros de acumulação excessiva foram reclassificados como uma entidade diagnóstica distinta do TOC (i.e. TA), ainda que inseridos nos transtornos relacionados ao TOC (APA, 2013) , ganhando maior notoriedade clínica.", "A etiologia do transtorno ainda é desconhecida, mas geralmente apresenta um curso leinto e progressivo. F atores genéticos parecem ter um papel importante na ocorrência do transtorno, ao lado de fatores ambientais e eventos traumáticos (IERVOLINO et al., 2009; GRISHAM et al., 2006) ). Estudos com gêmeos sugerem que até 50% da variância nos comportamentos de acumulação pode ser decorrente de fatores genéticos (IERVOLINO et al., 2009) . Modelos cognitivos do TA sugerem que essa condição é mantida por fatores como comprometimento da tomada de decisão, déficits na função cognitiva básica, desregulação emocional e intolerância, além de evitação comportamental (STEKETEE; FROST, 2003; TIMPANO et al., 2014) . Um estudo que avaliou de forma retrospectiva quatro grupos de indivíduos, dentre eles, os que apresentavam TA sem comorbidade, TA com comorbidades, TOC com sintomas de acumulação e um grupo controle, mostrou que eventos traumáticos foram mais relatados entre os acumuladores, principalmente aqueles sem sintomas obsessivo - compulsivos (LANDAU et al., 2011) . No me smo estudo, evidenciou- se uma relação entre a gravidade do transtorno e o número total de eventos traumáticos. Curiosamente, não houve aumento de transtorno do estresse pós -traumático entre os pacientes com TA comparados aos controles (LANDAU et al., 2011) .", "Estudos epidemiológicos sugeriram uma prevalência do TA entre 1,3 a 5,8% (SAMUELS et al., 2008; IERVOLINO et al., 2009; NORDSLETTEN et al., 2013 a) e uma meta -análise recente mostrou que o transtorno afeta até 2,5% da população. Nesta meta- análise, fatores como falta de insight e vergonha em revelar comportamentos de acumulação podem ter compromet ido esses dados (POSTLETHWAITE; KELLETT; MATAIX -COLS, 2019) . O início dos sintomas de acumulação geralmente se dá na infância/adolescência ( FONTENELLE, 2004), em média aos 13,4 anos de idade (GRISHAM et al., 2006) . Entretanto, a prevalência do transtorno aumenta em idosos (SAMUELS et al., 2008) , o que os torna mais expostos ao risco de quedas, contaminação de alimentos, infestação e incêndio devido aos elevados níveis de desordem no ambiente doméstico (STEKETEE; FROST, 2014) . Interessante notar que a busca por tratamento ocorre geralmente em fases mais avançadas da vida, talvez pelo baixo insight ou porque indivíduos com TA acabam sendo conduzidos ao clínico por familiares ou membros da comunidade, que somente reconhecem o problema quando já está bem avançado", "(GRISHAM et al., 2006) . Além disso, o isolamento social, característica comum entre os idosos com TA, pode dificultar o seu recrutamento (ROANE et a l., 2017) . Em relação à distribuição pelo sexo, embora estudos iniciais tenham sugerido uma tendência do TA mais comum no sexo masculino (SAMUELS et al., 2008) , esse achado não se comprovou recentemente (CATH et O TA resulta em prejuízo econôm ico substancial, e a gravidade de seus sintomas está diretamente relacionada a números de dias de trabalho perdidos (TOLIN et al., 2008; MATHES et al., 2019) . Mesmo pacientes com sintomas de acumulação subclínicos apresentam taxas de desemprego maiores do que a população geral (TOLIN et al., 2008) . Além disso, o custo médio com a limpeza de casas de indivíduos com acumulação excessiva nos Estados Unidos gira em torno de $16000 dólares, com elevada chance de recidiva do acúmulo dentro de alguns meses (TOLIN et al., 2008) . Em relação aos aspectos culturais, estudo transdiagnóstico envolvendo Reino Unido, Espanha, Japão e Brasil, mostrou uma fenomenologia similar do transtorno entre estas diferentes culturas (NORDSLETTEN et al., 2018) .", "Há diversas motivações para que o indivíduo com TA acumule, por exemplo, (1) o valor sentimental que o objeto possui (guardando- o, o indivíduo manterá a memória de pessoas e lugares); (2) o valor potencial ou a percepção de utilidade do objeto e/ou (3) o valor externo ou intrínseco do objeto (por achá- lo belo ou por ficar orgulhoso de detê -lo, o paciente decide não jogar o objeto fora) (SNOWDON, 2015) . Diante de tantas “justificativas”, a deci são de descartar objetos causa desconforto, ansiedade, tristeza e culpa nos indivíduos com acumulação (STEKETEE, 2002) .", "Esse desconforto pode se dar tanto com o descarte de objetos físicos ou", "itens digitais, como fotografias e vídeos (THORPE; BOLSTER; NEAVE, 2019) . Dentre os objetos mais acumulados, estão roupas velhas, cartas, CDs/ DVDs e revistas (NORDSLETTEN et al., 2013 b). O acúmulo digital (NEAVE et al., 2019) não causa obstrução ou desordem em cômodos, mas cursa com impacto nas funções da vida diária dos acumuladores (THORPE; BOLSTER; NEAVE, 2019) . Dentre as comorbidades psi quiátricas associadas ao TA, os transtornos mais comuns são transtorno depressivo maior (50,7%), transtorno de ansiedade generalizada (24,4%), fobia social (23,5%), transtorno de déficit de atenção e hiperatividade (30%) e pr oblemas do controle do impulso incluin do compulsão por compras (60,8%), e aquis ição de objetos aletoriamente (59,9%) e cleptomania (9,9%) . Curiosamente, o TOC (18%) não se encontra entre os transtornos comórbidos mais comuns (FROST; STEKETEE; TOLIN, 2011) . Em relação aos transtornos de personalidade, os traços de personalidade mais comuns entre os indivíduos com TA são o evitativo, o dependente, o depressivo e o esquizoide . Esta análise conduzida por Dozier e colaboradores identificaram que todos os 72 pa rticipantes de sua amostra possuíam forte apego às suas posses, e a percepção de apego com seus itens foi o principal preditor de traços de personalidade do cluster A, que são definidos por comportamentos estranhos ou excêntricos (DOZIER et al., 2020b) .", "Em relação ao tratamento psicológico, a terapia cognitiva -comportamental individual ou em grupo, com protocolo específico (MUROFF et al., 2014) para TA, apresenta a melhor resposta terapêutica (THOMPSON et al., 2017) . Uma estratégia promissora de tratamento visa à abordagem familiar dos pacientes com TA; em um estudo pilo to, observou- se que técnicas específicas podem ajudar os familiares a terem maior conhecimento do transtorno, a desenvolverem menor acomodação familiar e melhores estratégias de enfrentamento dos problemas decorrentes do transtorno (CHASSON et al., 2014) . Há poucos estudos na literatura acerca do tratamen to medicamentoso, sendo os inibidores seletivos da recaptação de serotonina (ISRS) e os inibidores da recaptação de serotonina e noradrenalina (ISRN) os mais utilizados, muito embora com respostas ainda consideradas insuficientes (SAXENA et al., 2007; SAXE NA; SUMMER, 2014) .", "Apesar da escassez de estudos, evidências iniciais sugerem que indivíduos com TA apresentam maior chance de desenvolverem comorbidades clínicas (NORDSLETTEN et al., 2013 a; AYERS et al., 2015) . Em uma entrevista de autopreenchimento com os pacientes e familiares com TA, observou -se que 2/3 dos pacientes com sintomas de acumulação possuíam pelo menos uma doença clínica crônica e grave e um risco três vezes maior de apresentar sobrepeso ou obesidade quando comparados aos seus familiares (TOLIN et al., 2008) . Dentre", "as condições clínicas mais comuns nessa população, estão doenças cardiovasculares (dentre elas, hipertensão e acidente vascular cerebral ), convulsão, apneia do sono, artrites, doenças hematológicas, dor crônica, problemas no estômago e vesícula, doenças autoimunes, síndrome da fadiga crônica e diabetes (TOLIN et al., 2008; AYERS; IQBAL; STRICKLAND, 2014; NUTLEY et al., 2021) .", "Dessa forma, além do reconhecimento do impacto social do TA, já não há dúvidas do quão perturbador ele pode ser na vida dos indivíduos com acumulação excessiva e o quanto é necessário um olhar mais cuidadoso sobre a forma como esses pacientes vivem e as possíveis consequências dos comportamentos observados no quadro, buscando estratégias mais precisas e eficazes de intervenção.", "2.2 ESTILO DE VIDA", "Há evidências consistentes que indicam que indivíduos portadores de transtornos mentais apresentam pior saúde física, menor acesso a unidades de saúde e mortalidade precoce (FIRTH et al., 2019) . Embora a contribuição do suicídio, como causa de mortalidade entre os pacientes com transtornos mentais, seja grande (WALKER; MCGEE; DRUSS, 2015) , hábitos de vida ruins também parecem acarretar redução na sobrevida desses pacientes (CORRELL et al., 2017) . Atualmente, observa -se um interesse crescente acerca do estilo de vida de pessoas com doença mental. Dados recentes evidenciam que indivíduos com esquizofrenia, transtorno bipolar, depressão, ansiedade e transtorno do estresse pós -traumático apresentam maior chance de ter alterações do sono, maiores taxas de tabagismo, alcoolismo, sedentarismo e dieta inapropriada (FIRTH et al., 2019) . Em países desenvolvidos, estudiosos vêm apontando a importância de um trabalho preventivo no sentido dos cuidados com o estilo de vida, estimulando comportamentos de vida saudávei s, com o objetivo de reduzir a incidência de transtornos mentais (TREMBLAY et al., 2016; AUSTRALIAN DEPARTAMENTO F HEALTH, 2019) . Embora os resultados promissores desse trabalho, em relação à melhora da saúde mental, tenham sido obtidos em uma população jovem (FIRTH et al., 2020) ,", "indiscutivelmente, o trabalho de prevenção e cuidado deve ser estendido a todas as faixas etárias.", "Os desafios que envolvem os estudos acerca desse tema começam por questões conceituais, havendo a necessidade, assim, de definir estilo de vida. De acordo com a Organização Mundial de Saúde (OMS), estilo de vida é “o conjunto de hábitos e costumes que são influenciados, modificados, estimulados ou inibidos pelo prolongado processo de", "socialização. Esses hábitos e costumes incluem o uso de substâncias como álcool, tabaco, café ou chá, hábitos alimentares e exercícios” (WHO, 2004) . Uma outra definição, na tentativa de sintetizar os conceitos existentes, sugere que o estilo de vida seja um padrão de comportamento ou um estilo geral de e nfrentamento, duradouro e modificável que reflete valores ou necessidades pessoais, de grupo ou culturas (FONTENELLE et al., 2018) . Na medicina, o conceito de estilo de vida e seus comportamentos associados geralmente abrange vários componentes, como tabagismo, consumo de álcool, padrão de sono, atividade física, dieta e nível de estresse, dentre outros fatores (FONTENELLE et al., 2018) . Portanto, na avaliação do estilo de vida, é fundamental reconhecer cada indivíduo como sendo único, com neces sidades exclusivas na modificação do estilo de vida, o que tende a ser desafiador. O estímulo para que estas modificações sejam feitas de forma conjunta é importante, visto que trabalham de maneira sinérgica umas às outras, havendo maior pr opensão a um res ultado positivo. Como exemplo, a interrupção do alcoolismo facilitaria a melhora da dieta e o início de práticas de atividade física, e vice- versa (ZAMAN; HANKIR; JEMNI, 201 9).", "Na Psiquiatria, o estudo aprofundado do estilo de vida torna -se primordial, visto que escolhas prejudiciais à saúde podem elevar o risco do desenvolvimento de transtornos mentais, assim como os transtornos mentais podem ter como consequência hábitos de vida não saudáveis, como o abuso de substâncias, distúrbios do sono ou sedentarismo (FONTENELLE et al., 2018) . Em ambos os casos, medidas preventivas podem ser adotadas visando à redução do impacto tanto na saúde física quanto na mental. Há diver sos instrumentos disponíveis que se propõem a auxiliar na avaliação do estilo de vida (PORTO et al., 2015) ; resultados negativos nesses instrumentos têm sido consistentemente associados à saúde cardiovascular precária em função de múltiplos mecanismos (WEI SBURGER, 2002) . Nesse sentido, um estudo sueco demonstrou que pacientes com TOC possuem 25% maior chance de desenvolverem doenças cardiovasculares quando comparados à população em geral. Nesse estudo, verificou- se risco para o desenvolvimento de tromboembolismo venoso de 48% e de insuficiência cardíaca, 37% (ISOMURA et al., 2021 ). Em análise realizada entre gêmeos, pôde observar -se uma relação entre risco cardiovascular e fatores de vida modificáveis, associação que se mostrou independente do histórico fami liar e dos aspectos genéticos, o que reforça a importância da modificação do estilo de vida nesses pacientes (ISOMURA et al., 2021) .", "2.3 ESTILO DE VIDA NO TRANSTORNO DE ACUMULAÇÃO", "Embora não tenhamos conhecimento de nenhum estudo, até o momento, que tenha avaliado de forma sistemática o estilo de vida em indivíduos com TA, evidências sugerem que os componentes individuais do estilo de vida nessa população (incluindo o tabagismo (RAINES et al., 2014) , consumo excessivo de álcool (SAMUELS et al., 2008) , sedentarismo, obesidade (TOLIN et al., 2008) , distúrbios do sono (DOZIER et al., 2020a ; MAHNKE et al., 2020), história de eventos traumáticos (LANDAU et al., 2011) e o isolamento social (incluindo o fator solidão) (DESTRÉE et al., 2020) s eriam pouco saudáveis. O aumento, por exemplo, descrito na fre quência de doenças cardiovasculares/ metabólicas em amostras de TA (NUTLEY et al., 2021) é consistente com essa hipótese. Cabe ressaltar que abordar o estilo de vida e a saúde física de maneira ampla, buscando o aumento da autoeficácia (JACKSON et al., 2007) , do apoio social (VERHEIJDEN et al., 2005) e minimizando o estigma internalizado (LINK et al., 2018) , pode ser particularm ente útil para pessoas com TA.", "Indivíduos com TA podem apresentar comprometimento funcional significativo.", "Aspectos como baixa sensação de segurança na vizinhança e percepção de ser vítima potencial de ataques e roubos, além de maiores taxas de desemprego, prejuízo nas relações sociais e pouca satisfação com a vida em geral podem estar presentes nessa população (SAXENA et al., 2011) . Especulamos que o comprometimento funcional decorrente dos sintomas pode ser particularmente prejudicial ao estilo de vida das pessoas com TA, impedindo o uso de espaços de convivência para atividades como preparar refeições, usar eletrodomésticos, comer à mesa e dormir na cama (AYERS et al., 2012) . Além disso, na tentativa de lidar com as situações indesejáveis causadas pela desordem e manter funções básicas como comer e dormir, as pessoas com acumulação podem adotar estratégias negativas, como fast fo od, álcool ou soníferos, que podem deteriorar ainda mais o estilo de vida. Diretamente relacionada ao comprometimento funcional, a qualidade de vida dos indivíduos com TA também se mostrou menor quando comparada a controles saudáveis ou até mesmo, a pacien tes com TOC sem acumulação (SAXENA et al., 2011; TOLIN et al., 2019)", ". Os prin cipais domínios afetados nessa população", "foram: funcionamento social, bem -estar emocional, limitações sociais devido a problemas emocionais, vitalidade e saúde em geral (TOLIN et al., 2019) .", "Trazendo para os dias atuais, especialistas vêm alertando para o risco de agravamento dos sintomas dos pacientes com TA durante a pandemia do SARS -CoV -2 (Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) , principalmente por serem muitas vezes “estimulados” a estocarem itens devido às medidas de isolamento social impostas como maneira de contenção", "do vírus (BANERJEE, 2020) , sendo mais um fator a contribuir para um pior estilo de vida neste momento de pande mia.", "É importante, como profissionais de saúde, que possamos sempre salientar que decisões pessoais e hábitos de saúde inadequados podem criar riscos para si, resultando em doença prematura ou mesmo morte e, que, por meio da melhoria do estilo de vida, podemos alcançar um melhor nível de saúde física e mental (WILSON; CILISKA, 1984) . Para melhor compreensão do tema, discutiremos abaixo os seis d omínios do estilo de vida em indivíduos com sintomas de acumulação e diagnóstico de TA.", "2.3.1 Tabagismo", "A elevada prevalência de uso de cigarro em indivíduos portadores de transtornos mentais é um grave problema de saúde pública, que contribui para a redução da expectativa de vida desta população (RCP, 2013) . Na literatura há apenas um estudo que avalia o tabagismo numa população com TOC, na qual havia indivíduos com e sem sintomas de acumulação. Os resultados demonstraram que 52% dos pacientes com TOC e sintomas de acumulação tinham o hábito de fumar, enquanto somente 18% dos pacientes com TOC sem sintomas de acumulação eram tabagistas. Pacientes com acumulação excessiva fu mavam uma quantidade maior de cigarros por dia, que podem ter sido consumidos para reduzir os afetos negativos resultantes da acumulação (RAINES et al., 2014) . De fato, um efeito positivo da nicotina na atenção e nas memórias de trabalho e episódica (VALENTINE; SOFUOGLU, 2017) , funções cognitivas sabidamente prejudicadas no TA (FROST; STEKETEE; TOLIN, 2011) , tem sido observado. Além disso, o tabagismo nessa população estaria mais relacionado ao hábito, do que propriamente à dependência (RAINES et", "2.3.2 Álcool", "O uso excessivo de álcool associado a outros transtornos mentais como depressão e ansiedade já está bem estabelecido (BOSCHLOO et al., 2013) . No entanto, a relação entre o transtorno por uso de álcool e o transtorno de acumulação ainda é pouco estudada. Em um grande e studo populacional, Samuels e colaboradores (2008) encontraram, dentre indivíduos com TA, uma prevalência de dependência de álcool atual (11,1%) e ao longo da vida (52%) significativamente maior do que aqueles sem o transtorno (4,8% e 19,5%, re spectivamente)", "(SAMUELS et al., 2008) . Mais recentemente, um estudo americano mostrou uma elevada relação entre acumulação e uso de álcool, independentemente de sintomas de ansiedade ou depressão, além de uma maior correlação entre aquisições excessivas e uso do álcool. Uma das teorias para o maior uso de álcool em acumuladores seria uma dificuldade que apresentam na regulação emocional (RAINES et al., 2017) .", "Um estudo observacional que buscou comparar os perfis cognitivos e o status de acumulação de pessoas em situação de miséria doméstica grave com histórico ou não de uso indevido de álcool, mostrou que pessoas com histórico de uso indevido de álcool tinham maior probabilidade de viver na miséria, sem acumulação, em comparação com pessoas sem histórico de uso indevido de álcool. Entretanto, esse estudo apresentou diversas limitações metodológicas, como viés de memória, falta de padronização do conceito de miséria, ausência de controle sobre a quantidade de consumo de álcool e sobre a gravidade da acumulação (GLEASON et al., 2015).", "2.3.3 Atividade Física", "Surpreendentemente, poucos estudos se debruçam sobre a avaliação de indivíduos com TOC e transtornos relacionados e atividade física. Fato interessante uma vez que, dentro dessa categoria diagnóstica, podemos observar diversos padrões alterados de comportamento em relação à prática de atividade física. Por exemplo, pacientes com TOC pode m ter um padrão evitativo de se exercitarem por dificuldade de sair à rua, enquanto pacientes com transtorno dismórfico corporal podem ser aficionados à atividade física, principalmente se houver relação com dismorfia muscular (FONTENELLE et al., 2018) Um ensaio clínico controlado, que pretendeu avaliar a atividade aeróbica versus psicoeducação (incluindo nutrição, higiene do sono, cafeína, álcool, tabagismo e manejo de medicações) em pacientes com TOC resistentes a tratamento, mostrou que o g rupo que realizou atividade física apresentou melhora significativa da ansiedade e do humor após 12 semanas de intervenção (ABRANTES et al., 2018) . Não houve diferença entre os grupos em relação às obsessões. Curiosamente, as compulsões apresentaram uma re dução importante logo após a sessão de exercício físico, ou seja, uma resposta aguda ao exercício, o que poderia ser utilizado como manejo de controle dos sintomas compulsivos. Em relação ao TA, não há na literatura estudos que avaliem a associação entre sintomas de acumulação e atividades físicas, apontando a relevância do tema para futuras pesquisas, por tratar -se de uma população com tendência à obesidade e problemas cardiovasculares (NUTLEY et al., 2021) .", "2.3.4 Obesidade", "A associação entre condições metabólicas e psiquiátricas incluindo diversos transtornos mentais, como transtorno bipolar, depressão, esquizofrenia, ansiedade, transtorno de déficit de atenção/ hiperatividade e transtorno do espectro autista, sugere uma provável relação bidirecional influenciada por uma variedade de fatores biológicos, psicológicos e sociais (NOUSEN; FRANCO; SULLIVAN, 2013) . Relação semelhante parece ser observada em indivíduos com TA.", "Um estudo recente demonstrou elevada prevalência de doenças cardiometabólicas, dor e alterações do sono em pacientes com TA. Além disso, foi encontrada correlação direta entre gravidade dos sintomas do TA e aumento das comorbidades clínicas, sendo essa correlação já presente em indivíduos com TA subclínico. Uma das hipóteses para o aumento do risco de doenças orgânicas em acumuladores seria o grave comprometimento funcional e a busca reduzida por acompanhamento mé dico (NUTLEY et al., 2021) . Essa população apresenta maior taxa de sobrepeso e obesidade (TOLIN et al., 2008) , sendo descritas em 30,7% dos indivíduos com TA subclínico e 40,4% dos indivíduos com diagnósticos de TA (NUTLEY et al., 2021) . Uma possível e xplicação genética para a obesidade no TA seria uma variação no gene do brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) - genótipo Val/Val. Em estudo avaliando a frequência genotípica do gene BDNF, 301 indivíduos com TOC foram subdivididos em dois grupos: com e s em sintomas de acumulação. Observou -se maior relação do genótipo Val/Val entre os indivíduos com acumulação, além de maior gravidade dos sintomas de acumulação entre indivíduos com TOC e maiores índices de massa corporal (IMC) (TIMPANO et al., 2011) .", "Dificuldade para dormir é uma queixa frequente na população geral. Recentemente, alguns estudos avaliando o sono em pacientes com TA têm sido publicados, no entanto, o número reduzido de participantes, geralmente insuficiente para análises estatís ticas robustas, ainda é um fator limitante. No primeiro estudo conduzido em paciente com TA (n=24), constatou- se que havia uma relação de perturbação do sono e gravidade do acúmulo. Dentre os sintomas de acumulação, principalmente adquirir e descartar obje tos se associaram ao aumento de distúrbios do sono. Uma hipótese seria que as alterações do sono, por afetarem as habilidades de tomada de decisão, contribuiriam para a faceta do TA relacionada a adquirir e dificuldade em descartar, e não a de desordem (RAINES et al., 2015) .", "Dozier et al mostrou, em 2020, correlação entre pior qualidade do sono (e não insônia) e maior gravidade dos sintomas de acúmulo em idosos, incluindo o nível de desordem (DOZIER et al., 2020a ). Interessante salientar que neste estu do a maioria dos indivíduos não relataram queixas de sono. Um possível motivo para a qualidade de sono ruim seria a dificuldade que os indivíduos teriam de deitar em sua própria cama em função da desordem, entretanto, ainda não há dados robusto que comprovem tal hipótese ( AYERS et al., 2012; DOZIER et al., 2020a ). Uma pesquisa recente, comparando alterações do sono em pacientes com TA, TOC e controles, mostrou que os grupos de TOC e TA relataram maior gravidade de sintomas de insônia e pior qualidade do sono em comparação com controles saudáveis. Entretanto, apenas a minoria desses grupos atendeu aos critérios de transtorno de sono (MAHNKE et al., 2020) . Isso sugere, portanto, que os médicos devem sistematicamente investigar sintomas de insônia em pacientes com TA e avaliar o impacto desses sintomas nos comportamentos de acumulação específicos, determinando a necessidade de intervenções.", "2.3.6 Eventos traumáticos", "O desejo de coletar e guardar bens para garantir a sobrevivência, por medo de escassez, é um comportamento adaptativo em animais e humanos. Entretanto, a dificuldade em desapegar desses bens pode estar relacionada a um evento traumático ao longo da vida. Indivíduos com sintomas de acumulação tendem a ter maior ocorrência de eventos traumáticos, incluindo desastres, doenças e medo d a própria morte ou de terceiros. Além disso, esses indivíduos com frequência referiram lembrar -se que, durante a infância, tiveram algum objeto descartado contra a sua vontade, o que lhes causou angústia (LANDAU et al., 2011) . Uma possível explicação é que tais eventos levariam os indivíduos a perceberem o mundo como imprevisível e incontrolável, estimulando- os a buscar segurança e conforto nos bens pessoais, por meio dos quais poderiam exercer algum grau de controle. Interessante ressaltar que parece não haver relação direta entre maior nível de acúmulo e maior sentimento de segurança com a posse do objeto (HARTL et al., 2005) . Landau e colaboradores (2011) mostrou que sintomas de início tardio se relacionaram mais significativamente com eventos traumáticos do que sintomas que se iniciaram mais precocemente. Um possível viés, nesse caso, seria o de memória (LANDAU", "2.4 O IMPACTO DO TRANSTORNO DE ACUMULAÇÃO NO ESTILO DE VIDA", "Como já descrito, o TA pode impactar negativamente a qualidade de vida do indivíduo, relacionando -se com diversos fatores como pior qualidade do sono, maior chance de tabagismo e alcoolismo, além de maior risco de obesidade. Muitos dos estudos citados avaliam indivíduos portadores do TA, de acordo com os critérios dos manuais diagnósticos, mas há também aqueles que avaliam indivíduos portadores de sintomas de acumulação. Tais sintomas podem estar presentes em outros quadros, como depressão, lesão cerebral ou demência (APA, 2013) , causando impactos específicos no estilo de vida desses pacientes.", "Conforme demonstrado anteriormente, dados sugerem que indivíduos com TOC e sintomas de acumulação apresentam pior funcionamento global e pior qualidade de vida (subjetiva e objetiva) do que indivíduos com TOC sem sintomas de acumulação (SAXENA et al., 2011) . Dentre os fatores que podem ser responsáveis pela pior qualidade de vida nesses indivíduos, encontram -se o acúmulo e desordem da casa, tornando- os, por exemplo, mais isolados por não querere m receber pessoas em sua casa (ONG et al., 2015) . De acordo com o modelo cognitivo proposto por Frost, pacientes com problemas de acumulação excessiva podem apresentar dificuldade em tomar decisões ou procrastinação, o que também pode interferir diretamente na qualidade de vida, com elevação da ansiedade causada por conflitos familiares devido à desordem, impossibilidade de concluir tarefas diárias como cozinhar ou pagar contas e até mesmo incapacidade laborativa (FROST; HARTL, 1996) .", "Múltiplos fatores psicológicos podem afetar, tanto positiva quanto negativamente, o estilo de vida dos sujeitos. Dois possíveis fatores seriam o estigma internalizado e a autoeficácia dos indivíduos com TA. Em comparação com TOC, por exemplo, pacientes com TA apresentaram maior estigma internalizado, o que poderia interferir negativamente na busca ou na continuidade do tratamento (CHASSON et al., 2018) . O estigma internalizado possui três características principais: diferença (\"Eles não são como eu\"), desdém (\"Eles são ruins”) e culpa (“Eles são responsáveis”) (CORRIGAN et al., 2015) . Quando alguma s dessas características são internalizadas pelo indivíduo, como uma condição verdadeira, torna -se autoestigma. Já a autoeficácia é uma crença de motivação teórica e empiricamente robusta que demonstrou desempenhar um papel importante na aprendizagem e no desenvolvimento de novas habilidades e conhecimentos (KLASSEN; KLASSEN, 2018) . A autoeficácia, segundo Bandura (1977) , é alimentada por quatro fontes de informação: r ealizações pessoais, observação de experiências, persuasão verbal e respostas emocionais. Realizações pessoais são as fontes de informação mais importantes para a expectativa de eficácia, pois são baseadas em experiências próprias. A", "observação de experiências refer e-se à observação de indivíduos desempenhando atividades sem consequências adversas, na expectativa de gerar no observador a crença de que ele também é capaz de realizá -las. A persuasão verbal, por sua vez, é uma estratégia amplamente utilizada, pela qual as pessoas são estimuladas a enfrentar situações que imaginavam superar suas habilidades. Por fim, as respostas emocionais a situações estressantes podem interferir na percepção de competência pessoal (BANDURA, 1977) . A percepção da autoeficácia eleva a confiança de atuação diante de uma tarefa particular envolvida, por meio da qual a pessoa forma uma ideia subjetiva de sua habilidade para reagir às demandas ambientais (BANDURA; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTH, 1986) .", "2.5 JUSTIFICATIVA", "Os TRTOC e o TA acometem parcela significativa da população podendo acarretar problemas não apenas na saúde mental, mas também na saúde física dos acometidos. A escassez de informações na literatura acerca do estilo de vida des sas populações e o possível impacto posit ivo que mudanças no estilo de vida poderiam trazer para es ses transtornos apontam, de forma inequívoca, para a relevância de nos debruçarmos sobre este tema, buscando sua melhor compreensão.

Unfortunately, the applic a- tion of these treatments in milder forms of illness and subclinical samples, which a ffect a substantial portion of the population, is not justifia ble by their costs ( e.g. cogn itive- behavioral therapy) and/or potential for side effects (serotonin -reuptake inhibitors assoc i- ated sexual side effects). As such, there is an urgent need to develop simple yet effective treatments, such as modifiable lifesty le interventions, that can be employed on a broader scale. Here, we review the current state of evidence that supports or refutes the efficacy of lifestyle approaches for OCRDs. We focus on dimensions of lifestyle that are deemed i m- portant for cardiovascul ar diseases; namely, physical activity, stress, sleep, diet and eating behaviors, alcohol consumption, and smoking. Despite the relative scarcity of well - designed randomized controlled trials targeting unhealthy life styles in OCRDs, we found meditation -based therapies and interventions focusing on elimina ting sedentarism to be promising approaches. In the future, these strat egies may represent valid alternative for subjects with subthreshold symptoms or at risk for OCRDs or other “compulsive” diso r- ders.", "Keywords: Obsessive -compulsive and related diso rders, lifestyle, diet, physical activity, stress, sm oking, alcohol", "1. INTRODUCTION", "Obsessive -compulsive disorder (OCD) is characte r- ized by persistent and disturbing thoughts, urges or i m- ages (obsessions) and/or repetitive behaviors and me n- tal acts that are performed in an attempt to reduce the resulti ng distress or according to certain rules (compu l- sions). [1] In general, OCD symptoms involve se xual/ religious or harm -related thoughts, and checking, was h- ing, or symmetry behaviors. [2] OCD is both fr equent and disabling: it affects up to 3.0% of the gen eral *Address correspondence to this author at the Rua Visconde de Pirajá, 547, 617, Ipanema, Rio de Janeiro -RJ, Br azil, CEP: 22410 - 003; Tel/Fax: + 55 -21-2239 -4919; E -mail: lfontenelle@gmail.compopulation and leads to decreased productivity and substant ial reductions in quality of life. [2] However, the impact of OCD’s constituent symptoms (obse s- sions, compulsions and related phenomena) may be greater than the one associated with the disorder per se. For instance, obsessions and compulsions are also co m- monly seen in sub -threshold yet disabling forms of the illness. [3-6] There are also unclear boundaries of OCD with other psychopathological phenomena, such as delusions, impulsive behaviors, and habits.", "In the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistic al Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM -5), OCD is at the core of a new diagnostic chapter entitled “obsessive - compulsive and related disorders” (OCRDs), which 2 Current Medicinal Chemistry, 2018 , Vol. 25, No. 00 Fontenelle et al. includes body dy smorphic disorder (BDD), hoarding disorder, trichotillomania (hair pulling disorder), exco- riation (skin -picking) disorder, and obsessional jea l- ousy, among others. They are generally thought to be clinically and biologically sim ilar to OCD. However, some of these conditions are considered related to OCD mostly for “historical reasons” ( i.e. hoarding disorder). There are also conditions that, despite not being off i- cially recognized as OCD -related, display compulsive behaviors as key ingredients of their clinical present a- tion. They include, for instance, behavioral and su b- stance addictions, bi nge eating disorder, and sexual compulsions. Importantly, each of these conditions are prevalent, affecting from 1 to 3% of the general pop u- lation each. [7] Fortunately, there have been several advances for the treatment of broadly defined compulsive disor ders, inclu ding official DSM -5 OCD and related conditions. However, with a few exceptions (such as the serotonin reuptake inhibitors [or SSRIs], most of these therape u- tic advances have been tested and proved effective for severely ill p atients that do not respond to conventional treatment. They are also characterized by disturbing side effects, such as decreased libido (in the case of SSRIs), [8] weight gain and diabetes (in terms of the newer generation of antipsycho tics), [9] and hepatic problems (in rela tion to opioid antagonists). [10] These strategies are also expensive (as in the case of hosp i- talization for drug addiction), or are expensive and e x- cessively invasive ( e.g. deep brain stimul ation for OCD). [11, 12] In addition, most of these treatments have not been tested in less severe patients or sub threshold cases, which are common and disabling and yet remain substantially understudied.", "Although epidemiological studies show that broadly defined compulsive disorders affect a significant pr o- portion of the general population, [7] milder or even subclinical forms are probably much more common and can still be ass ociated with decreased quality of life, increased absenteeism, and substantial economic burden. In addition, if left untreated, milder forms of compulsive disorders can also develop into more s e- vere cases, which highlight the i mportance of treating individuals early. Unfortunately, with a few exceptions (e.g. self help strategies), [13] there is very little data and clinical guidelines on how to ma nage such ind i- viduals to reduce the burden of the illness or pr event the future development of more severe forms of the illness. We urgently need therapeutic candidates for these individuals. As health professionals, we are r e- sponsible for informing the ge neral population on how to treat and prevent these conditions. Thus, it seems pertinent to investigate whether relatively simple lif e- style interventions can help with milder forms of “compulsive” disorders. Here, we progress this issue by reviewing the evi dence suppor ting or refuting the role of lifestyle interventions in broadly defined co m- pulsive disorders, with a emphasis in DSM -5 OCD and related disorders, particularly OCD, BDD, and hoar d- ing disorder.", "2. LIFESTYLE INTERVE NTIONS FOR OCD", "AND RELATED DISOR DERS Most definitions of lifestyle describe it as “a pa r- ticular way of living (…) of an individual, group, or culture”. [14] Lifestyle has also been described as “(…) the values and ideas supported by (a) person or group” [15] or “a co mposite of motivation s, needs , and wants that are influenced by culture , family , reference groups, and social class”. [16] It has also been argued that lif e- style “manifests in coping with physical, psychological, social, and ec onomic environments on a day -to-day basis” [16] and “is expressed in both work and leisure behavior patterns and (on an individual basis) in activ i- ties, attitudes, interests, opinions, values, and allocation of income” [16] In this p aper, we tentatively define lifestyle as an enduring, pervasive and yet m odifiable pattern of behavior or coping style that reflects pe r- sonal, group or cultural values or needs.", "In medicine, the concept of lifestyle generally e m- braces physical activity, diet, smoking, alcohol inge s- tion sleep and stress , among others [17, 18] While the evidence linking these factors to future cardiovascular events is rel atively consistent, whether poor lifestyle can lead to future mental disorders is conceptually co n- fusing as the theoretical boundaries between poor lif e- style and mental disorders can be blurry. For instance, poor lifestyle can be considered: (i) a predisposing u n- healthy trait for mental disorders that can be subject to preventative measures ( e.g. increasing physical activity can improve depressive and anxiety symptoms), (ii) an integral part of the criteria for mental di sorders ( e.g. as in the DSM -5 criteria “The symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occup a- tional, or other important areas of functioning”), (iii) a consequence of mental disorders ( e.g. depre ssion can lead to decreased physical activity, heavy smoking, alcohol abuse, sleep disturbances and distress), and even (iv) an independent “poor lifestyle” behavioral construct per se.", "In this review, we embrace this medical framework and six re levant and behavior focused lifestyle d o- mains, namely: (i) physical activity , (ii) stress, (iii) diet, Lifestyle in OCRD Current Medicinal Chemistry, 2018 , Vol. 25, No. 00 3 (iv) sleep, (v), alcohol ingestion, and (vi) smoking. We first spec ulate, mostly in psychobiological terms, on the potential value of interventions in th ese areas in OCRDs. Then, we list the evidence supporting the exi s- tence of what could be considered unhealthy habits among patients with OCDRs. Finally, we present ev i- dence, if any, that the modification of that particular lifestyle domain leads to i mprove d outcomes.", "Throughout, we focus on behavioral approaches that aim to reduce symptom severity rather than on specific biological strategies, e.g. in contrast to one previous review on a similar topic, [19] we will not consider the utility of non -behavioral lifestyle factors such nutrients or herbal medicines in OCRDs.", "2.1. Physical Activity", "Although one might assume that physical inactivity is common and detrimental to OCRD patients’ health, this topic is surprisingly understudied. Most clinicians have seen patients with OCRDs who are housebound because of severe avoidant behaviors ( e.g. OCD), self - referential symptoms ( e.g. BDD) or simply comorbid depression ( e.g. hoarding disorder). To the individual suffering from OCDRs, going outdoors to exercise may seem almost imposs ible, and adverse consequences to their mental and physical health may ensue. In contrast, some BDD patients (pa rticularly those with the muscle dysmorphia subtype) may overly exercise and abuse steroids. Thus, assessing phys ical activity di splayed by OCD, BDD and hoarding disorder patients might be important, as it appears to be differe ntially affected across different OCRDs. Regardless of diagnosis, the above -mentioned patterns of behaviors can help mai n- taining symptoms through negative rei nforcement mechanisms. Not surprisingly, the study by Albert et al. [20] has linked sedentary lifestyle (together with cigarette smoking, higher body mass index, greater proportion of ob esity and increased the exposure to antipsychotics) leads to metabolic syndrome in a sa m- ple of treatment seeking OCD patients.", "2.1.1. Psychobiological Rationale for Physical Inte r- ventions in OCRDs Brown et al. [21] suggested that physical activity may treat OCD symptoms through several cognitive mechanisms, including a reduc tion in comorbid depre s- sive symptoms, an increase in self -efficacy (which may generalize to other aspects of life), a distraction from anxiety provoking events, or a decrease on the negative effect of life stresses. It has also been theorized that exercise could also normalize the balance between a p- proach behaviors and OCD avoi dance by increasing positive affect. [22] However, there are also a number of reasons to suspect that physical activity may i m- prove OCD symptoms by biological means. For i n- stance, Bra in derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), the most common neurotrophic factor in the human brain [23] was found in lower levels among treatment naïve OCD patients. [24, 25] Genetic studies indicate that several OCD susceptibility genes, such as DLGAP1, RYR3, GRIN2B and PBX1 -MEIS2 ( -CBP), converge to neurogenesis pathways BDNF -mTOR. [26] Interes t- ingly, there is also pr eliminary evidence of a negative correlation between BDNF levels and number of lost days of work in OCD patients. [27] Since a number of studies have reported an increase in BDNF levels fo l- lowing aerobic exercise, [28] we hypothesize that aer o- bic exercise might increase BDNF levels in sedentary OCD patients, thus contributing to improved sym p- toms.", "2.1.2. Summary of Physical Interventions in OCRDs", "Obsessive -compulsive disorder (OCD) : There are several preliminary studies suggesting that exercise might lead to improve outcomes in OCD. Fifteen se d- entary OCD patients who showed persistent symptoms [i.e. Yale -Brown O bsessive -Compulsive Scale scores (YBO CS) > 16] despite behavioral and/or drug therapy were enrolled in a 12 -week intervention comprising moderate intensity aerobic exercise, cognitive beha v- ioral treatment (CBT), and a contingency payment b e- havioral regime. [21] The protocol comprised supe r- vised group sessions (once a week) at the study fitness facility with an additional 2 to 3 unsupervised sessions per week at the subjects’ homes or through community resources. More than 90% of the participants attended at least 10 of the 12 possible exercise sessions across the 12 -weeks. At the end of 12 weeks, the treatment package resulted in a significant reduction in YBOCS scores that was maintained up to six months post - intervention. No information regarding type of drugs or doses e mployed in this study was available. Therefore, it is not completely clear whether these patients could be considered treatment resistant.", "Almost simultaneously, Lancer et al. conducted a shorter (six weeks) package in sixteen “treatment - resistant” OCD patients (YBOCS scores > 14). Ten of the 11 completers were under unknown doses of escit a- lopram, sertraline, fluoxetine, paroxetine, and ve n- lafaxine for more than six months. Non -completers (t o- tal of 5) reported that the exercise was too demanding. The participants performed super vised aerobic exe r- cises three times a week.

Although all patients r e- mained on a stable SSRI or other antidepressant trea t- ment regimen for at least three months before the study, dosages were not specified. Among completers, exercise adherence across the 12 -week regimen was greater than 80%. Si gnificant reductions in baseline scores were noted, with a pre -post effect sizes on the YBOCS that were much higher (d = 2.20) than the ones shown for associated depression and anxiety sym p- toms, suggesting that the combination of exercise plus CBT may have a potent and an anti -OCD specific e f- fect.", "In a preliminary study, Packer -Hopke et al. invest i- gated the efficacy of a 6 -week, moderate intensity aerobic exe rcise program comprised of two 30 -min aerobic workouts per week in five children with Tourette’s syn drome and OCD.

This currently ongoing study will help clarifying several relevant and una n- swered research questions.", "Lastly, in a reanalysis of data from a previous study, [21] Abrantes et al. [32] investigated changes in OCD symptoms after every exe rcise session performed along a 12-week intervention program for “treatment resi s- tant” OCD. Authors could show significant acute d e- creases in negative mood, anxiety, and OCD symptoms before vs. after each exercise session. However, the magnitude of change in National Institute of Mental Health self -rating scale scores for obsessions and urges to engage in compulsions attenuated over the 12 weeks, whereas amount of decrease in other (mood and anx i- ety) subscales’ scores remained stable. The authors suggest th at patients with OCD may engage in exercise as a way of managing OCD symptoms in the short term, and negative mood and generalized anxiety both on short and long term. However, it is unclear whether this strategy remains effective after 12 weeks of regular exercise.", "In sum, although the topic of sedentary lifestyle in OCRD is understudied, there is growing evidence to consider OCRD populations under increased risk for physical inactivity. Despite the lack of randomized co n- trolled studies utilizing aerobic e xercise interve ntions in OCD patients, some preliminary studies using an add -on methodology (to an on -going well -established treatment strategy) have reported signif icant decreases in OCD symptoms when physical acti vity was combined to trad i- tional CBT in t he manag ement of patients with variable degrees of treatment r esistance.", "Body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) and Hoarding disorder: It is unclear whether physical interventions may help BDD patients. If anything, it seems that these individuals may in fact und er increased risk for enga g- ing in compulsive exercise, [33] so the safety of inte r- ventions in this area should be tested. Given the fr e- quency of obesity among hoarding disorder patients, [34] it is likely that exercise would benefit their health status, al though we were unable to find studies on the impact of physical activities on hoarding symptoms.", "2.2. Stress", "2.2.1. Psychobiological Rationale for Stress Redu c- tion Interventions in OCRDs Broadly speaking, stress may have a role in the pr e- cipitation, in th e expression and in the maintenance of OCD. For instance, stressful life -events (traumatic or not) are frequently reported before the onset of OCD, although they do not seem to be more common in OCD than in other mental disorders. [35] We have prev i- ously d emonstrated that patients with “posttraumatic OCD” without a previous history of subclinical OCD symptoms display lower educ ational levels, greater rates of contamination -washing symptoms, and more severe miscellaneous symptoms as co mpared to post - traumati c OCD patients with a history of subclinical OCD symptoms. [36] However, anecdotal case reports have shown that the content of post -traumatic OCD symptoms can be either related or not to the type of experienced trauma, e.g. while rape can lead to co m- pulsiv e washing, it can also lead to symmetry OCD symptoms. [35].", "Lifestyle in OCRD Current Medicinal Chemistry, 2018 , Vol. 25, No. 00 5 From a behavioral perspective, obsessions are a l- ways distressful events, while compulsions are typ i- cally neg atively reinforced and maintained for by its distressing -reducing properties. [37] In fa ct, the most effective psychotherapeutic approach for OCD is exp o- sure and response prevention (ERP), a strategy that comprises prolonged e xposure to distressing objects and situations coupled with the strict prevention of rituals. [37] Although findings re garding the involv e- ment of the hypothalamic –pituitary –adrenal (HPA) axis are equivocal, [38] it is temping to speculate on the role of HPA activation and increased circulating cortisol on the precipitation and maintenance of OCD. [39] Recently, Morgado and colleagues [40] have measured stress perception and responses in non - depressed OCD patients. Not only they have shown that both Perception of Stress Scale (PSS) -10 and cort i- sol were significantly higher in OCD patients as co m- pared controls, but also that PSS-10 scores correlated positively with the severity of obsessions (but not co m- pulsions) according to the YBOCS. Interestingly, no correlation was found b etween cortisol levels and OCD severity.", "2.2.2. Summary of Stress Interventions in OCRDs", "Obsessive -compulsive disorder (OCD): The fin d- ings reviewed above are suggestive of a link between OCD and perceived stress. Therefore, therapies that include stress among one of its targets ( e.g. kundalini yoga, acceptance and commitment therapy and min d- fulness based therapy, among others) might prove us e- ful in management of some cases of OCD. In the first of these series of studies, Shannahoff -Khalsa et al. [41] have randomized 21 OCD p atients to either a once a week kundalini yoga meditation protocol or a to once a week relaxation response plus min dfulness meditation technique for 3 months. Though only seven patients in each group finished the randomized phase, completers who were treated with kundalini yoga showed greater improvements on the YBOCS, Symptom Checklist -90- R (Obsessive -compulsive and Global Severity Index scales), and Profile of Moods Scale, and greater but non-significant improvements on the PSS and Purpose in Life test.", "In contrast, Hanstede et al. [42] randomized 17 non - clinical subjects (with Obsessi ve-Compulsive Inve n- tory-Revised scores > 32) to either a waiting -list (n = 9) or to a mindfulness training consisting of eight group meetings which addressed meditative breathing, body - scan, and mindful daily living (n=8). The greater i m- provement of OCD sy mptoms in the mindfulness group was ascribed to the ability some patients had of letting bothering thoughts and feelings go. In contrast, a qual i- tative study identified, among several different factors, the discrepancy between their desire for change and t he accepting attitude inherent in the mindfulness concept as a problematic issue during the rapy. [43] Two other projects testing the efficacy of mindfulness in a ra n- domized controlled fashion have been ide ntified though, as of yet, the results have not bee n published. Elements of mindfulness are also included in the so - called acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT). In ACT, fear -evoking situations are construed as opport u- nities to practice acceptance, “defusion” ( e.g. “treating the obsessions as pa ssengers on a bus where the pa r- ticipant is the bus driver”), and present moment awar e- ness. In a recent study, Twohig et al. randomized 69 OCD patients to a group receiving 8 sessions of ACT or to progressive relax ation training with no in -session exposure. [46] Participants from both groups showed significantly decreases in YBOCS scores, but OCD patients assigned to ACT showed significantly larger rates of improvement and more frequent clinically si g- nificant changes than the relaxation -training group. Furth er, when OCD patients had at least a mild level of depression at baseline they also did better in terms of depression. There was also a statistical trend t owards greater improvements in quality of life scores on OCD patients assigned to ACT. [46] In sum, t here are sufficient reasons to ascribe an important etiological and maintenance role of stress in the pathophysiology of OCD. Consistently with this observation, there are at least three studies suggesting that ther apeutic strategy focusing on meditation -related approaches might help some patients with OCD.", "Body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) and Hoarding disorder: Although there was one study testing the acute effect of acceptance/mindfulness vs. cognitive restructuring vs. a distraction strategies on the fr e- quency of thought occu rrence and associated outcomes in BDD, anorexia nervosa and controls, [47] we were unable to find studies emplo ying a study using these strategies as more systematic therapeutic interventions in any other OCRD.", "2.3.

[48] They include dietary lipids ( e.g. omega -3 fatty acids), saturated fat, vitamins B12 and D, and zinc, among others. [48] Cross sectional studies have reported low levels of vitamins B12 [49-51] and D, [51, 52] as well as serum trace elements, [53] in some, but not all, [54] OCD samples. Although it is unclear whether these deficiencies are causes or cons e- quences of OCD symptoms, these nutrients are known to affect BDNF levels. [55-57] It is unclear, though, if the western type of diet has a role in OCRDs. Studies in rats have shown that a 3 -week diet high on saturated fat and sucrose (similar to the western -typical “Junk food”) lead to impaired cognitive function and reduced hippocampal levels of BDNF -related sy naptic plasti c- ity. [58] In turn, omega ‑3 fatty acids activate energy - generating met abolic pathways that influence BDNF and insulin -like growth factor 1 (IGF1) levels. [48] Therefore, theoretically, poor dietary habits can co n- tribute to further decreases in BDNF levels (which may be already low in predisposed individuals), thus leading to OCDRs.", "2.3.2.

One controlled study showed super i- ority of fluoxetine augmented by zinc vs. fluoxetine only in OCD. [60] The literature is almost silent in terms of the impact of healthier dietary habits in OCD though. In fact, most OCD studies have focused on a b- normal eating behaviors and obesity rather than on diet content per se . Sallet et al. [61] investigated the phen o- type of an eating -related OCD and found that OCD patients with eating disorders were more fr equently females with previous psychiatric treatment, higher lifetime prevalence of comorbid conditions, higher anxiety and depression scores, and higher frequency of suicide attempts than did the OCD patients without ea t- ing disorders. Thus, in this study, there seems to be no specific i mpact of eating disorders on OCD, but rather an interaction of the behavior with sex -specific ou t- comes. One can assume, however, that diet compos i- tion ( e.g. amount of daily calories or the ingestion of specific nutrients) ma y be disturbed in some OCD cases with comorbid eating disorders. However, it is unclear whether the rectification of eating disorders in OCD cases contribute the ameliorate OCD symptoms.", "Nevertheless, a study found that the rates of eating disorders among treatment refractory OCD patients do not differ substantially from those observed in non -OCD treatment refractory anxiety disorders. [62] An- other study [20] found metabolic syndrome, abdominal obesity, hypertension, high triglycerides, low high - density lip oprotein cholesterol levels, and fasting h y- perglycemia in a substantial proportion of OCD p a- tients. However, in this sample, metabolic syndrome was associated with cigarette smoking, sedentary lif e- style, higher body mass index, greater proportion of obesit y and greater exposure to antipsychotics, [20] and were therefore associated with OCD but not considered to be core to OCD per se. Therefore, these studies su g- gest that there is some room for diet and other lif estyle intervention in OCD patients.", "There is also evidence that severe OCD can lead to life-threatening eating habits. [63] In Drummond et al. study, 104 severe OCD patients and 101 patients with other conditions ( e.g. schizophrenia, mood, personality, substance use, anxiety or somatoform spectrum di sor- ders) admitted to an acute psychiatric unit were co m- pared. Despite being younger and on lower doses of antipsychotics, OCD patients were more likely to have raised blood lipids and creatinine. These abnormal p a- rameters were ascribed to difficulties with food/fluid intake and “frequent problems with urinary and/or fecal incontinence, related to either slowness in traveling to the toilet due to compulsive rituals or avoidance of to i- let areas for fear of contamination”.", "Body dysmorphic disorder (BDD): A few studies have found significant links between BDD and eating disorders. One investigation [64] reported that almost a third of BDD subjects had a comorbid lifetime eating disorder. This group was more frequently female, non - African American, and had signif icantly greater rates of psychiatric comorbidity, body image disturbance and dissatisfaction. They were also more liked to have history of being admi tted in the hospital for psychiatric problems, and of receiving a greater number of psych o- therapy sessions and ps ychotropic medications. Thus, BDD with disturbed eating behavior seem to be more severe.", "Hoarding disorder: Early studies have found an a s- sociation between hoarding symptoms in OCD patients and the occurrence of eating disorders. [65] These fin d- ings have been recently replicated in hoarding disorder samples, and also extended to include an association between hoarding and obesity.

However, increased body mass index seems to be ascr ibed to u n- specific (general) risk factors for obesity and medic a- tion use (antips ychotics) in OCD samples, yet more closely related to hoarding symptoms severity.

A recent meta-analyses of twelve studies assessing sleep mea s- ures in individuals with OCD found the prevalence of DSPD to be higher and sleep duration to be shorter in OCD subjects than in controls, independently from the effect of either comorbid depression or medication use. [67] Similarly, a study using non -clinical samples found that subjects with DSPD had elevated OCD symptoms and greater rates of disorders chara cterized by intr usive thoughts ( i.e. OCD, generalized anxiety disorder, major depression, or dysthymia), as compared with the participants without DSPD. [68] Thus, the o c- currence of DSPD in psychiatric populations does not seem to be diagnostically specific.", "Unfortunately , only few studies have attempted to isolate OCD phenotypes typically associated with sleep disturbances. One of these investigations found DSPD to affect up to 42% of patients from a severe and trea t- ment r esistant OCD sample. In this study, DSPD p a- tients were also significantly more likely to be male, younger and to be affected by more severe and di s- abling OCD. [69] In contrast, a study drawing a non - clinical sample from the Am azon's Mechanical Turk revealed positive correlations between the unacceptable thoughts (sexual/religious) domain of OCD and inso m- nia.

[72, 73] The first case involved a 54 year -old woman with OCD and DSPD who besides being treated with regular ERP, was motivated to advance her sleep phase by different techniques, including mor ning call -ins to the clinic to report her status. Eventually, her sleep times improved from a bedtime of 06:00 and a wake t ime of 13:00 to a bedtime of 00:00 and a wake time of 10:00. Treatment was associated with a decrease of 15 -points on the YBOCS. [72] The second case was a young man with OCD and insomnia “successfully treated” with an early sleep intervention that include d the use of an actigr a- phy to provide the patient feedback about the his i n- somnia complaints and sleep hygiene education ( e.g., avoidance of bedside drinking, smoking, snacking, and Internet use). [73] Unfortunately though, this later study did not include an assessment of YBOCS scores.

Alcohol Use", "2.5.1. Psychobiological Rationale", "There is a well -known and consistent association between alcohol use disorders and major depressive episodes. While some major depressive episodes seem to follow an independent course from heavy drinking, there is also a significant portion of m ajor depressive episodes that seem to be purely caused heavy drinking and that tend to di sappear if patients quit drinking. [75] It has been suggested that alcohol induced depression may be related to underlying serotonergic abnormal i- ties. [76] While a few follow up studies have shown alcohol abuse to increase the risk for subsequent OCD, [77-79] some clinicians have suggested that heavy drinking may precipitate OCD in predisposed individ u- als through alcohol -induced “hyposerotoninemia.” [80] It has been sho w, though, that chronic binge -like alc o- hol consumption in young rates causes depression -like symptoms through decreases in BDNF levels and ass o- ciated effects on neurogenesis. [81] 8 Current Medicinal Chemistry, 2018 , Vol. 25, No. 00 Fontenelle et al. 2.5.2. Summary of the Clinical Literature on Alcohol and OCRDs Obsessive -compulsive disorder (OCD): The liter a- ture on alcohol and other substance use disorders (SUD) in OCD is excessively large and complex for comprising several epidemiological studies and almost all comorbidity studies performed in treatment seeking samples of pa tients with both conditions. It is beyond the scope of this paper to summarize these findings. However, in one particularly relevant review on the subject, Cuzen et al. [82] noted that substance use di s- orders comorbidity in OCD varies considerably accor d- ing to sampling method ( e.g. comm unity vs. clinical samples), suggesting that severity of OCD itself may differentially influence SUD risk in OCD populations. They ascribe this phenomenon to the fact that clinicians from OCD clinics are generally inclined to firstly refer comorbid cases to specialized substance centers and less likely to include “irregular attenders” (su bstance use disorder patients) on their studies.", "It is important to investigate what if any OCD ph e- notype is associated with substance use d isorders, so patients under risk might be under identified and treated early. Specifically in relation to alcohol use di s- orders (AUD), Ge ntil and colleagues [83] reported that 7.5% of 630 OCD patients from seven Brazilian un i- versity services presented AUD comorbidity. They were more likely to be men, to have received previous psychiatric treatment, to present lifetime suicidal thoughts and attempts and higher scores in the hoarding dimension. Although the first three attributes have a l- ready been independent ly associated with AUS, it is reasonable to hypothesize that alcohol use can contri b- ute to hoarding disorder’s characteristic inability to discard due to self neglect. Thus, reducing alcohol use may help minimizing hoarding symptoms.", "In this same study, [83] patients with OCD and AUD also exhibited greater rates of generalized anx i- ety, somatization, and compulsive sexual behavior di s- orders. Although this study had cross -sectional design, age at onset of both OCD and AUD in the comorbid group allowed us to s peculate on causality issues. While age at OCD symptom o nset was 9.4 years, the mean age for the first episode of alcohol abuse or d e- pendence was much later, i.e. at 22.1 years. Thus, if anything, it seems that OCD patients in this study were using alcohol as an attempt to self -medicate. However, as reported above, clinicians need to consider that a l- cohol use may interfere with the natural fear extin ction and play a role in the persistence of symptoms and/or treatment resistance in OCD patients. Unfortunate ly, we were unable to find studies investigating the eff i- cacy of alcohol related interventions in OCD cases c o- morbid with AUD.", "Body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) and Hoarding disorder: A few additional studies also addressed the issue of alcohol and other SUD in BDD. For instance, in a study with 176 BDD subjects, Grant et al. [84] re- ported that 48.9% had a lifetime and 17% had current diagnosis of a SUD. In this study, almost 70% of su b- jects reported that BDD contributed to their SUD. The only difference betwe en BDD with vs. without SUD was a significantly higher rate of suicide attempts in the former. In the same vein, Bjornsson et al. [85] found an increase rate of lifetime SUD in early (age 17 or younger) vs. late -onset (age 18 or older) BDD, also favoring t he hypothesis that SUD are more often se c- ondary to BDD. One study found that “helping beha v- iors”, a strategy stimulated by some SUD treatment protocols (such as Alcoholics Anonymous) was found to increase remission of SUD (significantly) and BDD (to a tren d level) in a sample of BDD patients [86]. In sum, AUD are probably more common in milder non-treatment seeking cases than more severe OCD cases seen in clinical settings. Although we were u n- able to retrieve any intervention study targeting su b- stance use disorders in OCD samples as a way of trea t- ing comorbid OCD symptoms, it seems important to discontinue AUD in OCD (and probably hoarding di s- order) as a way of managing hoarding symptoms and breaking the OCD cycle in comorbid cases with assoc i- ated with ther apeutic resistance. An increase in the contact with friends, emphasized by the so -called “helping behaviors”, may lead to remission of BDD.", "2.6. Smoking", "2.6.1.

Only 14% were current smokers (compared with 25% in the general Swedish population), 72% had never smoked, and 11 previous smokers had stopped, mostly without any difficulties. These profiles were further investigated in sixty -four subjects with OCD, who were assessed with a q ues- tionnaire concerning their smoking habits, the Karoli n- ska Scales of Personality, and a self -report questio n- naire on compulsive traits by Bejerot et al. [93] In the later study, OCD non -smokers were more easily f a- tigued, more inclined to worry, more remo rseful, less self-confident, less impulsive, more frequently uneasy when urged to speed up, and displayed obsessive - compulsive personality disorder more often than smo k- ers with OCD.", "Dell’Osso et al. [94] reported significant cross - national differences in the prevalence rates of smoking habits in 504 OCD patients recruited through the Inte r- national College of Obsessive Compulsive Spectrum Disorders (ICOCS) network. The cross -sectional prev a- lence of cigarette smoking was a little higher than in former Swedis h studies (24.4% of the sample). Of note, smoking OCD patients were more likely to be females and to present Tourette's syndrome and tic disorder. In contrast, former smokers reported a higher number of suicide attempts. In another study, [95] smoking stat us differed significantly in 167 OCD patients divided a c- cording to their main symptom dimensions, i.e. smo k- ing ratio was significantly higher in the symmetry group than in those with washing symptoms and taboo thoughts.", "Abramovitch et al. , [96] replicated the negative a s- sociation between OCD and smoking by showing that its prev alence rates in adults with OCD (13.3%) and parents of youth with OCD (9.5%) samples were si g- nificantly lower than those found in representative samples of the general population and individuals with other Axis I disorders. The authors [96] were also u n- able to find smokers among OCD patients without clinically significant depre ssive symptoms, suggesting a close link between smoking and depression in OCD samples. However, whether OCD p atients may self - medicate their depression by smoking, or tobacco use predisposes to depression in OCD samples is still an open question. Only prospective studies would be able to clarify this question.", "One study suggests that nicotine could have benef i- cial effects for OCD patients.

Firstly, it is a narrative, opinionated review based on an arbitrarily defined co n- cept of lifestyle that has been “transplanted” fr om in- ternal med icine to psychiatry. For instance, it could be argued that, when it comes to mental disorders, other lifestyle factors ( e.g. patterns of interpersonal relatio n- ships) that may be important haven’t been assessed. However, considering the lack of available definitions in the field, our lifestyle domains represent at least an initial framework for future stu dies in OCRDs. Second, the existing literature has many gaps, with poor quality studies ( i.e. case reports) on certain lif estyle aspects of OCRD cases (such as the efficacy of the adoption of healthier diet and sleep habits in OCRDs) and an abs o-lute dearth of investigation in other relevant areas ( e.g. substance use interventions in individuals with dual diagnosis). Importantly, even better stu dies where characterized by small number of research subjects. In this review, we have found evidence supporting an unhealthy lifestyle in OCRDs that is specifically related to sedentarism, increased stress, abnormal ea t- ing behaviors, decreased sleep quali ty, and increased alcohol consumption. There is mixed evidence suppor t- ing the use of strategies and recommendations that ta r- get these lifestyle d imensions in OCRDs, with the most promising interventions involving the adoption of a program of physical activ ity regime and, most consi s- tently, meditation -based therapies (Fig. 1). It also seems reasonable to expect that reduction of alcohol abuse may lead to an improvement of OCD symptoms, given its negative interference on fear extinction pro c- esses. Similarly, treatment of co -morbid DSPD through the adoption of healthier sleeps habits ( e.g. chronothe r- apy) may help different forms of OCD.

MET HODS: One", "hundred and fourteen participants with hoarding problems responded to a series of self -report tools. Linear regression models were created with the FANTASTIC lifestyle checklist scores as dependent variables and age, number of stressful life events (SLEs), speed of progression, duration of illness, severity of hoarding symptoms, internalized stigma, and self -efficacy as independent variables. RESULTS: Poorer global lifestyle among people with hoarding was predicted by greater number of SLEs involving loss or deprivation, increased internalized stigma, and worse self -efficacy. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that different aspects of lifestyle can be linked to hoarding features.", "Key-words: hoarding; smoking; alcohol, sleep, obesity, lifestyle INTRODUCTION Hoarding disorder (HD) is a complex psychiatric disorder characterized by inability to discard, clutter and, in most cases, excessive acquisition behaviors. (APA, 2013) It is relatively common, with a recent meta -analysis suggesting it to affect up to the 2.5% of the general population. (Postlethwaite, Kellett, & Mataix -Cols, 2019) Different studies have demonstrated HD to be associat ed with a range of poor outcomes, including days lost at work, (D. F. Tolin, Frost, Steketee, Gray, & Fitch, 2008) decreased functioning, (Frost, Hristova, Steketee, & Tolin, 2013) poor quality of life, (D. F. Tolin et al., 2019) and medical concerns (D. F. Tolin et al., 2008) (e.g. cardiovascular / metabolic dysfunction, chronic pain, and sleep apnea). (Nutley et al., 2021) One key contributor to these concerns may be the individual’s lifestyle. Yet, despite the number of findings indicating the negative impact that HD can have in the lives of people with HD, the re is no study examining how poor the lifestyles of these individuals can be. Although there has been an increased interest in the lifestyle behaviors of people with mental illness in general, (Firth et al., 2019) what is understood by “lifestyle” remains elusive. (L. F. Fontenelle, Zeni -Graiff, Quintas, & Yücel, 2018) A tentative definition that attempts to synthetize existing concepts suggests lifestyle to be an enduring, pervasive and yet modifiable pattern of behavior or coping style that may reflect personal, group or cultural values or needs. (L. F. Fontenelle et al., 2018) In medicine, the concept of lifestyle and its associated behaviors generally embraces multiple components, such as smoking and other drug use, excessive alcohol consumption, sleep disturbance, physical activity and sedentary time, dietary risks, and stress management, among other factors. (L. F. Fontenelle et al., 2018) Accordingly, there are", "a number of valid instruments available for the quantification of poor lifestyle, (Porto, Kümpel, Castro, Oliveira, & Alfieri, 2015) which has been consistently linked to poor cardiovascular health through multiple biological mechanisms. (Weisburger, 2002)", "Although studies have demonstrated that discrete lifestyle components (or consequences of poor lifestyle behaviors) can be increased or disproportionally represented among individuals with HD (including smoking, (Raines, Unruh, Zvolensky, & Schmidt, 2014) excessive alcohol consumption, (Samuels et al., 2008) sleep disturbances, (Dozier et al., 2020; Mahnke et al., 2020; Raines et al., 2014) loss of social contacts, (Destrée et al., 2020) obesity and excess weight), (D. F. Tolin et al., 2008) we are not aware of any previous study that has addressed lifestyle as one single and broad construct in people with HD. However, an increased frequency of cardiovascular/metaboli c dysfunctions in HD samples (Nutley et al., 2021) suggests that at least a subset of people with HD exhibit broadly poor lifestyle behaviors. Importantly, addressing lifestyle and physical health broadly by boosting social support, (Verheijden, Bakx, van Weel, Koelen, & van Staveren, 2005) minimizing internalized stigma, (Link, Phelan, & Sullivan, 2018) and ultimately increasing self -efficacy (Jackson, Tucker, & Herman, 2007) may be helpful for people with HD. We speculate that the functional impairment due to clutter may be particularly detrimental to lifestyle of people with HD by precluding the use of living spaces for activities such as preparing meals, using appliances, eating at tables, and sleeping in one’s bed. (Catherine R. Ayers, Schiehser, Liu, & Loebach Wetherell, 2012) People with hoarding may avoid social contacts for being ashamed of the clutter in their homes (e.g. (I. S. Fontenelle, Fontenelle, et al., 2010) ). In addition, to deal with the undesirable situations caused by clutter and yet manage to eat and sleep “properly”, people with hoarding problems may re ly on the “convenience” of fast food, (Raines, Boffa, Allan, Short, & Schmidt, 2015) alcohol or sleeping pills, which may further negatively impact one’s lifestyle. Furthermore, it is reasonable to hypothesize that the lifestyle of people with HD who present with hoarding symptoms after stressful life events (e.g. loss or deprivation (Destrée et al., 2020) ), who developed symptoms more rapidly (e.g.", "(Thompson et al., 2020) ), or who have a longer duration of illness may be more likely to “deteriorate” and/or remain unhealthy.", "For the reasons reported above, in this online study, we predicted that poor lifestyle among people with hoarding problems would be predicted by environmental factors (i.e. traumatic", "events as precipitants), natural history (i.e. faster speed of progression and longer duration of illness), illness characteristics [i.e. severity of hoarding symptoms (particularly clutter)], and the consequences of having a mental illness (i.e. internalized stigma and self -efficacy). We also performed exploratory analysis using the above -mentioned variables to identify the determinants of the three lifestyle domains (problematic health behaviors, poor emotional regulation, and positive life investments). (Wilson, Nielsen, & Ciliska, 1984) No specific hypotheses were made in relation to these exploratory analyses. METHODS Sample Individuals with problematic hoarding behaviors were invited to participate in a study about hoarding by means of advertisements on social media platforms (i.e. Facebook, Instagram and Reddit), forums and support groups for hoarding. Inclusion crit eria comprised 1) Problematic hoarding behaviors as confirmed by Saving Inventory- Revised (SI -R) total score > 39), (Kellman -McFarlane et al., 2019) 2) age above 18 years old, and 3) being able to read and fill out forms.", "One hundred and fourteen eligible participants fulfilled criteria for inclusion and were eventually selected. Data was collected using Qualtrics. The survey took approxim ately 45 minutes to complete. Participants were allowed to save their responses and resume their unfinished survey later. The Monash University Human Research Ethics Committee approved the research protocol. Each volunteer agreed with his or her own partic ipation after reading the explanatory statement and signing electronically. An initial questionnaire assessed demographic data and characteristics of hoarding symptoms, including age at onset and age at onset of distress related to hoarding.", "Assessment The Fantastic Lifestyle Checklist (Wilson et al., 1984) is a 25 -item measure that assesses a series of lifestyle domains corresponding to the acronym FANTASTIC (family, friends, activity, nutrition, tobacco/toxins, alcohol, sleep, seatbelt, stress and safe sex, type of behavior , insight and career). (CSEP, 2003) Each item is scored on a 5 -point Likert scale from 0 to 4,", "with greater scores indicating a healthi er lifestyle. Subscores were calculated based on the study by Wilhelm et al., (Wilhelm, Handley, & Reddy, 2016) who described three factors, namely “positive life investments” (e.g. “I relax and enjoy leisure time”; PLI), “poor emotional regulation” (e.g. “I feel angry or hostile”; PER) and “poor health behaviors” (e.g. excessive ingestion of sugar, salt, animal fats, or junk food; PHB).", "The Obsessive -Compulsive and Related Disorders Traumatic and Stressful Life Events Scale, hoarding version (OTRAS- HV) assesses exposure to ten traumatic or SLE related to loss and/or deprivation before/simultaneously or after the onset of the respondents’ hoarding; The items are grouped into five clusters, namely (1) termination of personal relationships/death of loved ones (Destrée et al., 2020; D. F. Tolin, Meunier, Frost, & Steketee, 2010) , (2) forced subtraction of possessions (Hartl et al., 2004; Landau et al., 2011; Samuels et al., 2008) , (3) material deprivation (Frost & Gross, 1993; Landau et al., 2011) (4) failure to meet standards (Hartl et al., 2004; Samuels et al., 2008) and (5) loss of personal items. (Timpano, Keough, Traeger, & Schmidt, 2011)", "The Saving Inventory -Revised (SI -R) is a 23- item self -report scale used to measure severity of hoarding symptoms. (Frost, Steketee, & Grisham, 2004) It provides scores on three different dimensions, namely difficult discarding, clutter and excessive acquisition. The original SI -R scale has shown acceptable psychometric properti es (including good internal consistency, test - retest reliabilities, convergent and divergent validities) (Frost et al., 2004; David F. Tolin, Frost, & Steketee, 2010) and has been translated and validated in multiple cultures (e.g. (I. S. Fontenelle, Prazeres, et al., 2010) ). Total scores vary from 0 to 92. Recently, a score of 39 was proposed as the opt imal cut -off to differentiate hoarders from non- hoarders (Kellman - McFarlane et al., 2019) .", "The General Self -Efficacy Scale (GSES) is a 10- item self -report scale that measures perceived self-efficacy with the aim of predicting how the respondent copes with daily hassles and adapts to all kinds of SLEs (e.g. “I can always manage to solve difficult problems if I try hard enough”) (Schwarzer & Jerusalem, 1995) . The original version of the GSES is unidimensional and generates one single total score (Schwarzer & Jerusalem, 1995) . The GSES has demonstrated appropriate psychometrics properties across different cultures (Luszczynska, Scholz, & Schwarzer, 2005) . Its total scores range from 10 to 40 with higher scores indicating greater perceived self -efficacy (Schwarzer & Jerusalem, 1995) .", "The Internalized Stigma of Mental Illness Inventory -10 (ISMI -10) is 10- item version of the original 29 items ISMI -29 (Boyd, Otilingam, & Deforge, 2014) . Like its predecessor, the ISMI - 10 measures the subjective perception of devaluation, margina lization, secrecy, shame, and withdrawal presented by people with psychiatric disorders. (Boyd et al., 2014) It has a unidimensional factor structure and good psychometric properties (Boyd et al., 2014) . The total scores of the ISMI -10 range from 10 to 40, the higher scores indicating greater internalize d stigma.", "Analytic plan To test our hypotheses, four linear regressions were planned, as the dependent variables (the total FANTASTIC score and its three subscores) were continuous and likely to be normally distributed. Based on the existing literature, age, total number of loss and deprivation events happening before or at onset of problematic hoarding behaviors, “speed of progression” (interval between the onset of hoarding behaviors and distress associated with hoarding), duration of illness (current a ge minus age at onset of distress associated with hoarding), SI -R subscores, (Frost et al., 2004) GSES (Schwarzer & Jerusalem, 1995) and ISMI 10 (Boyd et al., 2014) were entered as independent variables. All VIF levels were below 2.5, indicating that there was no multicollinearity. The level of statistical significance was .05.", "RESULTS Linear regression 1: Total lifestyle scores Inspection of the histogram and results of the Shapiro- Wilk statistics confirmed that there was no violation of the normality of the distribution of the FANTASTIC total scores [W (80) = .975; p= .12], thus confirming t hat a linear regression could be employed.

More specifically, participants with hoarding problems who reported a greater number of SLE related to loss or deprivation as “precipitants” of hoarding, also reported increased internalized stigma, and worse self -efficacy exhibited poorer global lifestyle. In addition, exploratory analyses revealed the following findings: Firstly, longer duration of illness was associated with the “poor health behaviors” domain of lifestyle. Secondly, difficult discarding and higher internalized stigma predicted worse “emotional regulation” subscores of lifestyle. Finally, lower internalized stigma and superior self -efficacy were also associated with greater “positive life investments”. Taken together, these findings suggest that different aspects of lifestyle can be linked to hoarding “precipitants” (i.e. SLEs), hoarding symptoms (difficult discarding and duration of illness), and putative “consequences” of hoarding (e.g. internalized stigma and self - efficacy).", "The fact that SLEs experienced before the onset of hoarding were associated with poorer lifestyle (total FANTASTIC scores) is consistent with previous investigations showing a relationship between SLEs and substance use, (Wolitzky -Taylor, Bobova, Zinbarg, Mineka, & Craske, 2012) smoking, (Mainous et al., 2010) high caloric intake (Mainous et al., 2010) , poor sleep (Dao -Tran, Anderson, & Seib, 2017) and sedentary lifestyle. (Mainous et al., 2010) Seib et al. (Seib et al., 2014) demonstrate that the different characteris tics of SLE (e.g. their duration or magnitude) are associated with different domains of lifestyle. That said, three aspects of our SLE findings are novel in HD. Firstly, we showed that the relationship between SLE and lifestyle to involve the total number of SLEs. Previous longitudinal studies have shown the number of general SLE to determine increased risk for metabolic syndrome in the future.", "(Rutters et al., 2015) Secondly, our hoarding- related events comprised SLEs related to loss and deprivation. This is consistent with studies showing loss, particularly of loss social status, to be especially noxious or pathogenic across species. (Cohen, Murphy, & Prather, 2019) Lastly, SLE occurred before the onset of hoarding, suggesting that the effects of stress on lifestyle measures seem to be enduring. (Agorastos, Pervanidou, Chrousos, & Baker, 2019)", "We also found that duration of illness (i.e. current age minus age at onset of problematic hoarding symptoms) was the only predictor of the “poor health behaviors” domain of lifestyle. Likewise, similar findings were described in the context of bipolar disorder (Soreca et al ., 2008) and schizophrenia. (Mitchell et al., 2013; Vancampfort et al., 2013) Yet, despite HD being described as a “pr ogressive illness” (i.e. a condition whose symptoms tend to deteriorate with the passage of time), (Dozier, Porter, & Ayers, 2016) we are not aware of much information on the correlates of HD chronicity, with most studies focusing on age at onset of symptoms instead (e.g. (Zaboski et al., 2019) ). Nevertheless, older adults with hoarding reported more medical conditions (90%) than older adults without HD (44%). (C. R. Ayers, Iqbal, & Strickland, 2014) Although it is reasonable to assume that “poor insight, self -neglect, an d cognitive difficulties” related to lifelong hoarding may affect lifestyle behaviors, by decreasing attendance to health services or interfering with regular medication use, (C. R. Ayers et al., 2014) it is also possible that “poor health behaviors” contribute to the persistence of hoarding by decreasing physical vigor and the ability to discard possessions.", "In contrast to our init ial hypothesis, difficulty discarding, and not clutter, was associated with poor lifestyle, particularly with the latter’s “poor emotional regulation” domain (Phung, Moulding, Taylor, & Nedeljkovic, 2015; Taylor, Moulding, & Nedeljkovic, 2018; Taylor,", "Theiler, Nedeljkovic, & Moulding, 2019; David F Tolin, Levy, Wootton, Hallion, & Stevens, 2018) . This finding sugge sts difficult discarding to have stronger relationships to psychopathology, at least when it comes to its lifestyle aspects. In DSM -5, difficult discarding and clutter are key diagnostic components of HD, with excessive acquisition being listed as a specif ier that is not essential for diagnosis. (APA, 2013) Interestingly, difficulty discarding was shown to have lower specificity and to be more sensitive to symptoms of non- hoarding individuals than clutter. (Kellman -McFarlane et al., 2019) Thus, difficulty discarding may be more intrinsically related to general psychopathology. Finally, it is also possible that some individuals with hoarding and significant clutter may still be able to perform certain outdoors activities (e.g. exercise), th us being less impacted by clutter at home.", "We also found that internalized stigma predicted different domains of lifestyle behaviors, including poor emotional regulation, positive life investments, and total lifestyle scores. Internalized (or self) stigma occurs when the faces of public stigma, namely difference (“They aren’t like me”), disdain (“They are bad”), and blame (“They are responsible”) are accepted and internalized by the individual. (Chasson, Guy, Bates, & Corrigan, 2018) Although the London Field Trial for HD initially suggested that the majority of people with HD experience no or low stigma from an HD label, (Mataix -Cols, Billotti, Fernández de la Cruz, & Nordsletten, 2013) it was later reported that HD is viewed more negatively by the public than OCD across all facets of public stigma and that among people with hoarding, HD disdain was also inversely rated to treatment -seeking willingness. (Chasson et al., 2018) . Our findings are consistent with the idea that internalized stigma can affect people with hoarding problems, by depleting the social and psychological resources need to “craft a healthy lifestyle or situate themselves propitiously with respect to health risks and protective factors ”. (Link et al., 2018) The \"Why try\" effect is an overarching phenomenon that comprises the disbelief in one’s o wn competences in face of impediments or difficulties (low self -efficacy) and its adverse effects on goal -related behaviors. (Corrigan, Larson, & Rüsch, 2009; Corrigan & Rao, 2012) In agreement with the latter model, low self -efficacy predicted lower “positive life investments” in our sample. However, because our study lacked healthy control participants, we cannot assume that the relationship between self -efficacy problems and poor investments in lifestyle was different from that reported in people without hoarding. Further, in some cases, it may be difficult to disentangle poor insight (a transdiagnostic phenomenon that may be prese nt in different mental health conditions, including other obsessive -compulsive and related disorders", "(Stein et al., 2016) ) from self- efficacy, as individuals may also seem convinced about their own incompetence to handle their problematic/compulsive behaviors. (Frost, Tolin, & Maltby, 2010) Nevertheless, our findings suggest it may be valuable endeavor to test interventions aimed at increasing self -efficacy to improve lifestyle (Ashford, Edmunds, & French, 2010; Sol, van der Graaf, van Petersen, & Visseren, 2011) in the context of problematic hoarding behaviors.", "Our study has some significant limitations. Firstly, it included a small sample size ascertained through the Internet and self -reports rather than face- to-face interviews. Although it is unclear how our findings can be generalizable to other (e.g. clinical) settings, we enrolled subjects that have significant hoarding problems, many of which would not show up to face -to-face interviews due to increased severity, internalized stigma, and disability (rather than less significant problems). Secondly, our study is cross sectional. Thus, it is difficult to determine whether poo r lifestyle behaviors were causes or consequences of hoarding behaviors, particularly in relation to difficult discarding symptoms, which represent state based (“last week”) psychopathologies. Nevertheless, other than the SI -R, variables are either histori cal (OTRaS -HV) or trait -based (GSES and ISMI -10). Thirdly, we used FANTASTIC scores that were based on a sample of clinical subjects with self -injurious and suicidal behaviors. (Wilhelm et al., 2016) Further studies on the ability of these factors to predict undesirable outcomes, particularly in a sample with our characteristics (internet) would be helpful to validate our findings.", "IMPLICATIONS FOR CLINICAL PRACTICE Despite these limitations, we believe our study raises interesting points for further investigation in controlled trials to determine whether lifestyle interventions may work to decrease problematic hoarding behaviors. For example, stress management activities such as mindfulness mediation may increase the individual’s awareness of negative cognitions (blame, disdain) and allow the individual to recognize thoughts as thoughts rather than truths. Moreover, interventions targeting poor health behaviors, such as dietary patterns, may not only work to improve lifestyle and quality of life of those with HD, but also to relieve symptom severity.

Depress Anxiety,", "5 DISCUSSÃO", "Por meio de dois artigos, buscamos discutir sobre a importância da avaliação do es tilo de vida em populações com TRTOC, com ênfase no TA. O primeiro artigo levanta uma questão importante: será que pacientes com TOC ou TRTOC poderiam apresentar melhor prognóstico caso mudanças no estilo de vida fossem implementadas? Levando -se em consideração que muitos pacientes não conseguem acesso a profissionais de saúde mental capacitados (PITTENGER et al., 2021) e muitas vezes as estratégias famacoterápicas (ex: ISRS) podem causar efeitos colaterais desagradáveis (PIZARRO et al., 2014) , é importante reconhecer que mudanças no estilo de vida, como a prática de atividade física regular ou melhora da ingesta calórica poderiam trazer benefícios a longo prazo no que concerne à redução do risco cardiovascular, se não aos seus sintomas psiquiátricos. Uma quest ão a ser discutida, é se o estilo de vida poderia proteger ou elevar o risco do desenvolvimento destes transtornos, uma vez que os níveis de BDNF reduzem em situações de maior estresse, sedentarismo, dieta inapropriada, qualidade de sono ruim e uso de álcool (CHAN et al., 2008; GIESE et al., 2013) . Esta redução poderia precipitar o surgimento de sintomas obsessivo- compulsivos em indiví duos predispostos ao TOC ou TRTOC (MAINA et al., 2010) . Em contrapartida , a adoção de um estilo de vida positivo, a ser estimulado desde a infância, elevaria os níveis de BDNF, o que poderia ser um fator de proteção ao desenvolvimento de stes transtornos me ntais.", "No segundo artigo, levantamos a hipótese de uma possível relação entre aspectos do estilo de vida de indivíduos com comportamentos problemáticos de acumulação e a presença de eventos es tressores ao longo da vida, dificuldade em se desfazer de objet os, tempo de duração do transtorno, além de maior estigma internalizado e pior autoeficácia. Em relação aos eventos estressores vividos, nosso achado é consistente com dados anteriormente descritos na literatura (HARTL et al., 2005; LANDAU et al., 2011) . Hartl e colaboradores (2005) encontraram, entre os indivíduos que acumulavam compulsivamente, maior história de traumas prévios e maior comorbidade com transtorno do estresse pós -traumático e transtorno de déficit de atenção/hiperatividade comparado aos controles (HARTL et al., 2005) . Interessantemente, quando o evento estressor é relatado pelos pacientes como o gatilho para o início da compulsão de acumular, o início dos sintomas se deu mais t ardiamente do que naqueles que não relataram eventos prévios (GRISHAM et al., 2006) .", "Para avaliação do estilo de vida no segundo artigo, utilizamos a escala FANTASTIC que possui 25 itens a serem autopreenchidos, dentre eles: relacionamento com familiares e", "amigos, prática de atividade física, assim como momentos de relaxamento, hábitos nutricionais, uso de drogas, de álcool e tabagismo, característica sobre o sono, comportamentos de risco que podem levar à morte acidental, como o uso inconsistente de cintos de segurança, agressividade ou estresse elevado, características da personalidad e, pensamento positivo e satisfação com o trabalho (WILSON; CILISKA, 1984 ). A análise fatorial conduzida por Wilhelm identificou três fatores gerados pela FANTASTIC, nomeadamente: \"investimentos positivos na vida\" (por exemplo, \"Eu relaxo e aproveito o tempo de lazer\"), \"regulação emocional deficiente\" (por exemplo, \"Sinto- me zangado ou hostil”) e \"comportamentos de saúde problemáticos\" (por exemplo, ingestão excessiva de açúcar, sal, gordura animais ou fast -food) (WILHELM; HANDLEY; REDDY, 2016) . Por ser simples e prática, essa escala já foi validada em diversos países, como Canadá, Brasil, Austrália e Coréia do Sul, principalmente em populações de atenção primária ou com certas condições clínicas, como diabetes, hipertensão ou síndrome metabólica (WILHELM; HANDLEY; REDDY, 2016) . Em relação a transtornos mentais, a escala já foi utilizada, por exemplo, em pacientes deprimidos (KI M; KIM; KIM., 2007) , em pacientes que deram entrada em emergências com relato de automutilação ou ideação suicida (BERG; WILHELM; HANDLEY, 2020) .", "A relação entre o estilo de vida e a ocorrência ou melhora dos transtornos mentais está bem estabelecida. Mudanças como cessação do tabagismo e alcoolismo, melhora do padrão dietético e melhora das relações interpessoais são exemplos de estratégias que devem ser estimuladas junto aos pacientes. Na depressão, por exemplo, a prática regular de exercícios físicos apresenta um tamanho de efeito mode rado a elevado nos pacientes quando comparados aos controles, sendo indicado como tratamento adjunto aos antidepressivos (KVAM et al., 2016) . Além disso, estruturas cerebrais como hipocampo, córtex pré -frontal e região do cíngulo anterior, que estão reduzidas em pacientes com depressão, apresentam melhora de volume após a prática regular de atividade física (GUJRAL, AIZENSTEIN, REYNOLDS, 2017) . Mesmo não havendo estudos no TA, podemos presumir que a prática regular de exercício físico traria melhora n a saúde física e mental do indivíduo. Outra estratégia útil, por exemplo, para pacientes com TRTOC e TA, seria intervenções baseadas em mindfulness , muito bem estudadas em indivíduos com depressão, dor crônica, tabagismo e transtornos de adição (GOLDBERG e t al., 2018) . Até o momento, não temos conhecimento de nenhum estudo com técnicas baseadas em mindfulness em pacientes com TA, porém já há estudos com resultados positivos em outros TRTOC, como transtorno de escoriação (ARAB; BAGHOULI; BARZEGAR, 2016) , tricotilomania (HEEREN et al., 2015) e transtorno dismórfico corporal (WILHELM et al.,", "Australian and New Zealand Journal of Psychiatry, v. 50, n. 2, p. 128– 134, 2016.

He reported persistent sadness, anhedonia, neurovegetative symptoms and thoughts of suicide.

However, Mrs. B was reluctant to agree with a diagnosis and treatment of OCPD, particularly because she heard from her family members that her overzealousness with money was not a symptom, but rather a feature of her Scottish background.", "CASE 3: Mr. C, an 80 year -old Scandinavian retiree who immigrated to Rio de Janeiro in the 1940’s, was referred to a neurobehavioral clinic for the assessment of memory complai nts.

They are known to aggravate, attenuate, and shape different expressions of mental distress. For instance, in terms of obsessive -compulsive disorder (OCD), a condition at the c entre of the newly developed category of obsessive -compulsive and related disorders, males are known to display an earlier onset and more severe clinical picture, while individuals with OCD hailing from Middle East tend to exhibit more religious concerns.", "1 It is beyond the scope of this chapter to", "address the influence of gender and culture on psychopathology on psychopathology more broadly but rather to provide an overview of their impact on personality, particularly in obsessive -compulsive personality disorder (OCPD). To this end, an initial word of caution is needed. The impact of gender and cultural factors on personality is a sensitive issue, as “stereotypes” always have the potential to confound true clinica l differences between different genders and cultures with pseudoscientific observations and/or mere superficial remarks made by unskilled clinicians who are unable to establish rapports with their clients. 2", "Definitions of sex/gender and culture", "The role that gender and culture play on psychopathology requires a closer collaboration between clinicians and colleagues from th e human sciences, who can provide precise definitions for a more detailed analysis of this topic. 3 Unfortunately, it is surprising that the literature on personality disorders has frequently employed the terms “sex” and “gender” interchangeably, despite their different meanings. 4,5 It is has now been agreed that sex is a determination made through the application of biological criteria (e.g. such as genitalia or chromosomal type) for classifying persons as females or males. 3 By contrast, gender is now widely recognized as “the lived role as boy or girl, man or w oman”. 6 Based on these differences and on the ever increasing importance of gender related issues in modern societies, a recent review has recommended that research on sex/gender correlates of psychopathology to “catego rize” individuals as (a) cisgender females (i.e., biological females who identify as female), (b) cisgender males (i.e., biological males who identify as male), (c) noncisgender females (i.e., transgender females or intersex individuals who identify as fem ale), (d) noncisgender males (i.e., transgender males or intersex individuals who identify as male), and (e) nonbinary/gender -queer (i.e., individuals who do not subscribe to a binary gender identity). 7 Alternatively, scales to assess gender roles (masculinity vs. femininity) could be also employed. 8", "The new DSM -5 outline on cultural formulation includes useful definitions for culture, ethnicity and race. According to DSM -5, culture refers to “systems of knowledge, concepts, rules, and practices that are learned and transmitted across generations”. 6 Cultures have been described as fluid systems that undergo continuous change over time; 6 In a globalized society such as ours, most individuals are exposed to multiple cultures, which may help shape their identities to different extents. 6 Another concept that seems relevant for out discussion is ethnicity , defined", "as a “culturally constructed group identity used to define peoples and communities”. 6 Ethnicity can be based in different factors, including history, geography, language, religion, or other characteristics that distinguish a group from others. 6 Finally, DSM -5 defined race as a “culturally constructed category of identity that divides humanity into groups based on a variety of superficial physical traits attributed to some hypothetical intrinsic, biological chara cteristics”. 6 Importantly, the concept of race has no clear biological meaning, but has supported racism, discrimination, and exclusion, which all have strong negative effects on mental health. 6", "Approaches to gender and culture across DSM editions", "Since the DSM -IV, the role played by sex/gender and culture in the presentation, assessment, treatment and outcome of mental disorders has been given extra attention. 9 This importance was noted 1) in the main DSM -IV text, through a discussion of specific gender, culture, and age and features relevant for the clinical presentations of disorders; and 2) in an appendix, by means of the inclusion of a glossary of culture -bound syndromes and an outline for cultural formulation designed to assist the clinician in sy stematically evaluating and reporting the impact of the individual's cultural context. 9 In DSM -5, this outline has been removed from the appendix and included in a New Section III (on Emerging Measures and Models), thus attesting the increased emphasis given to cultural aspects of mental disorders in the latter manual. This new section also includes the Cultural Formulation Interview (CFI), which has been field- tested for diagnostic usefulness among clinicians and for acceptability among patients.", "6 According to", "the DSM -5, the CFI may be useful in the presence of culturally- related difficulties on: 1) the diagnostic process; 2) the fit between culturally distinctive symptoms and DSM -5 criteria; 3) the assessment of impairment or severity of illness; 4) reaching a consensus with the individual in terms of the course of care; or 5) engagement or adherence to treatment.", "GENDER AND PERSONALITY", "In the seminal meta -analyses by Feingold 10 spanning more than fifty years of research on personality, males were found to be more assertive and had slightly higher self -esteem than females, who were higher in extraversion, anxiety, trust, and, tender -mindedness (e.g., nurturance). His meta -analyses did not find remarkable differences in social anxiety, impulsiveness, activity, ideas (e.g., reflectiveness), locus of control, and orderliness. Of note, these differences were constant across ages, years of data collection, educational levels, and nations. More recently, a study using the Five Factor Model (FFM), which inc ludes Extraversion, Agreeableness, Neuroticism, Conscientiousness, and Openness/Intellect domains, found women to exhibit greater total scores on Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism.", "11 In contrast, in terms of Conscientiousness and Openness/Intellect, differences between genders were restricted to the subdomain levels, i.e. women (particularly at younger ages) scored higher on orderliness and lower on industriousness, and men scored lower on openness and higher on intellect.", "11 Curiously, one study found that people tend to provide more", "varied accounts of personality of males rather than females, with females giving more varied", "descriptions than males. Of note, these effects were stronger in more individualistic societies.", "Feingold also review number of theories have been put forwa rd to explain differences between sexes/genders in terms of personality, including biological (i.e. temperamental) accounts or sociocultural models. 10 In terms of sociocultural models, at least three social theories exist to explain sex/gender dymorphism, i.e. “the social role model” (which suggest that social behaviours stem from gender roles that dictate behaviours that are appropriate for males and females), “the expectancy model” (which suggests that holders of stereotypical beliefs treat others in ways that lead others to conform to the prejudices of the perceivers), and “the artefact model” (according to which differences stem from the importance that people from different sex/gender give to having certain traits, thus affecting self -report responses).", "10 Feingold argued", "that biological and sociocultural reasons are not mutually exclusive and may influences particular moments in the lives of human beings, i.e. biological factors would be more likely to exert more proximal/early influences for being innate, while sociocultural factors would play a greater role d istally/later in life.", "10 However, he fails to mention a number of biological factors", "that have a potential to shape personality traits later in life, such as exposure to hormones during puberty. 13", "GENDER AND PERSONALITY DISORDERS", "The literature consistently shows differences in the prevalence of most “classic” DSM personality disorders across different sex/genders. A recent review 4 showed schizoid, schizotypal , antisocial, narcissistic, and obsessive -compulsive personality disorders to be more commonly reported in males, while borderline, histrionic, and dependent personality disorders to be more frequently diagnosed in females. In DSM -5, an alternative and hybrid personality model including the domains of Negative Affectivity, Detachment, Antagonism, Disinhibition, and Psychoticism (based on the FFM related concepts of Neuroticism, Extroversion, Agreeableness, Conscientiousness and Openness, respectively) has been proposed, also with potential relevance for the study of sex/gender impact in personality disorders. 6,14 According to this new model, personality disorders are perceived as combinations of otherwise “normal” traits that are inflex ible, pervasive, and stable, and which also result in impaired functioning. 14 Studies on the FFM show women to score higher on negative affectivity and lower on antagonism, 10,15,16 findings that are consistent borderline and dependent personality disorders being more prevalent among females. 14 In contrast, lower levels of negative affectivity and greater levels of antagonism in men 10,17 dovetail with studies showing antisocial personality disorder to be more prevalent among males. 14", "A few authors have argued that the diagnostic criteria for personality di sorders, or the ways in which clinicians and researchers use the diagnostic manuals, may bias the diagnosis of these disorders toward a given gender (i.e. the so called criterion or assessment bias, respectively). 14 They contend that these biases also have unwanted consequence in terms of prevalence rates across sex/genders. For instance, it has been suggested that women would be more likely to be", "diagnosed with a dependent personality disorder because the later condition is based on feminine traits (e.g. putting the needs of others ahead of one’s own), which have also been labelled, according to these scholar, as maladaptive. 14 Thus, these definitions have transformed gender into “disorders” at the cost of minimizing women attempt to cope with an “oppressive society”. 14 However, whether these theoretical fragilities represent a threat to the validity of personality disorder constructs or to differences in their prevalence across sexes/genders is questionable. Other traits typically considered masculine (such as dif ficulties in expressing emotions or workaholism ) are not only part of a few personality disorders (e.g. schizotypal personality disorder and OCPD) but also listed as potentially maladaptive. 14", "GENDER AND OCPD", "Despite the clinical and epidemiological importance of OCPD, which has been repeatedly reported as the most common personality disorder in treatment and non- treatment seeking settings (see chapter 2), the literature on the impact of sex/gender in OCPD rema ins sparse. The few existing studies have compared male and female individuals with OCPD in terms of symptom expression, 18 sociodemographic features, 19 comorbidity patterns , 19-21 and underlying neurobiology. 22,23 Moreover, with a few exceptions, 19 these investigations have frequently recruited a small number of subjects and included sex/gender comparisons as les s important, subsidiary analyses. For instance, comparisons between the frequencies that male and female individuals with OCPD endorse different DSM -5 criteria are lacking yet would be very informative. One study suggested that lay people perceive OCPD sym ptoms as being “more pathological” in males. 24 To the best of our knowledge though, the only study that compared OCPD patients from different genders in terms of symptom expression contrasted sixteen female to nine male partic ipants on a scale that assesses drives to analyze variables in a system or to derive its governing rules (i.e. the Systemizing Quotient Scale – Short, SQ -Short). 18 Consistently with previous research in normal controls, 25 men in the OCPD group reported more systemizing than women. Accordingly, the authors speculated that, in contrast to females, interpersonal control among OCPD males may be more related to deriving rules, analyzing, and making predictions about another's behaviour, which is consistent with increased systemizing.", "To date, the biggest study on OCPD addressed its sociodemographic and comorbidity correla tes in 43,093 adults from the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions. 19 This study found that the prevalence of OCPD was 8%, with no significant different rates between men and women (in contrast to studies reviewed above 4). In this study, an OCPD diagnosis was more frequently reported in females from the lowest income strata, females who were married or cohabitating, and females who did not graduate from high school, 19 thus suggesting that OCPD symptoms may be more tolerated or socially acceptable in males from higher income strata, males who are single and males who are high school graduates. In terms of comorbidity, broadly speaking, lifetime and 12- month prevalence of alcohol and drug use disorders and schizoid and antisocial personality disorders were greater among men, whereas depressive and anxiety disorders and paranoid and avoidant personality disorders were more common in women. 19 In contrast, the p revalence of OCPD was higher in females with alcohol and drug use disorders and males with depressive and anxiety disorders. 19 After controlling for", "sociodemographic variables and other psychiatric disorders, only associations of OCPD with alcohol abuse and current mood and anxiety disorders remained significant, but diminished in magnitude. 19", "A Norwegian study with 3,266 consecutive and first admissions, which were assessed for different eating disorders, assigned participants to a specific axis II groups (avoidant, borderline, paranoid, dependent, or obsessive -compulsive disorder) according to a hierarchical system where, in case of comorbid personality disorders, Cluster A diagnoses had a precedence over Clusters B and C, and Cluster B had a hierarchical precedence over Cluster C. In this study, a significant association was found for the co- occurrence of anorexia nervosa and OCPD in females (but not in males). Further, women diagnose d with anorexia nervosa met a significantly higher number of diagnostic criteria for OCPD than women without anorexia nervosa. 20 Another study using data from 700 OCD partic ipants performed a series of multi- level latent class analysis based on comorbid disorders and found a three -class solution. One of the classes, the “OCD co -morbid affective -related”, was characterized by being predominantly female and by having a young age at onset, OCPD features, high scores on the ‘taboo’ factor, and low conscientiousness 21 Although it was somewhat surprising to find OCPD traits and lower conscientiousness in the same class, most conscientiousness items in the instrument used to assess conscientiousness (i.e. the Revised NEO Personality Inventory items) are keyed in the direction of adaptive rather than maladaptive functioning. 26 Taken together, these studies suggest that OCPD in females is related to the presence of mood and anxiety disorders, 19 anorexia nervosa 20 and, in the presence of OCD, by OCPD features. 21", "One study found that male, but not female, OCDP individuals differed from cont rols by showing decreased sympathetic and parasympathetic reactivity as evidenced by decreased levels of salivary amylase and cortisol levels in response to social stress. 22 A different study, in which 374 community individuals were assessed for personality disorders with the International Personality Disorder Examination and were genotyped for the serotonin transporter promoter polymorphism (5HTTLPR), found no relationship between OCPD and 5HTTLPR in unstratified analyses.", "23 However, the variants had opposite effects in male and female OCPD subjects. 23 Male s allele carriers had significantly lower OCPD trait scores whereas female s allele carriers tended to have higher OCPD trait scores. More specifically, the l allele was significantly associated with different OCPD traits in males, particularly perfectionism, reluctance to delegate, and scrupulosity, with all of the remaining traits (with the exception of devotion work) showing trends in the same direction. In contrast, the same seven OCPD traits showed a trend to be associated with the s allele in women. These incipient findings suggest that dysfunction of stress response mechanisms and serotonergic neurotransmission may play a greater role in man with OCPD. Curiously, previous studies also found that s allele in females may increase an individual’s susceptibility to depres sion under stressful life conditions.", "CULTURE AND PERSONALITY Cross -cultural comparisons face problems due to imprecise scale translations, response biases, and unfamiliarity with questionnaires. 27 In general, the study of culture and personality can be", "divided into the universality vs. uniqueness approaches of traits (i.e. the so- called etic/emic distinction), which correspond to the transportation of personality measures across cultures (the etic approach) and the identification of indigenous dimensions (the emic approach), respectively. 28 Under the etic approach (derived from the term phon etic, i.e. the study of universal sounds in all languages), researchers have tested and successfully demonstrated the cross -cultura l factor replicability of the FFM in up to 50 cultures. 29 Curiously, studies on FFM across cultures have shown Australians and New Zealanders, Burkinabé and Batswana, Germans and Austrians, Americans and Canadians, and Hong Kong and Taiwan Chinese to have similar profiles. 27 However, cross -cultural studies found it particularly difficult to replicate the FFM in less educated or preliterate grou ps, such as the Mooré in Burkina Faso or forager- farmers in Bolivia. 28 In contrast to the etic , the emic approach (from the term phonemics , i.e. the study of the unique or language -specific meanings associated with particular sounds) is based on native languages and cultural informants to identify culture -specific personality constructs. The emic has allowed replication of the FFM in some, but not all (e.g. Hindi) cultures.", "Another important issue in terms of the relationship between culture and personality is the mediating role or sex/gender 15,30 and socioeconomic status. 30 As discussed on the section on gender and personality, males and females show consistent differences in terms of personality traits across a range of instruments. Social role theorists have argued that these differences reflect merely reflect perceived gender roles, gender socialization and sociostructural power differentials. Surprisingly though, the available evidence suggests that these differences in are conspicuously larger in cultures with more egalitarian gender roles, gender socialization and socio political gender equity. 30 Potential reasons for this amplification include the fact that, in egalitarian society, certain behaviours (e.g. kindness) are more likely to be described as personality traits (e.g. agreeableness) rather than societal norms. Further, given different socioeconomic conditions of people living in the first vs. third world countries and the well - known impact of socioeconomic status on personality, it would be interesting to assess how culture and socioeconomic status interact to generate specific personality patterns.", "CULTURE AND PERSONALITY DISORDERS The relationship between personality and culture, particularly in terms of Western vs. Non - Western comparisons, has provided interesting insights. Arguably, in Western cultures, the self is generally considered an “object” separate from the world, located in an inner compartment, and comprised of distinctive habits, emotions, behaviours, intentions, and conflicts.", "31 In", "contrast, selves in non -Western societies have been descr ibed as being more “sociocentric”, with individuals describing feeling more connected to other persons and social institutions. 31 Further, while in western societies, disordered personalities tend t o be perceived as medical conditions that warrant evidence -based treatments by psychiatrists or psychologists based on scientific evidence, in non -Western cultures, personality problems are most likely considered to be poor personal choices put into practi ce by an exercise of free will and remediated by civil, familial, or spiritual measures. 31 Clearly, the delineations of concepts of normality vs. abnormality, including the existence of personality problems as an illness (or disorder), have", "been calibrated in terms of Western norms. 31 That said, it is still unclear whether differences in prevalence rates of different personality disorders across diverse cultures reflect in part, a biological phenomena (linked, for instance, to the specific genetic makeup of a specific ethnic group) or simply an artefact of societies that tolerate more or less certain types of behaviours, thus decreasing or incr easing caseness, respectively.", "The DSM -5 tried its best to make the diagnosis of personality disorders culture -free. It defined a personality disorder as an “enduring pattern of inner experience and behavior that deviates markedly from the expectations of the individual's culture , is pervasive and inflexible, has an onset in adolescence or early adulthood, is stable over time, and leads to distress or impairment”.", "Still, it seems difficult to dissociate cultural influences in personality disorders. For instance, there is reasonable evidence that the “goodness of fit” or “personality -culture clash” hypotheses between an individual’s personality style and his or her society is associated with self -reported psychological distress, with pot ential diagnosis consequences for personality disorders. 31 Much of the research on the impact of culture in personality disorders has considered the differences between collectivistic and individual istic cultures. For instance, in collectivistic cultures group membership is a central aspect of identity, and valued personal traits reflect the goals of collectivism.", "31 Life satisfaction derives f rom successfully carrying out social roles and", "obligations. Restraint in emotional expression to promote in- group harmony is valued. 31 In contrast, individualism supports open emotional expression a nd striving to attain personal goals, traits deemed potentially inappropriate in collectivistic cultures. 31 The fact that immigration seems to be associated with increasing rates of personality diso rders supports goodness of fit/personality- clash hypothesis. So is the fact that shy and unsociable individuals in collectivistic countries (e.g. Korea) tend to show better social and emotional adjustment than individuals with similar characteristics in an individualistic country (e.g. Australia) 34 and that socially withdrawn was seen as well behaved and easily accep ted by the their peers. 35 It is unclear whether the differences between collectivistic vs. individualistic cultures are relevant for OCPD diagnosis.", "CULTURE AND OCPD", "As exposed in the introduction on culturally related- terminology, studies on racial aspects of personality do not seem to be very useful for the practicing physician for being frequently biased and performed on a superficial basis, 36 and for having potentially harmful consequences (see 37 for a relevant discussi on on OCD). Although the concept of ethnicity is probably more useful, both for research and for clinical practice, the fact that these terms have been used interchangeably makes existing studies difficult to interpret. For instance, in the National Epidem iological Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions described above, OCPD was found to be significantly less common among “Asians or Pacific Islanders” and “Hispanics” relative to “Whites”. 19,38 These differences were also reported in the male and female subsamples separately but, in the male subsamples, “Blacks” were also less likely to have OCPD than “Whites”. 19 This study also found that increased rates of OCPD in Northeast and South compared to the Midwest or West United States. The fact that these relationships were not reported in a in a clinical sample is noteworthy. 39 Finally, in a study with a “Hispanic” outpatient sample, a two -factor solution - perfectionism and interpersonal rigidity, replicated findings previously reported in previous studies in “European” samples. 40", "In an early review on OCPD, Pollak argued that “Many of the OCPD traits (e.g. “perseverance, industriousness, thriftiness, ambition, self -control, and so on), are highly regard and rewarded within capitalistic, technological societies, serve to promote in their possessors feelings of self - worth and acceptability, and generally provide them with a foundation for emotional stability and relative resistance to stress”.", "41 Almost 40 years after his review, the impact of cultural", "factors in OCPD remains elusive and poorly studied. It is possible, however, to use the personality- culture clash hypothesis to make a number of predictions about the role of culture in DSM -5 OCPD. These predictions, which we briefly outline below, are based on the definition of OCPD in DSM -5 as a pervasive pattern of preoccupation with orderliness, perfectionism, and mental and interpersonal control, at the expense of flexibility, openness, and efficiency, beginning by early adulthood and present in a variety of contexts.", "For instance, preoccupation with orderliness (including details, rules, order, organization, or schedules) 6 or perfectionism (e.g. “strict standards”) 6 seem to characterize first vs. third world countries. Thus, one can speculate that individuals high on such traits would be more likely to experi ence distress, and therefore to be diagnosed with OCPD in disorderly or chaotic societies. Similarly, excessive mental control, 6 exemplified by over conscientiousness, scrupulousity, and inflexibility about matters of morality, ethics, or values, 6 seem to be particularly prominent in very religious (e.g. middle -eastern) countries, suggesting that individuals raised in these societies would be probably be more likely to be diagnosed wi th OCPD in more secular societies. Individuals showing high interpersonal control traits for imposing their ways of doing things on others would be more likely to have this feature described as a symptom in societies that are less authoritarian, with more democratic values. A miserly spending style, where money is viewed as something to be hoarded for future catastrophes, seem to be more likely to be seen in individuals who hail from less developed countries or societies characterized by political and econo mic instabilities.", "Other aspects of OCPD that do not represent criteria, but are nevertheless included in the DSM -", "5 text for OCPD include the fact that individuals with OCPD may be preoccupied with", "“dominance -submiss ion relationships” and may display excessive deference to an authority they respect. 6 Though not representing core symptoms, these features can be part of the latent OCPD construct. Accordingly, one can speculate that e astern cultures that typically emphasize hierarchy, e.g. as respect for older individuals, would be more likely to exhibit lower prevalence of OCPD. Alternatively, OCPD individuals who enter in the military may be less inclined to experience distress or dy sfunction as compared to individuals with other personality disorders on a similar capacity. The DSM -5 text also describes the highly controlled or stilted affection (as in “affective isolation” or “reaction formation” mechanisms of defences, respectively) 42 and the discomfort individuals with OCPD may show in the presence of others who are emotionally expressive. 6 As collectivistic cultures seem to be less tolerant of deviance (e.g. inflexibility) and tend to promote behavioral patterns charact erized by inhibition and constriction of emotion (affect isolation), one can speculate that individuals hailing from eastern cultures would be more likely to be diagnosed with OCPD in modern individualistic societies, which values flexibility and less secure social roles.", "INTEGRATION OF CASE VIGNETTES AND EXISTING LITERATURE", "The case vignettes included in this chapter illustrate how information on gender and culture may be interfere positively or negatively with the appropriate diagnosis and/or management of individuals with obsessive -compulsive personality disorder (OCPD). In case 1, the diagnosis of OCPD is missed in a wealthy, single and educated male, in whom OCPD traits have been described to be more socially acceptable. Case 2 exemplifies h ow unfounded stereotypes and stigma can interfere negatively with the appropriate treatment adherence of an OCPD patient. In the subsequent cases, it is possible to note that clinicians can raise appropriate (case 3) or inappropriate (case 4) diagnostic questions based on consistent cultural differences.", "TAKE HOME POINTS", "• Both sex/gender and culture/ethnicity represent neglected variables in OCPD studies.", "• Research findings suggest sex/gender can impact clinical expression, comorbidity findings, and neurobiological variables in OCPD.", "• Despite being less well studied, it is possible to make several testable predictions in terms of the impact of culture/ethnicity in OCPD.", "REFERENCES", "1.

At follow-up, the majority of responderswho had abstained from further ECT hadexperienced relapse. However, a positive responsewas obtained in all participants who received a newcourse of ECT. Patients who responded positively toECT were likely to report previous unsuccessfultreatment with antipsychotics ( P < .001) and antidepressants ( P = .007).", "Conclusions: The finding that more than 70% of the reviewed cases showed some response to ECTshould not be considered unequivocal evidence of itsefficacy in OCRDs. The available evidence suggeststhat a randomized controlled trial of ECT in OCRDsmay be warranted, particularly in severe tic disordersand self-injurious behaviors. Prim Care Companion CNS Disord APÊNDICE B ERP) suggests that ECT could have been avoided if patients were treated more conservatively.9 In addition to insufficient evidence supporting the use of ECT in OCD, it is still unclearwhether ECT may be helpful in those affected by obsessive-compulsive–related disorders(OCRDs) other than OCD. In DSM-5 , OCRDs include body dysmorphic disorder, hoardingdisorder, trichotillomania (hair-pulling disorder), and excoriation d isorder (skin-picking disorder) among others.1 Further, despite not being officially recognized asOCRDs in DSM-5 , some neurodevelopmental disordershave been considered part of an “extended” OCD spectrum on thebasis of clinical and biological commonalities with OCD behaviors, including tic disorders and Tourette’s disorder, autism spectrum disorders, and stereotypic movementdisorders such as s elf-injurious b ehaviors.10 These neurodevelopmental conditions have been noted to co-occur with each other and to be overrepresented among early onset OCD cases.11–13 In contrast to OCD patients, for whom the usefulness of ECT remains elusive, there is good reason to suspect that OCRDs may be responsive to ECT.First, body dysmorphic disorder and hoarding disorder are frequently delusional 14,15 and associated with g reater severity of depression.15,16 Second, symptoms of catatonia (the quintessential “ECT-responsive” neuropsychiatricdisorder) overlap substantially with tic disorders and Tourette’s disorder (eg, echopraxia and echolalia, staring, and grimacing), autism19–21 (eg, negativism, mutism/verbigeration, and stereotypies/mannerisms), and self-injurious behaviors 22 (eg, impulsivity and aggressiveness). Also, b oth cognitive23,24 and motor OCRDs25–28 can reach extreme levels of severity, occasionally involving life-threatening behaviors that can result in severe tegumentary lesions,23 trichobezoars (mass of hairs blocking the bowel),25 or even sepsis, thus prompting clinicians to consider ECT for some forms of OCRDs.", "Despite the reasons for predicting positive responses of OCRD cases to ECT, there also have been negative e xperiences. For instance, Kalinowsky and Hippius29 noted that tic disorder patients who “learned” to suppress tics might be unable to do so and deteriorate as a consequence of the detrimental effects of ECT on their ability to focus attention. Worsening of OCD after ECT hasbeen reported in a few cases,", "8 but it is unclear whether a similar phenomenon", "occurs in other OCRDs. To shed light on thi s p oorly understood phenomenon and its treatment, we systematically reviewed studies reporting the effect of ECT in individuals with an official DSM-5 diagnosis of an OCRD, including body dysmorphic disorder, hoarding disorder, trichotillomania, and excoriationdisorder, as well as conditions under an “extended” OCD spectrum including tic disorders, autism spectrum disorders, and self-injurious behavio rs.

Maintenance electroconvulsive therapy in obsessive-compulsive–related disorders may bewarranted, particularly in casesshowing more severe tic disordersand self-injurious behaviors, dueto the high relapse rate.2. How do baseline features of OCRD patients who respond to ECT differ from OCRD patients who do not respond to ECT?", "METHODS Study Selection Criteria Type of studies. We searched for randomized controlled t rials (RCTs), observational studies,retrospective investigations,case series, and single casereports describing ECTeffects on the core repetitivebehaviors across the fullrange of DSM-5 OCRDs (ie, body dysmorphic disorder,hoarding disorder,trichotillomania, andexcoriation disorder), as well as tic disorders, autism spectrum disorders, self-injurious behaviors,kleptomania, and pyromania. Studies that, d espite including the targeted populations, reported just the effects of ECT on other syndromes or behaviors (ie, depression in autism spectrum disorders) were preliminarily excluded fromour research protocol. Editorials, letters, and reviews were included if sufficiently detailed original data were provided.", "Types of ECT interventions. We selected all studies reporting the use of modified, unmodified , m ultiple-monitored, bilateral, and unilateral ECT with any dose, frequency, or level of stimulus. Studies that reported individuals receiving ECT who were also under current or previous pharmacologic treatments (eg, SRIs and antipsychotics) or different forms of psychotherapy(including cognitive-behavioral therapy [CBT] such as ERP, habit reversal, or behavior modification) were also included. Studi es d escribing individuals treated with other brain stimulation techniques such as transcranial magneticstimulation (TMS), transcranial direct-current stimulation (tDCS), deep brain stimulation (BDS), and vagus nerve stimulation were also included if the patients’ response to ECT was also reported.", "Type of measures. Given the dearth of instruments employed across and within the target disorders of our r eview, the primary outcome of interest was the authors’ categorical description of clinically meaningful benefits of ECTon repetitive behaviors that characterize DSM-5 OCRDs and the extended OCD spectrum. However, we were also interested in evaluating how frequentlyreports of ECT use in broadly defined OCRDs described valid instruments for the assessment of severity of repetitive behaviors in each di sorder o f interest (including, but not restricted to, the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale[YBOCS] modified for body dysmorphic disorder,", "31 the YBOCS modified for", "neurotic excoriation,32 the Saving Inventory-Revised,33 the Massachusetts General Hospital Hairpulling Scale,34,35 the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale,36 and the Children’s Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale modified for autism spectrum disor ders37 among others38).", "Search Methods for Identification of Studies Electronic searching. A systematic search was performed between June 6 and July 2, 2017, in the following databases: MEDLINE, Web of Science, Scopus, and LILACS. The keywords used for the search are listed in Table 1. Other sources. The reference lists of studies that fulfilled inclusion criteria and textbooks deemed relevant for our research question29,39–45 were also examined for possible new studies. Further, complete and in-progress clinical trials still not published in clinicaltrials.gov and WHO clinical trials registry platforms were also considered for inclusion. No search restrictions (eg, date, language, or doc ument type) were used.", "D ata Collection and Analysis Selection of studies. Repeated titles across databases were removed, and the remaining articles were checked and analyzed individually by our team, which comprised 2 psychiatrists (L.F.F. and J.N.Q.), 2 biomedical scientists (S.S.R. and J.B.S.A.), and 1 psychology student (K.B.B.). During weekly meetings that took place between June 2017 and February 2 018, t itles and abstracts were analyzed to exclude articles that clearly did not meet the inclusion criteria; then, the full text of selected articles was read for extraction of the data of interest. Eligibility was defined according to inclusion and exclusion criteria for each diagnostic group. When doubts or disagreement between authors regarding the characteristics of the collected variables occurred , a consensus was reached. If the doubts persisted, then corresponding authors of the articles in question were contacted for clarification. If noresponse was obtained, than the study was excluded from the analysis. Data management. The authors of this review conducted the entire process. If a study fulfilled all of the criteria for inclusion, then its information was entered into a SPSS file (SPSS In c, C hicago, Illinois). We evaluated experimental and group studies and individual cases. In terms of experimentaland group studies, we specifically selected RCTs, the quality of which weplanned to assess according to Cochrane criteria", "46 including (1) random", "sequence generation; (2) allocation concealment; (3) blinding of participants, personnel, and outcome assessors; (4) selective reporting; and (5) incomplete o utcome data. In terms of individual cases, whenever possible, demographic and clinical data, alleged indications for ECT use, treatment history before ECT administration, information related to ECT, and clinical efficacy(including follow-up) were collected. Relevant demographic and clinical data included age, sex, age at OCRD symptom onset, target diagnosis, patterns of comorbidities (eg, OCD/obsessive-compulsive s ymptoms, other OCRDs, major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, or schizophrenia), and whether patients were examined with valid assessment tools. Possible indications for ECT werecategorized into OCRDs secondary to other conditions known to be treatable with ECT (eg, depression); treatment-resistant OCRDs; severe OCRDs (ie, conditions resulting in self-injury or risks for pa tients’ p hysical health); severe major depressive disorder with suicidality or psychosis; catatonia; severe mania, psychosis, or agitation; previous response to ECT or seizures; and thepresence of drug side effects or other indications. We also collected data on individuals’ treatment history including previous use of SRIs, antipsychotics, any form of psychotherapy, and concomitant use of antidepressan ts a nd psychotherapy during ECT. Information on ECT parameters such as type of electrode placement (unilateral or bilateral), totalnumber of ECT sessions, and weekly frequency of administration was alsoregistered. Finally, data related to patterns of ECT response were collected, including positive versus negative response of OCRDs or associated depression to ECT, whether this response was based on a valid assessment tool or simply the authors’ subjective clinical impression, whether patients have been followed up (reassessed) in the absence of ECT use, whether there was a relapse during follow-up, whether a second course of ECT was required, and,if a second course of ECT was required, whether the patient responded. S tatistical analysis. As previously reported,9 a priori analyses of ECT responders versus nonresponders were planned on the basis of the following variables: age, sex, age at OCRD symptom onset, main OCRD, course of illness, major comorbidities, previous exposure to SRIs or antipsychotics, previous psychotherapy (including CBT), indication for ECT, and number of diff erent indications for ECT. Categorical variables were described infrequencies and compared using χ", "2 square and Fisher exact test, and continuous", "variables were compared using the Mann-Whitney U test. Correction for multiple comparisons was performed using the Benjamini-Hochberg test47 with a false discovery rate set at 0.25.", "RESULTS The search resulted in 833 articles, of which 384 represented repeated references.

A total of 69 OCRD individuals were treated with ECT, of whom 69.2% presented self-injurious behaviors of different etiologies (autism spectrum disorders, tic disorders or Tourette’s disorder, and delusions), 35.4% Tourette’s disorder or tics (not explicitly involving self-injurious behaviors), 13% body dysmorphic disorder, and 2% trichotillomania (see patient features in Table 2).", "The f inal s ample included 64 patients for whom it was possible to establish a positive response to ECT, which was observed in 73.4% of the total cases, including 44.0% of the body dysmorphic disorder, 74.1% of the tic disorder, and 85.7% of the self-injurious behavior patients. Nevertheless, only 12 (17.4%) cases had formal assessments of the severity of their OCRDs before and after the treatment. Further, follow-up w as described in only 27 individuals (39.1%), ranging from 1 week to 48 months. Although relapse was noted in more than half (55.6%) of individuals who were followed up, positive responses were reported in all individuals (n = 12) who received a secondcourse of ECT. We could establish the stimulus electrode placement in 45 OCRD cases: ECT was bilateral in 36 (80.0%), unilateral in 6 (13.3%), and unilateral followed by bilateral or vice versa in 3 (6.7%) patients. In 24 cases, mode of ECT placement was unclear. The mean (SD) number of ECT sessions administered in the first course of ECT, based on a total of 51 available cases, was 11.27 (5.73). Frequency of ECT adm inistration w as established in 21 patients. The mean (SD) number of ECT sessions per week was initially 2.95 (0.50). There was a reduction in the frequency of ECT in the first treatment course in 20 (37.0%) cases.", "Individuals who did and did not respond to ECT were compared and contrasted (Table 3). Groups did not differ in terms of age, sex, age at OCRD onset, course and pattern of comorbidity, indicat ion f or ECT, electrode placement, total number of sessions, and frequency of administration. However, there was a trend for higher frequency of self-injurious behaviors between responders ( P = .08). Articles describing ECT responders were more likely to report previous unsuccessful treatment with antipsychotics ( P < .001), SRIs ( P = .007), and CBT (P = .05). However, after the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure was applied, only differences in antipsychotic and SRI exposure remained significant. Publication bias was investigated by comparing thepositive responses described in case reports (68.1%) to those reported in case series (n > 1) (31.9%), but no significant differences emerged (χ DISCUSSION In this systematic review, we were unable to find any RCT on the use of ECT in OCRD patients. As such, it is not possible to provide unequivocal evidence of the efficacy of ECT in this group of individuals. Although a positive response was reported in 73.4% of published patients, all records were1 case reports and series, whose ability to provide reliable evidence of treatment benefits are generally undermined by a high probability of selection, information, and, frequently, publication biases.102,103 Accordingly, case reports and series lie at the penultimate level in the hierarchy of evidence of treatment benefits, being only superior to mechanistic reasoning.104 However, reviews of such cases have been r eported as alternative “clinician-friendly methods” to test hypothetical therapeutic models.103,105 This theory is consistent with the finding that up to 22% of cases published in a high-impact journal have beenfollowed by trials after a period of sometimes only 5 years.", "106 Thus, the", "available evidence does suggest that an RCT of ECT in OCRDs may be warranted, particularly in more severe tic disorder and s elf-injurious behavior cases.", "We also found that less than 40% of all OCRD patients treated with ECT were evaluated after administration of the index course of ECT (ie, followed up). However, when these follow-up assessments were reported, relapses were noted in more than half of individuals. Similarly high rates of post-ECT relapsein the first year have been described in depression (51% in 1 year )", "107 and", "schizophrenia (42.7 to 63.6%).108,109 Fortunately, all OCRD individuals who relapsed responded favorably to a repeated course of ECT. High relapse ratescoupled with prompt remission after treatment resumption are consistent with an ability of ECT to keep symptoms suppressed until spontaneous remission occurs.", "110 As many OCRDs follow a chronic course, future studies should", "examine the role of maintenan ce E CT in this specific population. Maintenance ECT has been used safely for up to 12 years111 and proved effective in depression,112,113 bipolar disorder,114 and schizophrenia.115 However, the cost of sessions and concerns of patients and families about the side effects ofprolonged ECT may contribute to withdrawal and discontinuation of maintenance ECT.", "Although ECT responders and nonresponders did not diff er in most parameters, there was a trend for higher frequency of self-injurious behaviors and greater exposure to unsuccessful trials with antipsychotics and SRIsamong the former group. These findings are in sharp contrast to our previous review, 8 in which ECT responders were less likely to have been treated with SRIs or CBT in the past. It is difficult to speculate on the significance of these findings, b ut they suggest that either (1) ECT is more effective as an augmentation strategy for patients under existing anti-OCRD treatments compared to patients who are not using antipsychotics or SRIs or (2) authors who describe response of OCRD patients to ECT are more likely to emphasizeor report previous resistance to antipsychotics or SRIs. We tend to favor thesecond interpretation, as it may be diff icult to support the use of ECT in an atypical population that is not usually seen as responsive to ECT. Our study has a number of limitations. First, it partly consisted of an analysis of individual cases of OCRDs treated with ECT as reported in theliterature, which are subject to missing data. Second, reviewed cases compriseda heterogeneous sample with self-injurious behaviors (69.2%), tic diso rders a nd Tourette’s disorder (35.4%), body dysmorphic disorder (13%), and trichotillomania (2%). However, our study should be considered consistentwith contemporary models (eg, Research Domain Criteria) suggesting thatOCRDs may respond to treatments that cut across traditional diagnosticboundaries. Third, only 12 (17.4%) cases had formal assessments of severity, and no transdiagnostic measure of eff icacy w as available, so we had to rely on authors’ descriptions of treatment response to report efficacy and compare responders to nonresponders. Finally, although it would be interesting to investigate whether risk factors for relapse reflect features related to theunderlying OCRD or the initial ECT course,", "117 low numbers precluded us from", "comparing patients that did versus did not relapse.", "CONCLUSIONS The finding t hat more than 70% of the reviewed cases (including body dysmorphic disorder, tic disorders, autism, and self-injurious behaviors) have shown some response to ECT should not be considered unequivocal evidence of its efficacy in OCRDs. The primary limitation to forming any firm conclusions is that there is currently a total lack of RCTs on the efficacy of ECT in different OCRDs. An additional limitation is that there is an absence of valid transdiagnostic tools for the assessment of treatment response across different OCRDs. Nonetheless, the available evidence does suggest that anRCT of ECT in OCRDs may be warranted, particularly in more severe tic disorders and self-injurio us b ehavior cases in which maintenance ECT may be advisable due to the high relapse rate. The reported association between OCRDresponse to ECT and previous treatment with antipsychotics and antidepressants suggests that either (1) ECT is more effective as an augmentation strategy for existing anti-OCRD treatments or (2) authors who describe response to ECT are more likely to emphasize or report previo us r esistance to antipsychotics or antidepressants.", "Submitted: June 16, 2018; accepted August 7, 2018.", "Published online: October 18, 2018.", "Potential conflicts of interest: None.", "Funding/support: This work was supported by Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico (Dr Fontenelle, grant no. 308237/2014-5), Fundação Carlos Chagas Filho de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado do Rio de Janeiro (Dr Fontenelle), the D’Or Institute of Research and Education (Dr Fontenelle), theDavid Winston Turner Endowment Fund (Drs Fontenelle and Yücel); and the National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia (Dr Yücel, grant no.

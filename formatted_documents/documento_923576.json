However, this is what many of us have been doing via Uber and Airbnb, two of the most popular sharing economy platforms. To make these transactions possible, trust is crucial. However, the literature on how trust is built in t his context is scattered. While most authors investigated it from the perspective of demanders toward suppliers, others focused on the perspective of demanders toward platforms, suppliers toward demanders, or suppliers toward platforms. Furthermore, the sh aring economy is not a homogeneous phenomenon, and prior studies focused on specific platforms.", "Therefore, the overall objective of this doctoral dissertation is to explain how trust is formed in sharing economy transactions, considering multiple trust -building perspectives and different platforms.

The software worked as a digital intermedia ry, connect ing people who wanted their cars to be cleaned and self - employed washers who wanted to offer their services. The initiative had some early successes, but did not thrive due to the lack of trust , among other reasons . Later, I realized that my ini tiative had belong ed to a growing phenomenon known as sharing economy.", "Although t he term s haring economy lacks a common definition , Uber and Airbnb are widely cited as two of its most prominent examples , and their success depends heavily on trust. In 2020 alone , Uber arranged five billion trips and operated in approximately 10,000 cities. And since 2007, Airbnb has grown to four million hosts , who have welcomed over 800 million guest arrivals to approximately 100,000 cities. Such success would be unlikely if Uber and Airbnb were not able to facilitate trust.", "Indeed, p rior studies have pointed out the key role of trust , and explored its antecedents to explain how it is formed in the context of the sharing economy, but these studies have been scattered . Most of them focused on demanders toward suppliers, or demanders toward platforms. In addition, despite the heterogeneity of sharing economy platforms, most studies only considered Airbnb or Uber contexts .", "The general objective of this research is to explain how trust is built in sharing economy transactions , considering multiple trust -building perspectives and different platforms. To achieve the referred goal, this research was performed in three steps, each one producing a corresponding article .", "Initially, i t was necessary to define what sharing economy really is and identify its different categories. Therefore, t he first study used a broad taxonomic approach to develop a classification of platforms at work in the sharing economy. It systematically selected 42 initiatives and analyzed their business attributes . In the end, five platform categories were identified : commodity intermediar ies, wealth redistributor s, unique -service intermediar ies, skill redistributor s, and decentralized commodity intermediar ies. A version of th e study was published in Australasian Marketing Journal in June 2020.", "The second study used a systematic literature review to develop an integrated and parsimonious model to explain the formation of trust in the context of the sharing economy . It 16 identified 142 perspective -specific antecedents of trust , and group ed them into eight high-level constructs applicable to multiple trust -building perspectives and platform categories. A version of th e study was presented in Brazil , at the 2021st edition of the Encontro da Associação Nacional de Pós -Graduação e Pesquisa em Administração , and received an honorable mention in the category of best article derived from a doctoral dissertation, in the Digital Marketing and Innovation theme .", "In the third stu dy, the proposed model matured and was tested using structural equation modeling . In its final version , the model was constituted by four independent variables related to the cues a person uses to infer their counterpart’s trustworthiness, three independen t variables related to the reasons the person has for engaging in sharing economy transactions, and Trust as the dependent variable . Furthermore , the relationship s between the independent and dependent variables were moderated by the person ’s propensity to trust. The model was tested using a survey to collect data from a sample of 351 respondents and structural equation modeling to analyz e them . The test provided evidence that Third -Party Evaluation, First -Party Interaction, and Social Motivation do have a significant role in driving Trust , and that the strength of these effects is moderated by the respondent's Propensity to Trust. A version of the study has been accepted for presentation at the 82nd Annual Meeting of the Academy of Management .", "In the end, these three studies complement each other and contribute to explain how trust is built in sharing economy transactions . Taking th e proposed model as a knowledge base, several guidelines for future research and implications for practitioners are provided .", "1ST STUDY: A TAXONOMY OF INITIATIVES AT WORK IN THE SHARING ECONOMY", "18 1. A taxonomy of initiatives at work in the s haring economy", "Abstract", "It is crucial to classify SE initiatives to better understand such a multifaceted phenome non. However, previous attempts to classify SE initiatives seem not to contemplate the full SE complexity. Therefore, this study proposes a new classification using a broad taxonomic approach. It started by systematically selecting a set of initiatives. Th en, an intensive search on secondary data about the initiatives selected was conducted in order to identify relevant attributes. Next, the attributes identified were successively aggregated resulting in four attribute groups. In the end, each initiative wa s analysed from the perspective of each attribute group, resulting in five SE categories: commodity intermediary, wealth redistributor, unique - service intermediary, skill redistributor, and decentralized commodity intermediary. Findings suggest that genera lizations from studies focused on specific initiatives might be problematic, entrepreneurs should consider the characteristics of different SE categories to design appropriate platforms, and policymakers should avoid regulating all SE initiatives in a homo geneous manner.", "Keywords: sharing economy ; peer -to-peer platforms; digital platform; taxonomy.", "1.1. Introduction", "The term Sharing Economy (SE) lacks a common definition (Cheng, 2016; Kumar , Lahiri & Bahadir , 2018; Muñoz & Cohen, 2017; Parente , Geleilate & R ong, 2018) and often encompasses a broad variety of concepts (Hawlitschek , Teubner & Gimpel, 2018), but it is usually associated with transactions mediated by digital platforms between people who have idle resources on the supply side and people who want t o use those resources on the demand side (Fang , Ye & Law, 2016; Fuentes -Bracamontes, 2016; Mair & Reischauer, 2017; Parente et al., 2018). This study adopts the following SE definition: “a web of markets in which individuals use various forms of compensati on to transact the redistribution of and access to 19 resources, mediated by a digital platform operated by an organisation” (Mair & Reischauer, 2017, p. 12). Airbnb, a digital platform that mediates accommodation rentals between hosts and guests, is one of t he most prominent SE initiatives.", "The increasing importance of SE is related to the diffusion of the Internet and digitally enabled tools, which have made production processes more available to private individuals (Rayna & Striukova, 2016). SE initiatives are expected to increase their global revenues from USD 15 billion in 2014 to USD 335 billion by 2025 (PWC, 2015).", "Individual and social factors drive people’s engagement with SE. Among individual factors, major appeals include income expectation (Alrawa dieh & Alrawadieh, 2018), cost savings expectation (Hawlitschek et al., 2018b; Milanova & Maas, 2017; Pappas, 2017; Tussyadiah, 2016; Tussyadiah & Pesonen, 2018; Wu , Zeng & Xie, 2017), access to authentic or unique experiences (Guttentag , Smith, Potwarka & Havitz, 2018; Mao & Lyu, 2017; Morrison , Paulauskaite, Powell & Stefaniak, 2017), and enjoyment expectation (Hwang & Griffiths, 2017; Kam , So, Oh & Min, 2018; Tussyadiah, 2016).", "As for social factors, a sense of belonging to a community (Hawlitschek et al., 2018b; Milanova & Maas, 2017) and cultural exchange expectation (Alrawadieh & Alrawadieh, 2018; Morrison et al., 2017) are major drivers.", "There is no consensus regarding environmental concerns. While some studies provide evidence that environmental c oncerns drive people’s engagement toward SE (Hawlitschek et al., 2018b; Hwang & Griffiths, 2017), other studies suggest that even though SE initiatives may promote a more sustainable use of resources by favouring access over ownership, this is considered o nly a positive side effect by SE users (Hartl , Sabitzer, Hofmann & Penz, 2018). When engaging in SE, an individual usually transacts with a stranger, which involves risk and uncertainty, so trust plays a crucial and complex role (Hawlitschek , Notheisen & Teubner, 2018). Therefore, SE initiatives should provide not only the infrastructure to put supply side and demand side in contact with each other, but also services such as insurance and reputation mechanisms to establish and maintain trust among SE user s (Katz, 2015; Teubner , Hawlitschek & Dann, 2017).", "The rise of SE challenges incumbent businesses, policymakers, and society as a whole, which have been discussing upsides and downsides of this phenomenon. Implications of labour conditions, consumer prote ction, and regulation are at the top of the agenda (Parente et al., 2018). However, considering the increasing diversity of SE initiatives, it is reasonable to 20 suppose that factors driving people’s engagement, mechanisms raising trust among users, and implications for businesses, policymakers, and society may vary from initiative to initiative. Therefore, it is crucial to classify SE initiatives to better discuss the characteristics and implications of this phenomenon.", "An extensive research about attempts to classify SE initiatives on peer -reviewed literature showed that some focused on specific sectors such as mobility (Cohen & Kietzmann, 2014) or specific initiative types such as marketplaces (Täusher & Laudien, 2018), not considering the full spectrum of SE initiatives. Other studies used conceptual approaches such as typologies (Cohen & Muõz, 2016; Muñoz & Cohen, 2017). However, conceptual axes picked a priori to develop typologies seem not to contemplate the entire SE complexity, especially when those c onceptual axes are derived from the literature. Considering that SE is an emerging phenomenon, previous literature may be focused on the most well -known SE initiatives (e.g. Airbnb and Uber). Therefore, although previous studies are useful, there is still a gap for classifications using broad empirical approaches.", "In order to fill this gap, the purpose of this study is to develop a broad empirical approach to classify SE initiatives. Understanding different categories may be an important input for scholars to evaluate generalizations of findings in SE literature as well as to design future studies. Besides, platform managers may consider these categories to design customized reputation mechanisms and pricing systems, while policymakers may consider these ca tegories to develop specific regulations.", "This study is structured as follows. Section 1.2 contains a literature review on previous attempts to classify SE initiatives, highlighting the lack for broad empirical classifications and resulting in the resear ch question to be addressed. Section 1.3 contains a detailed description of how this research was conducted to address the research question. Emergent categories are introduced and discussed in section 1.4. The paper concludes by discussing the implication s of this study for scholars, managers, and policymakers.", "1.2. Previous attempts to classify SE initiatives", "The expression “SE” was searched within titles, abstracts, and keywords of Business, Management, and Accounting articles on the Scopus database. Artic les from first -quartile journals according to the SCImago Journal Rank Indicator 2017 were filtered resulting in 164 21 articles from 55 journals being analysed. Two streams of attempts to classify the different SE initiatives were identified.", "In the first s tream identified, researchers suggested classifications focused on specific sectors or specific initiative types. For example, some studies applied concepts derived from literature to develop classifications comprising major business model types within car sharing, ride sharing, and bike sharing (Cohen & Kietzmann, 2014) or distinguishable categories of marketplace business models (Täusher & Laudien, 2018). Other studies performed content analysis of the data collected on the websites of selected initiative s to classify types of crowd logistics services (Carbone , Rouquet & Roussat, 2017) or types of SE initiatives involving physical flows ( Carbone, Rouquet & Roussat, 2018). Although useful, studies following this stream focused on specific sectors or specifi c initiative types such as mobility or marketplaces, not considering the full spectrum of SE initiatives.", "In the second stream, researchers suggested broad classifications relying on conceptual approaches. Cohen and Munõz (2016) focused on two analytical dimensions that considered the public or private orientation and the location of the initiative on a sustainable consumption and production continuum to develop a typology comprising five ideal types of sustainable consumption and production initiatives. In a later work in 2017 (Muñoz & Cohen, 2017), the same authors developed a typology comprising five ideal types of empirically -relevant business models across SE. Perren and Kozinets (2018) focused on two key axes that considered the extent of consocialit y and intermediation provided by lateral exchange initiatives, digital platforms that facilitate exchange activities among equivalently -positioned actors, to develop a typology comprising four ideal types. Although useful, studies following this stream rel ied on conceptual axes picked a priori to develop typologies and seem not to contemplate the whole SE complexity.", "This review led to the understanding that there is a gap in SE studies for classifications using broad empirical approaches. In order to fi ll this gap, the purpose of this study is to develop a broad empirical approach to classify the initiatives at work in SE. Specifically, this paper proposes to answer the following research question: What categories of initiatives are at work in SE?", "1.3. Metho d", "22 Classification involves two essential approaches: typology and taxonomy (Bailey, 1994). While a typology is conceptual and requires theoretical dimensions to define ideal types, a taxonomy begins empirically and aims to classify cases according to thei r similarity on observed attributes (Bailey, 1994).", "Considering that: (1) SE is an emerging phenomenon, conceptual classifications such as typologies may not contemplate its complexity, and (2) there is a gap for classifications using broad empirical app roaches, this study proposes a taxonomy.", "Using Allen , Beck, Scott and Rogelberg (2014) as a reference, this study employs a discourse analysis of SE initiative websites to develop the taxonomy proposed inductively. The taxonomy proposed was developed in t he following four steps: initiative selection, attribute identification, attribute aggregation, and initiative categorization, following Diniz , Siqueira and van Heck (2016).", "1.3.1. Initiative selection", "Crunchbase (2019) was initially consulted to identify the initiatives labelled as SE ventures, which resulted in a list of 555 initiatives all founded before 01/01/2019. Crunchbase (2019) is the world's leading database of private technology firms (Täuscher & Kietzmann, 2017), such as digital platforms that inte rmediate transactions between supply side and demand side in SE. SE start -ups face the same challenges that start -ups in other markets face, and several initiatives fail because of their inability to attract venture capital (Täuscher & Kietzmann, 2017). Be sides, only 50% of United States employers survive their fifth year in business (Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2019). Therefore, in order to select the most -likely -to-survive ventures, only active initiatives founded before 01/01/2014 and that raised any amo unt of equity funding were selected, resulting in a list of 42 initiatives. A list of all 42 initiatives and their corresponding websites is provided in the Appendix. Taking these 42 initiatives into consideration, this study proceeded to identify their at tributes.", "It should be said that, by only selecting initiatives that have survived at least five years and have raised an amount of equity funding, this study avoids classifying business models not yet validated that may not last in the long run. On the o ther hand, by leaving these ventures out, this study might not contemplate the entire set of relevant SE initiatives in the future. Therefore, this study should be updated from time to time.", "1.3.2. Attribute identification", "To identify relevant attributes, we a nalysed the data available from all 42 initiatives on their websites (texts, images, and videos). Whenever a relevant attribute was observed, it was textually described (e.g. demand side is reviewed by supply side), and the corresponding textual or visual evidence was saved. After eliminating duplicate entries, a list of 28 relevant attributes remained. NVivo 12 was used to label and organize the evidences saved because it is a qualitative software tool that helps store, organize, categorize, and analyse un structured data such as interview transcripts, articles, and web content (Richards, 1999).", "1.3.3. Attribute aggregation", "Aggregating observable data into abstract concepts of a higher level is an important process in theory building and can change what is known and how a phenomenon is perceived (Van De Ven, 2007). Therefore, the attributes identified were successively aggregated by affinity, first into 8 thematic classes and then into four more comprehensive thematic groups. For example, empirically observed att ributes described as “transaction involves passenger transport supply” and “transaction involves financial resources supply” were aggregated by affinity into a thematic class named “commodity transaction”. Empirically observed attributes described as “tran saction involves accommodation supply” and “transaction involves knowledge supply” were aggregated by affinity into a thematic class named “unique transaction”. “Commodity transaction” and “unique transaction” thematic classes were aggregated by affinity i nto a thematic group named “transaction uniqueness”. Table 1 contains the empirically observed attributes, the initial aggregation into attribute classes, and the final aggregation into attribute groups.", "24 Table 1 - Relevant attribute s aggregated into classes and groups Empirically observed attributes Attribute classes Attribute groups Initiative intermediates transactions between a supply side and a demand side (P2P transactions) Intermediation initiative Initiative role Trans action prices are mainly set by supply side Initiative charges supply side and/or demand side a fee per intermediation Supply side is reviewed by demand side Demand side is reviewed by supply side Initiative directly sells to private indivi duals (B2C transactions) Direct selling initiative Initiative directly sells to businesses (B2B transactions) Transaction prices are mainly set by the initiative Initiative charges customers using a pay -per-unit system Initiative charges cu stomers using a pay -per-use system Initiative charges customers using a subscription system 25 Empirically observed attributes Attribute classes Attribute groups Initiative defines the terms of intermediation Centralized -control initiative Initiative control Participants may vote to change terms of intermediation Decentralized -control initiative Transaction involves passenger transport supply Commodity transaction Transaction uniqueness Transaction involves logistics supply Transaction involves financial resources supply Transaction involves other standardized goods and services supply Transaction involves accommodation supply Unique transaction Transaction involves carpooling supply Transaction involves gastronomic experiences supply Transaction involves knowledge supply 26 Empirically observed attributes Attribute classes Attribute groups Transac tion involves medical services supply Transaction involves other unique goods and services supply Demand side pays supply side For-profit transaction Transaction purpose Customers pay the initiative Initiative asks supply side for donations Non-profit transaction Supply side gives financial resources to demand side Demand side gives non -monetary rewards to supply side in order to thank donations The next step was to use the four attribute groups to categorize the initiatives.", "1.3.4. Initiative categorization", "Based on the four attribute groups, four questions were developed and answered by the researchers from the perspective of each initiative.", "Initiative role: is the key role of the initiative to intermediate transactions betw een supply side and demand side or to sell services directly to consumers?", "Initiative control: are the intermediation service terms defined in a centralized manner by the initiative or in a decentralized manner by the participants’ votes? Transaction un iqueness: is the service provided by the supply side to the demand side through the initiative a commodity or unique?", "Transaction purpose: does the service provided by the supply side to the demand side through the initiative involve a monetary compensat ion, therefore characterizing a for -profit transaction?", "Regarding initiative roles, direct sellers were not considered as SE initiatives since the study adopts the following SE definition: “a web of markets in which individuals use various forms of compen sation to transact the redistribution of and access to resources, mediated by a digital platform operated by an organisation” (Mair & Reischauer, 2017, p. 12). Car rentals, scooter rentals, and all sorts of B2C rentals have been known for a long time, but since the physical assets involved are rented to consumers resulting in consumption without ownership, these initiatives might promote themselves as SEs without fitting the SE definition. Therefore, the question regarding initiative role was used to shed light on these pseudo - SE initiatives, but was not considered in the final step of the taxonomy development. The final step of the taxonomy development considered the last three questions proposed, which resulted in 8 (2^3) possible combinations. Table 2 summarizes all possible combinations to be discussed in the next section.", "28 Table 2 - Possible combinations according to the last three proposed questions Initiative Control Transaction Uniqueness Transaction Purpose Taxonomy Centra lized Commodity For-profit Commodity Intermediary Non-profit Wealth Redistributor Unique For-profit Unique -Service Intermediary Non-profit Skill Redistributor Decentralized Commodity For-profit Decentralized Commodity Intermediary Non-profit Not empirically observed Unique For-profit Not empirically observed Non-profit Not empirically observed", "1.4. Results and discussion", "After answering each question from the perspective of each initiative, five categories at work in SE emerged: Commodity In termediary, Wealth Redistributor, Unique -Service Intermediary, Skill Redistributor, and Decentralized Commodity Intermediary. Although possible, three SE categories were not observed among the initiatives selected.", "Commodity Intermediaries: the role of th ese initiatives is to intermediate transactions between a supply side and a demand side. They usually monetize by charging the supply side and/or the demand side a fee per intermediation. These fees and other terms of intermediation are centrally set by th e initiatives. Services provided by the supply side for the demand side are standardized and involve a monetary compensation, therefore being characterized as for -profit transactions. This category includes initiatives that intermediate passenger transport (e.g. Bolt), 29 logistics (e.g. PickThisUp), and other standardized services between a supply side and a demand side.", "Commodity intermediaries (e.g. Bolt) and corresponding incumbents (e.g. taxis) offer highly interchangeable services, apparently leading t o a price -sensitive demand. Therefore, commodity intermediaries seem to set the price of transactions between supply side and demand side more frequently than unique -service intermediaries, which usually let prices be set by the supply side.", "Commodity int ermediations also rely on personal reputation, but reputation systems seem quite simpler than those provided by unique -service intermediaries. For example, before soliciting a transport passenger service, the demand side usually has drivers chosen by the intermediary instead of evaluating supply -side profiles. Passengers and drivers usually evaluate each other, often with a score, and initiatives usually cut off users below a minimum score. Commodity intermediaries tend not to promote strong social links between supply side and demand side. Instead, matches between sides tend to be automated or simplified, and one side tends not to care that much about who is on the other side. Although supply side may see SE initiatives as great opportunities for income a t first, when it comes to standardized services, the power tends to be concentrated with the intermediary who may turn apparent opportunities into poorly paid jobs with no benefits by decreasing prices, increasing intermediation fees, and changing other in termediation terms.", "Wealth Redistributors: the role of these initiatives is to intermediate transactions between a supply side and a demand side. The terms of intermediation are centrally set by the initiatives. Services provided by supply side to demand side are standardized and do not involve monetary compensations, therefore being characterized as non -profit transactions. This category includes initiatives that intermediate financial resources such as crowdfunding ventures (e.g. Zoomaal) and some non -governmental organisations (e.g. FII) between a supply side and a demand side.", "In crowdfunding initiatives, the demand side creates projects and makes appeals to the supply side for financial donations. Intermediaries usually charge the demand side a fee per transaction. Demand side also specifies non -monetary compensations for different contribution levels, but transactions with supply side are not necessarily based on those compensations. Although such initiatives are usually included in the SE, they are not usually highlighted in classification studies.", "30 Non-governmental organisations are usually non -profit and some of them provide wealth redistribution, but instead of the demand side, it is the non -governmental initiatives themselves that usually ask t he supply side for financial donations. Although these organisations are not usually included in SE, they could evolve to act similarly to crowdfunding initiatives, resulting in more transparency between donors and projects funded.", "Unique -Service Intermed iaries: the role of these initiatives is to intermediate transactions between a supply side and a demand side. They usually monetize by charging the supply side and/or demand side a fee per intermediation. These fees and other intermediation terms are cent rally set by the initiatives. Services provided by the supply side for the demand side are unique and involve a monetary compensation, therefore being characterized as for - profit transactions. This category includes initiatives that intermediate accommodat ion (e.g. Airbnb), gastronomic experiences (e.g. Gnamo), and other unique services between a supply side and a demand side.", "Unique services are lowly -interchangeable, apparently leading to a price -inelastic demand. Therefore, although unique -service inter mediaries usually reserve the right to modify the terms of intermediation such as transaction fees, the supply side usually has more autonomy to set the service terms provided for the demand side, such as prices.", "Unique -service intermediations rely on mor e sophisticated reputation systems than those provided by commodity intermediaries. Profiles contain much more personal information such as photos and storytelling narratives. Demand and supply side usually evaluate each other not only with a score, but al so with a textual review.", "Finally, since the demand side tends to value variety in unique services, and there is no perfect substitute for each offer on the supply side, power tends to be more balanced between the supply side and the unique -service inter mediaries, apparently leading to higher levels of satisfaction and engagement and lower levels of litigation.", "Skill Redistributors: the role of these initiatives is to intermediate transactions between a supply side and a demand side. The terms of interm ediation are centrally set by the initiatives. The services provided by the supply side for the demand side are unique, do not involve a monetary compensation, therefore being characterized as non -profit transactions, and are paid with time -based currency (e.g. TimeRepublik).", "Time banks are alternatives for commercial markets that attempt to promote self - sufficiency and autonomy (Laamanen , Wahlen & Lorek, 2018). A participant usually begins 31 with a fixed amount of time -based money and pays other participa nts with that money for their services. One hour is usually equal to one currency unit no matter the service. Therefore, participants have to sell services to the community in order to earn extra time -based money, and individuals frequently alternate betwe en supply side and demand side. Time banks are usually not highlighted in classification studies.", "Decentralized Commodity Intermediaries: the role of these initiatives is to intermediate transactions between a supply side and a demand side. The intermedia tion terms may be set by participant votes. Services provided by the supply side for the demand side are standardized, involve monetary compensation, therefore being characterized as for -profit transactions and may be paid with cryptocurrency or fiat curre ncy. This category also includes initiatives that intermediate financial resources between a supply side and a demand side, but decentralized commodity intermediaries utilize blockchain -based mechanisms that allow participants to vote for changes in the in termediation terms (e.g. Atlas).", "Blockchain -based applications record data transactions in a distributed manner by a network of computers and combined with self -executing smart contracts may enable new ways of intermediating services between supply side and demand side, giving them autonomy to set the terms of intermediation, resulting in a truly decentralized initiative (Hawlitschek et al., 2018a; Pazaitis , Filippi & Kostakis, 2017). The literature on blockchain -based initiatives in the SE context is sti ll in its first steps. Although their potential implications on the subject are huge, these initiatives are usually not highlighted in classification studies.", "Not empirically observed: after answering each proposed question from the perspective of each in itiative, three potential categories did not appear in the initiatives database. By analogy, they would be called decentralized wealth redistributors, decentralized unique -service intermediaries, and decentralized skill redistributors. They are expected to be empirically observed as blockchain -based technology moves forward, giving the supply side and/or the demand side of these initiatives more autonomy to set the intermediation terms.", "1.5. Conclusion", "This study aimed to answer the research question “what ca tegories of initiatives are at work in SE?” so a taxonomy was proposed to answer this question. The taxonomy proposed started by systematically selecting a set of initiatives. An intensive search on secondary data 32 about the initiatives selected was then co nducted in order to identify relevant attributes. The attributes identified were successively aggregated resulting in four attribute groups. In the end, each initiative was analysed from the perspective of each attribute group, resulting in five SE categor ies: commodity intermediary, wealth redistributor, unique -service intermediary, skill redistributor, and decentralized commodity intermediary.", "The results suggest meaningful theoretical implications for researchers. First, this study brought a new perspe ctive on SE and its multifaceted nature. Using a taxonomic approach, it was able to distinguish commodity intermediaries and unique -service intermediaries, which have different implications, but that previous studies classified and discussed together. Find ings suggest that generalizations from previous contributions in different categories might be problematic, which may influence future study designs. The study also sheds light on decentralized commodity intermediaries, usually not highlighted in classific ation studies, reinforcing a new avenue for future research on impacts of blockchain development on SE. Motivations and consequences of wealth redistributors and skill redistributors could also be better explored in the future.", "The results also suggest m eaningful practical implications for SE entrepreneurs and policymakers. SE entrepreneurs should consider the implications of different SE categories in order to design appropriate platforms. For example, commodity intermediaries may be designed to set pric es instead of the supply side, and unique -service intermediaries may be designed to allow more detailed supply -side profiles. Policymakers should take into consideration the implications of different SE categories in order to put in place different rules f or different categories, avoiding regulating all SE initiatives together. For example, unbalanced power between supply side and commodity intermediaries may lead to specific rules to protect the supply side.", "These findings shed light on the heterogeneity of SE, joining studies such as Lim (2020), who clarifies the unique peculiarities characterising the SE, and Sands, Ferraro, Campbell, Kietzmann, and Andonopoulos (2020), who find three segments of sharing consumers. Regarding limitations, criteria used in the initiative selection process imply in a risk of selection bias. Unselected initiatives may have attributes not identified in this study. Therefore, the initiatives selected may not represent the full spectrum of SE initiatives. Another limitation is the manual process of identifying attributes, aggregating them into classes and joining classes into groups.", "33 Although useful to increase comprehension about a phenomenon, classifications are limited. Utilizing classifications to design strategies requir es parsimony since new entities to be classified may not necessarily fit previous classifications. Optimum strategies are usually designed for specific entities and not for their categories. Finally, different natures of consumers as well as different cons umption contexts may lead to different classifications. Future work could investigate if people engage with different SE categories driven by different factors or by the same factors in different ways. Besides, future researches could assess implications of different SE categories on several aspects of society such as consumption, competition, labour, and public finance. Finally, future studies could continue to explore differences in how platform owners strategize to intermediate standardized and unique s ervices in SE.", "34 References", "Allen, J.A., Beck, T., Scott, C.W., & Rogelberg, S.G.

An integrated model for building trust in sharing economy transaction s", "Abstract", "The literature on how trust is formed in the sharing economy is disperse. While most authors investigated this process from the perspective of demanders toward suppliers, others focused on the perspective of demanders toward platforms, suppli ers toward demanders, or suppliers toward platforms. This study organizes the subject. Using a systematic literature review approach, it was possible to identify 142 perspective -specific antecedents of trust and group them into seven high -level antecedents : third -party evaluation, counterpart self - presentation, first -party experience, social motivation, economic motivation, hedonic motivation, and propensity to trust. These high -level antecedents constitute an integrated and parsimonious model that explains the formation of trust in sharing economy transactions from multiple perspectives.", "Keywords: sharing economy; peer -to-peer platform; digital platform; trust model; systematic literature review", "2.1. Introduction", "Sleeping in strangers’ houses, welcoming stra ngers into our homes, and ridesharing with strangers would have been considered improbable just a few years ago. However, this is what many of us have been doing via Airbnb and Uber, two of the most prominent sharing economy (SE) platforms. In 2019 alone, guests used Airbnb to book 326.9 million nights and experiences from hosts available in more than 220 countries and regions, generating gross bookings of US$ 38.0 billion (Airbnb, 2020). In the same year, Uber operated in approximately 10,000 cities and arranged 6.9 billion trips (Uber, 2020). Meanwhile, global revenue from five key SE sectors is expected to jump from US$ 15 B in 2014 to US$ 335 B in 2025 (PwC, 2015).", "The wide adoption of SE platforms relies heavily on trust. Indeed, trust has been broadly identified as crucial to the functioning of the SE (Chang & Wang, 2018; Hawlitschek , 41 Notheisen & Teubner, 2018; Lu , Cai & King, 2020; Möhlmann, 2015; Nguyen , Alaoui & Llosa, 2020; ter Huurne , Ronteltap, Corten & Buskens, 2017; Tussyadiah & Pesonen, 2018; Wang , Asaad & Filieri, 2020). This occurs for three main reasons. First, SE transactions usually begin at a distance, which potentially increases the information asymmetry (Arrow, 1963) between individuals who supply and individuals who demand access to re sources, thus increasing risk for both parties. Second, these transactions are typically followed by face -to-face interactions (Ert, Fleischer & Magen, 2016), potentially increasing concerns associated with personal safety. Third, the SE usually cannot rel y on governmental laws and regulations (Berg , Slettemeås, Kjørstad & Rosenberg, 2020), which can make it difficult to solve conflicts arising from this type of transaction.", "Even though much of the literature has addressed trust, research on trust formatio n in the context of the SE remains disperse. In order to explain how trust is built in SE transactions, previous literature has explored antecedents of trust from four distinguishable perspectives: demanders toward suppliers (e.g., Ert et al., 2016), deman ders toward platforms (e.g., Ye , Ying, Zhou & Wang, 2019), suppliers toward demanders (e.g., Cheng , Su & Yang, 2020), and suppliers toward platforms (e.g., Wang et al., 2020). Nevertheless, there is still a need for an integrated understanding of how this trust-building process occurs from multiple perspectives. This study aims to develop a single and integrated model to explain the formation of trust from all the aforementioned perspectives. By doing so, this work contributes to the literature on trust b uilding in the SE. More specifically, its key contributions are threefold. First, it synthesizes prior findings on the subject, consolidating studies that deal with specific antecedents of trust. Second, it proposes an integrated theoretical model that dea ls with different categories of SE platforms and the four trust -building perspectives: demand side toward supply side; demand side toward platforms; from supply side toward demand side; and from supply side toward platforms. Third, by considering the propo sed model as a knowledge base, it orientates research in the future.", "The overall objective of this work – to develop an integrated model based on prior findings in a replicable and scientific manner – justified the choice of a systematic review as the res earch method (Paul & Criado, 2020; Snyder, 2019). Accordingly, this study is structured as follows: section 2.2 presents the theoretical background that supports this investigation; section 2.3 shows a description of how the systematic review was conducted in order to identify, analyze, and group perspective -specific antecedents of trust toward an integrated model ; section 2.4 presents the proposed model; and section 2.5 concludes by providing directions for research 42 in the future as well as highlighting th e main contributions, implications, and limitations of this study.", "2.2. Theoretical background", "The SE is a recent phenomenon that has been transforming consumer behavior (Möhlmann, 2015). Therefore, before analyzing trust formation in the context of the SE, it is important to understand key concepts regarding what the SE is, why people participate in the SE, and what is the role of trust in SE transactions. These key concepts are introduced below. There is no consensus on a SE definition (Li & Wang, 2020; Ri chardson, 2015).", "Although sharing is as known as humankind, the SE is a recent phenomenon born of the Internet age (Belk, 2014). Indeed, the term SE started to appear in Scopus database in the early 2000s. Since then, it has become a wide concept used loos ely to account for a set of new forms of production and consumption (Acquier , Daudigeos & Pinkse, 2017). This study focuses on what is actually new in this recent phenomenon, and following Mair and Reischauer (2017) and Fernandes , Chimenti and Nogueira (2020), it defines the SE as a group of markets in which digital platforms mediate transactions between private individuals who supply and private individuals who demand access to resources. One of the most prominent SE platforms is Airbnb, which mediates tra nsactions between hosts who supply and guests who demand access to accommodation. Figure 1 shows the three main actors involved in SE transactions and how each one is referred to throughout this study.", "Figure 1 - The three main actors involved in SE transactions", "demander or demand side or buye r or consumer (e.g., gue st) s uppl ier or supply side or seller or produc er (e.g., hos t) transaction (e.g., a ccommodation sharing) digital platform or platform (e.g., A irbnb)", "43 Previous attempts to categorize SE initiatives have used typological and taxonomic approaches. While typologies set theoretical dimensions a priori to define ideal types, taxonomies classify cases according to their obs erved attributes (Bailey, 1994). For example, Cohen and Muñoz (2016) examined SE activities while taking into account two dimensions: a continuum from sustainable production to sustainable consumption and a continuum from public orientation to private orie ntation. Based on a matrix formed by these two dimensions, they developed a typology comprised of five ideal types: four corners and an area of hybridization in the middle. More recently, Fernandes et al. (2020) systematically selected a set of SE initiati ves and analyzed their attributes to develop a taxonomy with five categories: commodity intermediaries, wealth redistributors, unique -service intermediaries, skill redistributors, and decentralized commodity intermediaries. These studies have helped to highlight the heterogeneity of the SE.", "People are motivated to engage in SE transactions because of social (Böcker & Meelen, 2017), economic (Böcker & Meelen, 2017; Hamari , Sjöklint & Ukkonen, 2016), and hedonic (Hamari et al., 2016) factors. Social factors include the expectation of getting to know and interact with other people (Böcker & Meelen, 2017). Economic factors include the expectation of new income (Böcker & Meelen, 2017) or resource saving (Böcker & Meelen, 2017; Hamari et al., 2016), and hedonic f actors include the expectation of participating in enjoyable activities (Hamari et al., 2016). Regarding the relationship between environmental concerns and the SE, there is no consensus. While the SE may promote a more sustainable consumption of resources by favoring access over ownership (e.g., ridesharing instead of buying a car), this can be considered an important appeal (Böcker & Meelen, 2017; Hamari et al., 2016) or only a positive side effect (Hartl , Sabitzer, Hofmann & Penz, 2018) by SE users.", "No matter what the case is, before actually carrying out a SE transaction, suppliers and demanders must trust each other and the platform (ter Huurne et al., 2017). Trust is the subjective perception of a trustor that their counterpart will perform as expecte d (Ert et al., 2016; Tussyadiah & Park, 2018). Therefore, in a SE transaction, the trustor is an individual (supplier or demander), and the counterpart may be an individual (demander or supplier) or an institution (platform).", "Trust can be broken into thre e facets: ability or competence, benevolence or kindness, and integrity or honesty (Mayer , Davis & Schoorman, 1995). Ability regards the trustor’s perception that their counterpart has the required skills, competences, or characteristics to perform as anti cipated. Benevolence regards the trustor’s perception that their counterpart 44 wants to do good to the trustor, and integrity regards the trustor’s perception that their counterpart adheres to a set of moral values that the trustor considers acceptable. Vari ous studies have considered the same dimensions to operationalize the trustworthiness of individuals and institutions (e.g., Teubner , Adam & Hawlitschek, 2019; Tussyadiah & Park, A given trustor cannot directly measure their coun terpart’s trustworthiness. Therefore, a trustor infers the counterpart’s trustworthiness from available cues (Ert et al., 2016; Ert & Fleischer, 2020; Lu et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020; Yang , Lee, Lee & Koo , 2018; Zhang , Yan, Zhang & Leihan, 2018). For ex ample, an Airbnb guest may infer their host’s trustworthiness from photos and self -descriptions in their online profiles. In this case, the guest is the trustor, the host is the counterpart, and the photos and self -descriptions are the cues. In order to b etter understand how trust is built in SE transactions, previous articles have explored the antecedents of trust and considered different approaches and perspectives. For example, Ert et al. (2016) contended that demanders infer suppliers’ trustworthiness from their photos, while Ye et al. (2019) provided evidence that the higher a platform’s social presence, the higher the demander’s overall trust toward the platform. Cheng et al. (2020) mapped key factors influencing trust from suppliers toward demanders in the context of ridesharing, and Wang et al. (2020) developed a model of antecedents and consequences of trust from suppliers toward platforms. Meanwhile, Ter Huurne et al. (2017) brought together antecedents of trust but did not reach an integrated mode l applicable to all four perspectives. Therefore, there is a need for an integrated understanding of how this trust -building process occurs from multiple perspectives.", "2.3. Method", "Previous research has explored trust formation in the context of the SE from f our distinguishable perspectives. By building on and synthesizing previous findings, this study aims to develop an integrated model applicable to all these perspectives. In order to contemplate the whole complexity of the existing literature in a replicabl e and scientific manner, this study adopts a systematic literature review method.", "A systematic literature review is a thorough review that applies replicable and scientific processes to identify, choose, and critically evaluate relevant knowledge on a cle arly formulated 45 question (Christofi , Leonidou & Vrontis, 2017; de Menezes & Kelliher, 2011). By applying replicable and scientific procedures, systematic reviews aim to eliminate bias in literature reviews (Christofi et al., 2017; de Menezes & Kelliher, 20 11; Tranfield , Denyer & Smart, 2003). There are several types of systematic review. Those that focus on a specific domain are named domain -based reviews (Paul & Criado, 2020), and among domain -based reviews, there are those that aim to develop theoretical models and/or testable hypotheses or propositions. Such reviews are named theory -building reviews (Paul & Criado, 2020). Given its focus on trust formation in the context of the SE and its objective of developing an integrated model, this study can be clas sified as a theory -building systematic review.", "Snyder (2019) and Paul and Criado (2020) provided useful guidelines on how to conduct systematic reviews and avoid common pitfalls of this type of research. Following their work, this systematic review involv ed six steps.", "First, Scopus (www.elsevier.com/solutions/scopus) was selected as the database because it is the largest abstract and citation database of scientific literature in the world (Schotten , Aisati, Meester, Steiginga & Ross, 2017).", "Second, in or der to identify literature related to the more general question “how trust is built in SE transactions?” or the more specific one “what are the antecedents of trust in the context of the SE?”, a search for “sharing economy” AND *trust* within titles, abstr acts, and keywords was performed in mid 2020, resulting in 294 documents.", "Third, using Scopus filter tools, results were limited to articles, in terms of document type, and journals, in terms of source type. These filters were applied in order to exclude materials that had not undergone a peer -review process. No filters regarding subject area, year of publishing, or language were applied, resulting in 168 articles.", "Fourth, titles and abstracts of these 168 articles were read and those that did not focus on explaining “how trust is built in SE transactions?” or did not investigate “what are the antecedents of trust in the context of the SE?” were discarded, since these are the questions pursued by this study. In the end, 33 articles remained. Figure 2 summa rizes the systematic selection process of this study.", "Figure 2 - Systematic selection of the previous literature relevant to this study", "Fifth, the 493 pages of the 33 selected articles were read and re -read; initial ideas were also noted. Then, considering the overall aim of this study, the content of each article was coded according to the following labels: the trust -building perspective, SE case, sample size (n), sample unit, data collection method, and antecedent of trust. I n this step, it was possible to identify 142 perspective -specific antecedents of trust. For details of the coding process, see the Appendix.", "Sixth, a thematic analysis was performed to group the perspective -specific antecedents of trust into higher -level constructs applicable to all four trust -building perspectives. Thematic analysis is a method for recognizing, examining, and communicating patterns within data, which is frequently used to interpret multiple aspects of a research topic (Braun & Clarke, 2006). A theme captures some important pattern about the data in relation to the study objective (Braun & Clarke, 2006). Theme -related constructs were grouped into higher -level ones following Osigweh's (1989) and Van de Ven's (2007) procedures for climbing an abstraction ladder through successive and iterative rounds of analysis. This procedure allows the formation of mature and more general constructs, which are accurate enough to be tested in wider ranges of situations (Osigweh, 1989; Rodrigues , Chimenti & N ogueira, 2021; Van de Ven, 2007). The resulting higher -level constructs were evaluated against the four trust -building perspectives at the same time.

High -level antecedentes of trust", "As mentioned in the conceptual background, a given trustor cannot directly measure their counterpart’s trustworthiness. Therefore, the trustor infers their counterpart’s trustworthiness from available cues. Throughout the thematic analysis, three kinds of cues were identified: cues from third parties who had previous experience with the counte rpart, cues made available by the counterpart about themselves, and cues that the trustor can uncover by interacting directly with the counterpart. Therefore, three higher -level antecedents of trust emerged: (1) third -party evaluation, (2) counterpart self -presentation, and (3) first -party experience.", "Continuing the thematic analysis, while always having the conceptual background in mind, another three higher -level antecedents of trust emerged that relate to the reasons people engage in SE transactions: ( 4) social motivation, (5) economic motivation, and (6) hedonic 50 motivation.

Therefore, in line with the purpose of developing an integrated model applicable to all four perspectives, these 17 antecedents were grouped with the only dependent variable of the proposed model: trust.

Initially, p rior literature was systematically selected and synthesized to develop a comprehensive model applicable to multiple trust - building perspectives and categories of sharing economy platforms. Then, a survey was conducted to validate the constructs and test th e model with Airbnb guests. A sample of 351 responses was collected and analyzed using Structural Equation Modeling. As a result, the study provides evidence that Third -Party Evaluation, First -Party Interaction, and Social Motivation do have a significant role in driving Trust. In addition, it was found that the strength of these effects is moderated by the respondent's Propensity to Trust.", "Keywords: sharing economy, peer -to-peer platform, Airbnb, trust model, structural equation modeling", "3.1. Introductio n", "Over the past decade, we have changed the way we deal with people we do not know. Using sharing economy (SE) platforms, like Airbnb and Uber, many of us have been sleeping in strangers’ houses, welcoming strangers into our homes and ridesharing with strange rs. Something that would have been considered improbable just a few years ago. In 2020 alone, Uber operated in approximately 10,000 cities and arranged five billion trips (Uber, 2021). Airbnb was created in 2007 and has since grown to four million hosts wh o have welcomed over 800 million guest arrivals to approximately 100,000 cities in almost every region of the world The SE encompasses different categories of platforms (Fernandes , Chimenti & Nogueira, 2020), but facilitating trust among s trangers is a key challenge for all of them. Indeed, trust has been repeatedly identified as one of the most important drivers of the success of the 84 SE (Ert , Flei scher & Magen, 2016; Lu , Cai & King, 2020; Möhlmann, 2015; Nguyen , Alaoui & Llosa, 2020; ter H uurne , Ronteltap, Corten & Buskens, 2017; Tussyadiah & Pesonen, 2018; Wang , Asaad & Filieri, 2020). Therefore, the question of how trust is built is of great interest and prior literature explored antecedents of trust in SE transactions from four distingui shable perspectives: demanders toward suppliers (e.g., Ert et al., 2016), demanders toward platforms (e.g., Ye , Ying, Zhou & Wang, 2019), suppliers toward demanders (e.g., Cheng , Su & Yang, 2020), and suppliers toward platforms (e.g., Cheng et al., 2020). However, there is a need for an integrated model that organizes the literature and helps academics and practitioners to understand and compare the trust building process from multiple perspectives and categories of SE platforms.", "This study addresses the f ollowing research question: which factors antecedes trust in SE transactions? By doing so, this research contributes to the SE trust formation literature in three ways. First, by synthesizing prior studies that deal with specific antecedents of trust. Seco nd, by proposing an integrated theoretical model that deals with different categories of SE platforms and trust -building perspectives. Third, by testing the proposed model in a specific case.", "To this end, this paper is organized as follows. After this int roduction, Section 3.2 presents the theoretical background about trust in the SE. Section 3.3 shows the development of the proposed model from a systematic literature review. Then, Section 3.4 describes the method utilized to test the proposed model. The r esults are introduced in Section 3.5 and discussed in Section 3.6. Finally, Section 3.7 covers the study’s conclusions, limitations and future research directions.", "3.2. Theoretical background", "Agreement on the definition of SE is far from being reached (ter H uurne et al., 2017). This study follows Mair and Reischauer (2017) and Fernandes et al. (2020), focusing on what is actually new in this recent phenomenon, to define the SE as a group of markets in which digital platforms mediate transactions between indiv iduals who demand and individuals who supply access to resources. In other words, the SE comprises individuals (demanders) who use online platforms to reach and transact directly with other individuals (suppliers). As an example, one of the most prominent SE platforms is Airbnb, which mediates transactions 85 between guests who demand and hosts who supply access to accommodation. The main actors involved in SE transactions are shown in Figure 6.", "Figure 6 - Actors involved in SE tran sactions", "The rise of the SE is believed to be driven by social (Böcker & Meelen, 2017), economic (Böcker & Meelen, 2017; Hamari , Sjöklint & Ukkonen, 2016) and hedonic (Hamari et al., 2016) motivations. Social reasons comprise the expectation of getting t o know and interact with other people (Böcker & Meelen, 2017). Economic motives involve the expectation of new income (Böcker & Meelen, 2017) or resource saving (Böcker & Meelen, 2017; Hamari et al., 2016), and hedonic factors comprehend the expectation of participating in enjoyable activities (Hamari et al., 2016).", "Over time, different SE models were observed and researchers began to propose classifications of SE platforms. Classification involves two key approaches: typology and taxonomy (Bailey, 1994). While a typology is conceptual and chooses theoretical dimensions a priori to delimit ideal types, a taxonomy begins empirically and pursues to classify cases according to their similarity on observed attributes (Bailey, 1994). However, since the SE is an emerging phenomenon, conceptual classifications such as typologies may not cover its full complexity. Therefore, Fernandes et al. (2020) used a broad empirical approach to propose a taxonomy. They systematically selected a set of SE initiatives and analyze d their attributes to develop a taxonomy with five categories: commodity intermediary, wealth redistributor, unique -service intermediary, skill redistributor, and decentralized commodity intermediary. Table 7 shows details about the five categories of SE p latforms proposed by Fernandes et al.", "transaction (e.g., accommodation sharing) demander (e.g., guest) s uppl ier (e.g., host) digital platform (e.g., Airbnb)", "86 Table 7 - Categories of SE platforms Commodity Intermediaries Wealth Redistributors Unique -Service Intermediaries Skill Redistributors Decentralized Commodity Intermediaries transacti on uniqueness standardized transactions / less distinguishable suppliers standardized transactions / less distinguishable suppliers unique transactions / more distinguishable suppliers unique transactions / more distinguishable suppliers standardized trans actions / less distinguishable suppliers transaction purpose for-profit transactions / suppliers earn monetary compensation non-profit transactions / suppliers earn non-monetary compensation for-profit transactions / suppliers earn monetary compensation non-profit transactions / suppliers earn non-monetary compensation for-profit transactions / suppliers earn monetary compensation initiative control intermediation service terms are defined in a centralized manner by the platform intermediation service terms are defined in a centralized manner by the platform intermediation service terms are defined in a centralized manner by the platform intermediation service terms are defined in a centralized manner by the platform intermediation service terms are define d in a decentralized manner by the participants’ votes example Uber GoFundMe Airbnb TimeRepublik Drife", "No matter what the case is, demanders and suppliers must trust each other and the platform before actually carrying out a SE transaction (ter Huurne et al., 2017). In other words, trust must be built from four distinguishable perspectives to enable a SE transaction: demander toward supplier, demander toward platform, supplier toward demander, and supplier toward platform.", "Trust is the subjective perce ption of a trustor that their counterpart will perform as anticipated (Ert et al., 2016; Tussyadiah & Park, 2018) and can be broken into three dimensions: ability, benevolence, and integrity (Mayer , Davis & Schoorman, 1995). Ability 87 comprises the trustor’s perception that their counterpart has the required competences or characteristics to perform as expected. Benevolence cover the trustor’s perception that their counterpart wants to do good to the first. Integrity comprehend the trustor’s perception that their counterpart adheres to a set of principles that the first finds acceptable. During the trust -building process, a given trustor may infer their counterpart’s trustworthiness from available cues (Ert et al., 2016; Ert & Fleischer, 2020; Lu et al., 2020 ; Wang et al., 2020; Yang , Lee, Lee & Koo, 2018; Zhang , Yan & Zhang, 2018). For example, an Uber passenger may infer their driver’s trustworthiness from photos and average rating showed in their online profiles. In this case, the trustor is the passenger, the counterpart is the driver, and the cues are the photos and average rating.", "In order to better understand how trust is built in SE transactions, prior studies have explored specific antecedents of trust, from distinguishable trust -building perspectives , within different categories of SE platforms. For example, considering a unique -service intermediary, Ert et al. (2016) argued that demanders infer suppliers’ trustworthiness from their personal photos. Ye et al. (2019) analyzed unique -service intermediar ies and provided evidence that the higher a platform’s social presence, the higher the demander’s overall trust toward the platform. Considering commodity intermediaries, Cheng et al. (2020) mapped key factors influencing trust from suppliers toward demand ers. Wang et al. (2020) examined a unique -service intermediary and developed a model of antecedents and consequences of trust from suppliers toward platforms.", "This study proposes an integrated model to explains how this process occurs in multiple trust-building perspectives and categories of SE platforms, and begins to test it on a specific perspective of a specific platform.", "3.3. The research model", "In order to develop a comprehensive understanding of how trust is built in SE transactions, a systematic liter ature review was performed, following Snyder (2019) and Paul and Criado (2020) guidelines. Scopus was selected because it is the world’s largest abstract and citation database of scientific literature (Schotten , Aisati, Meester, Steiginga & Ross, 2017). A search for “sharing economy” AND *trust* within titles, abstracts, and keywords was performed, and outcomes were limited to articles published in academic and peer -reviewed 88 journals, resulting in 168 articles. Those were read and the ones not focused on ex plaining “how trust is built in SE transactions?” or did not investigate “which factors antecedes trust in SE transactions?” were discarded. In the end, 33 articles remained. A thematic analysis was performed to group the 142 antecedents of trust identifie d in the selected articles into high -level constructs applicable to multiple trust -building perspectives and categories of SE platforms (Braun & Clarke, 2006). Theme -related constructs were grouped into high -level ones following Osigweh's (1989) and Van de Ven's (2007) procedures for climbing an abstraction ladder through successive and iterative rounds of analysis. This procedure allows the formation of mature and more general constructs, which are accurate enough to be tested in wider ranges of situations (Osigweh, 1989; Rodrigues , Chimenti & Nogueira, 2021; Van de Ven, 2007). To increase validity, this thematic analysis was discussed with a group of six specialists in Business , on three different occasions. Between each occasion, the model matured, and a new version was sent and discussed with the group, until a final version was reached. Considering that a trustor cannot directly measure their counterpart’s trustworthiness, but can infer it from available cues, four kinds of cues were identified througho ut the thematic analysis. In other words, four high -level antecedents of trust emerged that relate to the cues a trustor can assess to infer their counterpart’s trustworthiness:", "(1) third -party evaluation, comprising cues from third parties who transacte d with the counterpart (2) counterpart self -presentation, with the cues made available by the counterpart about themselves (3) first -party experience, with cues that the trustor knows from previous experience and (4) first -party interaction, uniting cues that the trustor can uncover by currently interacting with the counterpart.", "Continuing the thematic analysis, while always having the conceptual background in mind, another three high -level antecedents of trust emerged that relate to the reasons peop le have for engaging in SE transactions: (5) social motivation, (6) economic motivation, and (7) hedonic motivation. Lastly, it was suggested that (8) propensity to trust is a moderating variable in the proposed model. Next, every construct and hypothesis of the research model is detailed.", "Third -party evaluation (TPE) 89 TPE is here defined as the set of cues made available by third parties in a SE transaction. Third parties can leave more subjective cues, such as social referrals (e.g., Kong , Wang , Hajli & Featherman, 2020), or more objective ones, such as rating scores (e.g., Zhang et al., 2018), helping a trustor to make inferences about their counterpart’s trustworthiness. When the counterpart is an individual, TPE is usually observable in its profile wi thin the platform through one or more of the following cues: textual reviews, star -rating evaluations, identity verifications (e.g., email or Facebook account), and quality certifications (e.g., Superhost badge granted by Airbnb). Similarly, when the count erpart is a platform, TPE is usually observable in its listing within app stores (e.g., Apple's App Store) through one or more of the following cues: textual reviews, and star -rating evaluations. Based on the literature review presented above, the followin g hypothesis is proposed:", "H1: TPE positively influences Trust.", "Counterpart self -presentation (CSP) CSP comprises self -presentation cues made available by the counterpart in a SE transaction. The counterpart can present themselves through non -visual cues , such as self - descriptions in online profiles (e.g., Zhang et al., 2018), or visual ones, such as personal photos (e.g., Ert et al., 2016). These cues help a trustor to infer their counterpart’s trustworthiness. When the counterpart is an individual, CSP is usually observable in its profile within the platform through one or more of the following cues: personal or product photos, personal or product descriptions, and product attributes. Similarly, when the counterpart is a platform, CSP is usually observa ble through one or more of the following cues: layout, available features, available services, terms of service, and published policies (e.g., privacy policy). Therefore: H2: CSP positively influences Trust.", "First-party experience (FPE) and first -party i nteraction (FPI) FPE concerns the extra cues a trustor knows from previous experience, and FPI comprises the extra cues a trustor uncovers by currently interacting with their counterpart. First - party cues also help the trustor to infer their counterpart’s trustworthiness (e.g., Wang et al., 90 Sometimes this trustor has already transacted with their counterpart, whether an individual or a platform, having extra cues from previous experience. Moreover, when the counterpart is an ind ividual, a trustor usually asks them for extra information through chat systems, text messages, emails, and phone calls. Similarly, when the counterpart is a platform, a trustor usually asks it for extra information through support channels, like chat syst ems, email addresses, and phone numbers. This led to hypotheses 3 and 4: H3: FPE positively influences Trust.", "H4: FPI positively influences Trust.", "Social, Economic, and Hedonic Motivations Social motivation (SOM) is here defined as a trustor’s willingn ess to develop meaningful connections with other people by engaging in a SE transaction. In other words, given the possibility of belonging to (e.g., ter Huurne , Ronteltap & Buskens, 2020) or developing a community (e.g., Wang et al., 2020) , a trustor deci des to trust their counterpart in a SE transaction.", "Economic motivation (ECM) is here defined as a trustor’s willingness to obtain economic benefits by engaging in a SE transaction. In other words, given the possibility of avoiding costs or earning new i ncome, a trustor decides to trust their counterpart in a SE transaction.", "Hedonic motivation (HEM) is here defined as a trustor’s willingness to engage in inherently interesting, enjoyable, or fun activities by engaging in a SE transaction. In other words, given the possibility of experiencing inherently interesting, enjoyable or fun activities, a trustor decides to trust their counterpart in a SE transaction. Based on the literature, the following hypotheses are proposed: H5: SOM positively influences Tr ust.", "H6: ECM positively influences Trust.", "H7: HEM positively influences Trust.", "Propensity to trust (PTT) 91 PTT is here defined as a trustor’s overall willingness to trust their counterpart. PTT is intrinsic to a trustor, who naturally trusts (or not) oth er people and institutions. Therefore: H8: PTT moderates the relationship between Antecedents of Trust and Trust.", "By bringing together the aforementioned constructs, the proposed model integrates prior research. In addition to being applicable to multip le trust -building perspectives and categories of SE platforms, the proposed model contemplates two distinct types of high -level antecedents of trust. The first type is related to the cues a trustor can assess to infer their counterpart’s trustworthiness: t hird-party evaluation, counterpart self -presentation, first -party experience, and first -party interaction. The second type is related to the reasons people have for engaging in SE transactions: social motivation, economic motivation, and hedonic motivation . Since propensity to trust is intrinsic to a trustor, and it does not depend on SE transactions, it was considered a moderating variable in the model.

Test method", "In order to evaluate the model, an online survey was conducted using a standardized questionnaire (Babbie, 2001) to collect data from Brazilian Airbnb guests. Airbnb was selected for being one of the most prominent SE platforms, and Brazil for being one of Airbnb’s top markets in the world in terms of supply and demand for accommodation services (AllTheRooms, 2021), making it a suitable research field for this study. In the beginning of the questionnaire, respondents were asked if they had already rented acc ommodation using Airbnb. Those who answered “no” to this question received a “thank you” message and did not respond to the rest of the questionnaire. The construct measurement items were derived from prior literature to fit the study context (see the Appe ndix) and used a 5 -point Likert scale ranging from 1 \"completely disagree\" to 5 \"completely agree\". Demographic questions were included at the end of the questionnaire. Content validity was achieved by means of pre -tests with a group of specialists in Busi ness, making it possible to identify potential problems and improve measurements. A pilot test was also carried out. Around 30 participants were recruited to answer the questionnaire and assess its quality. Their answers and comments were considered, and t he instrument was revised accordingly. During scale validation, a few items with factor loadings lower than 0.7 were removed, improving the validity of the constructs (Shao & Yin, 2019). The final instrument is showed in the Appendix.", "The main survey was performed using the SurveyMonkey website, from April to June 2021.

Discussion", "The proposed model integrat es 142 factors from prior literature into nine high -level constructs that explain the formation of trust in sharing economy transactions. It is a single and parsimonious model applicable to multiple trust -building perspectives and sharing economy platforms. This is also the first model to clearly distinguish two p rocesses that complement each other in driving trust: the assessment of cues that allow a person to infer their counterpart’s trustworthiness and the motives a person has for engaging in a sharing economy transaction. In its first test, its constructs pro ved to be reliable and valid, and the model itself showed a good fit with the data, as illustrated in Table s 9 and 10. In the end, the independent variables of the model explained 80.8% of Trust variance.", "Third -Party Evaluation, a cue -assessment factor, i ntegrated the antecedents related to cues made available by third parties in a sharing economy transaction. It was constituted by more subjective constructs, such as reputation (ter Huurne , Ronteltap, Guo, Corten & Buskens, 2018) or social referrals (Kong et al., 2020), and more objective ones, such as textual reviews (Zhang et al., 2018) or star ratings (Cheng et al., 2020). These cues play an important role in helping people to overcome their natural tendency to trust only users similar to themselves (Abr ahao , Parigi, Gupta & Cook, 2017). Indeed, Third -Party Evaluation had a positive and significant impact on Trust (coefficient = 0.305; p -value = 0.014). On the other hand, Liu, Yuan and Hafeez (2019) suggested that these cues are the main factors in drivin g trust, which was not the case in this study. This might happen because people might hesitate to complain and make their negative evaluations available (Berg , Slettemeås, Kjørstad & Rosenberg, 2020). Therefore, positive evaluations may become overestimate d, diminishing the importance of such cues.", "Counterpart Self -Presentation, another cue -assessment factor, combined the antecedents related to self -presentation cues made available by the counterpart in a sharing economy 100 transaction. It was formed by visua l factors, like personal photos (Ert et al., 2016), and non - visual ones, like self -descriptions in online profiles (Zhang et al., 2018), but did not have a significant impact on Trust. One possible explanation is that people may have learned that the count erpart in a sharing economy transaction is inclined to withhold information in order to present themselves in a positive way. Therefore, today a person may prefer to consider cues left by third parties or uncovered by direct interaction , instead of self -presentation cues provided by their counterpart.", "First-Party Experience, another cue -assessment factor, combined the antecedents of trust related to extra cues a trustor knows from previous experience, but did not have a significant impact on Trust. Indeed, there are mixed findings in prior studies. While Wang et al. (2020) found that previous experience drives trust, Liu et al. (2019) pointed out the need for further investigation. One possible explanation is that a trustor usually deals with completely different counterparts in each sharing economy transaction, and past experience may not determine trust in the present.", "First-Party Interaction, another cue -assessment factor, integrated the antecedents related to extra cues a trustor uncovers by currently in teracting with their counterpart. It was constituted by more broad variables, such as general interaction (Wentrup , Nakamura & Ström, 2019), and more specific ones, such as initial interaction style (Lu et al., 2020). No matter what the case is, interactio n potentially reduces the information asymmetry between a trustor and their counterpart (Zamani , Choudrie, Katechos & Yin, 2019), and enhances trust (Lu et al., 2020). In addition, given the aforementioned do -not-like-to-complain bias that may reduce the i mpact of Third -Party Evaluation, and the lack of authenticity that may reduce the impact of Counterpart Self -Presentation, First -Party Interaction showed the highest positive and significant impact on Trust (coefficient = 0.491; p -value = 0.008). Therefore , future studies can investigate the impact of Third -Party Evaluation, Counterpart Self -Presentation and First -Party Interaction on Trust from a longitudinal perspective to see whether this is a trend. Social Motivation, a motivation factor, integrated th e antecedents related to the trustor’s willingness to develop meaningful connections with other people by engaging in a sharing economy transaction. It was formed by constructs associated with the need to belong to (e.g., ter Huurne et al., 2020) or develo p (e.g., Wang et al., 2020) a community. It is worth noticing that this study considered a unique -service intermediary, Airbnb, that strongly communicates the social benefits of transacting accommodation services through its platform. Indeed, Social Motiva tion had a positive and significant impact on Trust (coefficient = 0.197; p -value = 0.005). 101 However, future studies can consider other types of platforms, specially commodity intermediaries like Uber that may not have social benefits among their most impor tant value propositions.", "Economic Motivation, another motivation factor, combined the antecedents related to the trustor’s willingness to obtain economic benefits by engaging in a sharing economy transaction (e.g., Cheng et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020), but did not have a significant impact on Trust. One possible explanation is that prior literature investigated Economic Motivation from the perspective of suppliers, who may have stronger economic reasons to participate in sharing economy transactions than demanders, who were the focus of this test. Indeed, future studies can test the proposed model from the perspective of suppliers.", "Hedonic Motivation, another motivation factor, integrated the antecedents related to the trustor’s willingness to participat e in inherently interesting, enjoyable, or fun activities by engaging in a sharing economy transaction, but did not have a significant impact on Trust. In fact, prior literature provided mixed findings on this topic. While Cheng et al. (2020) suggested a positive impact in a qualitative study, Ye et al., (2019) found no significant impact of Hedonic Motivation on Trust. As it is possible to noticing, the impact of motivation factors on Trust may vary, and future studies can complement this one and consider other perspectives and types of platforms.", "In the end, as shown in Table 14, Propensity to Trust moderates the influence of Third - Party Evaluation, and First -Party Interaction, on Trust. More specifically, the more an individual is propense to trust, the largest is the influence of Third -Party Evaluation , and the lowest is the influence of First-Party Interaction. This might happen because believers might be satisfied with cues let by thirds , while unbelievers might need to uncover such cues first - hand , in order to infer their counterpart’s trustworthiness.", "3.7. Conclusion", "The main contribution of this study is the proposition and test of an integrated model to explain how trust is built in sharing economy transactions. By systematically selecting and synthes izing prior findings, this research developed a parsimonious model to deal with different trust-building perspectives and categories of sharing economy platforms. The results indicate that the cues an individual assess to infer their counterpart’s trustwor thiness and the reasons the 102 individual has for engaging in the sharing economy transaction can explain a large variance of its trust in the counterpart, showing a good explanatory power of the research model. In addition, the individual’s propensity to tru st moderates this relationship.", "Despite the increasing relevance of the sharing economy and the key role of trust in driving this phenomenon, the literature on how trust is built in sharing economy transactions remained scattered. By developing a more com prehensive model to explain the antecedents of trust across multiple trust -building perspectives and categories of sharing economy platforms, this study organized the prior literature. By testing the effect of cue -assessment factors, and reasons -for-engagi ng factors, this study provided evidence that Third -Party Evaluation, First - Party Interaction, and Social Motivation, do have a significant role in driving Trust. In addition, the strength of these effects is moderated by the individual’s Propensity to Tru st. More specifically, the lower the Propensity to Trust, the lower the influence of Third -Party Evaluation, and the higher the impact of First -Party Interaction, on Trust.", "Scholars can take the proposed model as a knowledge base to investigate trust buil ding from other perspectives and within other types of platforms, as well as to assess its behavior over time and across cultures. This study tested the model from the perspective of demanders toward suppliers, thus, future research can explore the perspec tives of demanders toward platforms, suppliers toward demanders and suppliers toward platforms. For example, there may be a more significant and stronger impact of Economic Motivation on Trust from suppliers toward demanders. Similarly, this study investig ated Airbnb, a unique -service intermediary, thus, research in the future can explore commodity intermediaries, wealth redistributors, skill redistributors, and decentralized commodity intermediaries. For example, commodity intermediaries like Uber may not have social benefits among their most important value propositions, thus, Social Motivation may play a less important role in driving Trust within these platforms. In addition, academics can evaluate the behavior of this model over time. For example, the a forementioned don’t -want -to complain bias may have been reducing the impact of Third -Party Evaluation on Trust over the years. Finally, researchers can assess the behavior of this model across different countries, regions and cultures. In the end, taking t he proposed model as a knowledge base, future research would complement this one and contribute to the development of a robust theory on how trust is formed in the context of the sharing economy. This research can also help practitioners to understand the complexity of building trust, and design platform features to do so. By understanding the role of both cue -assessment and motivation factors, platform managers can take more holistic approaches to facilitating trust, 103 rather than just paying attention to o nline -review and star -rating mechanisms, for example. More specifically, platform designers should strive to continuously improve functionalities that enable synchronous or asynchronous interaction between demandants and suppliers, such as chat or email sy stems. They should also consider the importance of Third -Party Evaluation on the one hand, and the don’t -want -to-complain bias on the other, to design more reliable reputation and recommendation systems. In addition, marketing managers should better commun icate the social benefits, rather than focus only on economic opportunities, derived from sharing economy transactions.", "To conclude, this study is not free from limitations. First, a theoretical model is always a simplification of reality, and may not enc ompass all factors that drive trust in sharing economy transactions, which can be added in future research. Second, the criterion used in the process of identifying antecedents of trust in the prior literature and aggregating them into high -level construct s is subjective. Third, although the model development has considered all sorts of sharing economy platform and trust building perspective, it was tested on one platform (Airbnb) and one perspective (demanders toward suppliers). So, future studies can use the constructs developed here to test the model in different trust -building perspectives, across multiple types of platforms.", "104 References", "Aaker, D.

Vários processos para remoção desses contaminantes são reportados, incluindo os Processos de Separação por Membrana (PSM) e de Oxidação Avançada (POA). Embora o emprego de membranas seja eficiente na separação de contaminantes orgânicos, os PSM apresentam problemas intrínsecos de operação, como geração de corrente de concentrado com elevado teor de poluentes.

Considerando os prós e os contras desses processos, o objetivo principal desta tese foi desenvolver um novo material que pudesse ao mesmo tempo oxidar o BPA e o DXN e separá-los durante o processo de permeação.

This study thus focus ed on two major compounds, Bisphenol -A (BPA) and 1,4 -Dioxane (DXN), that are reported to be found in waters surrou nding industry complex es. Several processes have been tested in order to improve their removal from water, including Membrane Separation (MSP) and Advanced Oxidation Processes (AOP) . Although membranes are efficient on separating emergent organic contaminants , MSP have intrinsic operati on problems , such as retentate stream with high cont ent of pollutants. On the other hand , AOP processes intents to generate highly reactive radicals to destro y the organic compound s, but, as a side effect, generation of by-products, which might be more toxic than the parent compound, are expected. Keeping the pros and cons of these processes in mind, the main goal of this thesis was to develop a new material th at could at the same time oxidize BPA and DXN and separate them during membrane permeation . Fento n reactions that involve nan o zero -valent iron (nZVI) have shown high promise in the removal of organic pollutants. Thus, i n this thesis , nZV I stabilized with carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) was first evaluated for BPA removal in solution with H 2O2 addition, which achieved more than 96% in all cond itions tested . This result was compared with the activity of nZVI loaded in hydrophilic PAA/ PVDF ( Polyacrylic acid /Polyvinylidene fluoride) membranes . As expected, the attachment of nZV I onto the membranes diminished the activity of the nanoparticles . In order to improved nZVI membrane fabrication, a novel microwave -based (MW) method was developed to assess the polymerization/cross linking of acrylic acid (AA) and generate PAA in situ of PVDF membranes . The nZVI -loaded membrane s by MW showed the highest percentage of BPA removal (52% ±0.5) under lower permeate flux (50 L/m2.h) and 10 mM of H 2O2 addition to the feed stream . •OH radical generation was confirmed by p ermeating terephthalic acid (TPA) with 10 mM of H 2O2. Further improvements were performe d with TiO 2 nanoparticles loadin g in nZVI membranes to input photocatalytic activity to the composite materi al. The photocatalytic activity of the bimetallic membrane under UV 254nm irradiation, pH 7 and 10 mM of H 2O2 could achieve the limit of detection of DXN in 2 h of reaction. TiO2/nZVI membranes presented an outstanding capability on keeping both permeability and photocatalytic activity even after 5 times of reus e. Finally, i t is important to highlight t hat in this study , promising results was obtained on applying faster MW radiation for PAA polymerization/crosslinking and nZVI loading onto PVDF membranes , in addition to the high efficiency and stability of the polymeric membranes co-doped with bimetallic nanomaterials prepared by the same technique .", "KEYWORDS: Membrane; Oxidation; Nanoparticle; Bisphenol -A; 1,4 -Dioxane", "RESUMO SILVA, Larissa Loureiro Salgueiro.

Introduction This chapter highlights the motives that led to the conduction of this thesis. It also points out the main and the specifics objectives as a complete work. The next chapters were split according to different stages of this doctorate, which started (Chapter 2) by reviewing the fundamentals of the main processes of this thesis (Membranes Separation and Advanced Oxidation Processes) , their application f or micropollutants removal from water , and the two combined processe s with the impregnation of catalytic nanoparticles in polymeric membranes. In Chapter 3, 4 and 5 is presented the experimental work, in which was first evaluated the activity of the nanoparticles in solution and attached to membranes, followed by the devel opment of a new methodology of loading nanoparticles in polymeric membranes , and, finally, the improvement of this catalytic membranes with the concept of bimetallic nanoparticles. In the end , Chapter 6 summarize s the final considerat ions of this thesis as well as the recommendations for future work.", "1.1 MOTIVATION", "Emergent pollutant s in water have been reported as one of the major problems of world health nowadays. The presence of some new toxic compounds, in specif ic the ones produced by industrial manufactures, can cause several deleterious effects if in contact with human s and animals. Also, their presence has been increasing since their accumulation on water str eams is growing fast due to more consumption of industrial products as well as the inability of the convention water and w astewater treatment plants to remove them efficiently . Besides , their concentration is still low enough that poses as a challenge to t he techniques of detection and the available processes.", "As the awareness of their intrinsic danger has been widespread, quite a few tertiary processes have been tested , aiming to increase the efficiency of the emergent contaminant removal. Technologies that apply Advanced Oxidation Process (AOP) arise as one of the most promising process es on this behalf. The reactions that take place on these systems usually aim to achieve complete mineralization (i.e., CO 2 and H 2O) of the organic contaminan ts. However, to accomplish such results, high consumption of reagents is needed, which can be a barrier for their application on a large scale. Moreover, if the degradation is not complete, byproducts are surely to be formed , and sometimes they can be more toxic than the parent compound. Membranes Separation Processes (MSP) are also one of th e prove n systems that can achieve the desir ed performance on removing emergent contaminant s from water streams. Nanofiltration (NF) and Reverse Osmosis (RO) membrane s are a selective barrier to reject compounds with low molecular weight efficiently . Howeve r, some contaminants have similar properties to the membranes, thus high affinity, which can decrease the effectiveness of the MSP systems . Moreover, the intrinsic fouling on NF and RO membranes can modify the initial surface and facilitate the transport o f the contaminants through the membrane matrix. Keeping the processes mentioned above in mind, in this thesis , the Ph.D. candidate aimed to investigate the removal of emergent contaminants by applying MSP and AOP as a single process . The main hypot hesis was that the application of iron -based nanoparticles on microfiltration (MF) polymeric membranes could input catalytic effects and pro mote both separation and degradation , on a single pass, of the target compound trough the membrane , by", "oxidation reactions in situ . Furthermore, polymeric membranes when used as a support ing material might decrease the agglomeration of nanoparticles . Therefore, F enton reactions are expected to take place on the surface and throughout the pores of the catalytic polymeric membranes. However, as the nanoparticles are attac hed to the membranes , the catalytic activity c ould decreas e when comparing to their use in the solution. Photo-Fenton reaction s are also predicted to enhance the efficiency of the combined process (AOP/MSP) by generating more reactive species to degrade the target compounds . However, the presence of UV irradiati on might affect the polymer chains of the membrane . Another hypothesis of this current work is that bimetallic nanoparticles could avoid or increase the lifespan of the membrane under UV irradiation .", "1.2 OBJECTIVES", "The main goal of this work is to evaluate the efficiency o f removing emergent contaminants , such as bisphenol -A and 1,4 -dioxane, from water by applying nano -zero valent iron (nZVI) as the catalytic agent loaded onto polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes. As the specific objectives:", "• Evaluate the efficiency of different approaches of n ZVI in solution and loaded in PVDF membranes; • Study the best conformational structure of the neat PVD F membranes for nanoparticle ’s loading; • Investigate a new method for nanoparticle ’s loading onto PVDF m embranes, based on microwave (MW) radiation; • Evaluate the nZVI membrane, fabricated with the new method, for bisphenol -A degradation from water, accordin g to oxidation Fenton reactions; • Study the possibility o f working with the nZVI membrane, fabricated with the new method, under UV irradiation;", "• Investigate a new method for loading bimetallic nanoparticles (TiO 2/nZVI) onto PVDF membranes, by applying MW ra diation ; • Evaluated the degradation of 1,4 -dioxane from water by applying nZVI and TiO 2/nZV I membranes for oxidation with Fenton and Photo -Fenton reactions; and • Evaluate the reactivity and stability of the bimetallic membranes under UV irradiation.", "1.3 NOVELTY AND CONTRIBUTION OF THIS WORK", "A new method for nanoparticle’s loading onto polymeric mem branes was developed. Microwave (MW) radiation was used to polymerize and crosslink polyacrylic acid (PAA) in situ of the membrane matrix. The MW technique could enha nce the time needed to the polymerization reaction. For instance, the conventional thermal treatment needs at least 1.5 h of reaction, while MW radiation takes just 1 min. Moreover, the required conditions were facilitated, and as a consequence , there was no need for O2 environment -free anymore. Another topic of novelty is the impregnation of titanium dioxide (TiO 2) onto nano zero -valent iron (nZVI) membranes, also assessed via MW radiation, by dip -coating the membranes in the precursor titanium (IV) isopr opoxide ( TTIP ) solution . These bimetallic membranes were evaluated accordi ng to their photocatalytic activity for 1,4 -dioxane removal. The use of this compound can be considered as another contribution of this work. According to the literature, there is a lack of information about technologies that could efficiently remove it fr om water streams.", "Chapter 2. Literature review This Chapter summarize s the theories that rule the main processes applied to this thesis (Membranes Separation and Advanced Oxidation Processes ) for water and wastewater treatment . It gives fundamentals of the processes , acting as a groundwork for all the experiments and discussion ahead. It also presents an overview of the publis hed works that used th ese two processes for emergent pollutant remo val in water, as well as their combination. This stage was essential to verify the ne ed for developing combined processes to enhance emergent contaminants removal from water, as well as on overcoming some issues of membranes application, such as fouling. I t was also confirmed the possibility o f working with catalytic microfiltration membranes by their impregnation with nanoparticles . Besides, reviewing the literature helped in choosing the n anoparticles and polymers to work within this thesis .", "Part of th e literature review was published in the Journal of Water Resource and Protection in April 2017 , and it is displaced in Appendix I :", "Silva, L.L.S. , Moreira, C.G., Curzio, B.A. and Fonseca, F.V.

He described the permeation phenomenon of membranes taken from the bladder of the pork [1]. However, the replacement of the conventional filtration to Membranes Separation Processes (MSP) was driven by the need for improvements on water quality just after the World War II. Today, membranes are already established and used extensively in water treatments [1]. The MSP differs from the Conventional Separation Processes (CSP) as the fi rst ones can be applied as tertiary treatment ; thus, it is considered as a polishing process, while the second is usually used as primary treatment. The CSP works mainly by phase separation (i.e., thermodynamic equilibrium), while the MSP is based o n the m ass transfer between the different species presented in the environment. The MSP systems can be operated by applying pressure , concentration , or temperature gradient, as well as an electric field [1]. The use of membranes in separation processes is well -defined as a barrier that divide s two different phases and selectively retains the tran sferenc e of species between the phases [2]. Also, membranes are considered as thin -discrete interphase that control s the species during the permeati on [1].", "2.1.1 Features of m embranes", "Companies that fabricate mem branes for application on MSP sy stems can offer a vast type of configuration of the material, which can be applied to different goals . The choice of what kind of membrane should be chosen will depend on several factors, such as permeability, stability, chemical , and mechanical resistance , fouling, pores features, as well as the matrix to be permeated. The structure of the membranes ha s to be taken into consideration as well, which is assigned to its morphology, based -material, porosity , and geometry [2, 3] .

Classification of membranes Characteristic of the membrane Structure Nonporous -dense, porous or composites Symmetrical or anisotropic Material Polymeric or ceramic Driving force Microfiltration, ultrafiltration, nanofiltration or reverse osmosis Separation mechanisms Dissolution/diffusion, size exclusion or charge exclusion", "The structure of the membranes can indicate how mass transfer will occur. For example, nonporous -dense membranes have the dissolution/diffusion phenomenon as their major characteristic for substance separation [3]. On another hand, porous membranes provide separation by size exclusion . Therefore, the permeation is driven by convective flow [3]. Thus, the shape of the pores throughout cross -section can be highlighted as one of the essential characteristics of the membrane. Symmetrical membranes show randomly distributed pores, while anisotropic membranes m ay present unsystematic pores as well as be made by a mixture of polymers, i.e., blends [1].", "Membranes can be fabricated by different materials, which will classify them as polymeric or ceramic membranes. Usually , the polymers used for the preparation of membranes are synthetic organics , and the ceramic ones are from metals carbon or metal ox ides [3]. The driving force o f an MSP system will characterize the membrane as microfiltration (MF), ultrafiltration (UF), nanofiltration (NF) and reverse osmosis (RO), which the reported average The separation of suspended solids, microorganisms, colloids, and macromolecules can be obtained by MF and UF systems, which sometimes are used as a pre -treatment for NF and RO permeations [3]. NF membranes are used for the removal of enzymes, v itamins, and divalent salts, while RO can reach 99% of salt removal [1, 3] .", "The separation mechanisms between species can be driven by size exclusion (MF and UF membranes), dissolution (RO membranes) , or charge exclusion (ele ctrodialysis). Nevertheless, NF membranes can show all the three mechanisms at once, e.g., dissolution and size exclusion , as they can be a mixture of dense and porous substrates, as well as show charged active -sites", "As the main focus of this thesis is on doping nanoparticles into MF membranes, thus i mproving their selectivity for low molecu lar weight compounds, the next items describe the pressure - driven MSP systems.", "2.1.2 Pressure -driven operations in MSP systems. The streams of MSP that use the pressure gradient as a driven force are usually described as the feed, retentate , and permeate. The f eed stream is considered as the solution which contains the materials to be separated. The retentate presents a higher concentration of particulates or non - solvent. Finally, the permeate gives less content of suspen ded materials as well as a large portion of the solvent [1].", "The efficiency of MSP, in gen eral, can be evaluated by several paramet ers, such as recovery (Rec), rejection (R ej), permeate flux (J) , and permeability ( ϕ) (Eq. 1-4, respectively). Rec (%) = Qp J=𝑉0 ϕ=J", "The Rec is calculated by the ratio of the product flow rate (Q p) to the feedwater flow rate (Q) [1]. Rej measures the efficiency of the separa tion process by the ratio of the concentration of the target c ompound in the permeate to its concentration in the feed solution (C) [3]. J is the volume (V0) that passes through the membrane (A, area of the membrane) per time (t). Finally, ϕ is obtained by the ratio of the flux to the pressure gradient (P) [2].", "The MSP can be operated by two major types of flow, e.g., dead -end and cross -flow mode. In any case, the flux of the permeate must be constant when operating with just solven t. Once the feed stream is a solution or holds suspended materials, the parameters change significantly between both operation modes. This behavior is explained by the characteristic phenomena o f different separation processes. Also, it has a strong influe nce on the polarization of the concentration as well as the accumulation of materials on the membrane's surface, i.e., fouling The advantage of applying cross -flow operation mode is that it lessens the effects of fouli ng by swiping off the retained material from the surface of th e membrane. Therefore, a lower permeate flux should be expected when considering the dead -end mode. The last one has higher recovery, though, when considering the conversion per pass [5].", "2.1.3 Polymeric membranes preparation", "The literature describes several techniques to be used for polymer ic membranes fabrication, which the choice will depend on the characteristic of the raw material. Therefore, the properties of the polymer will affect the flux of permeation, the selectivity of the species to be separated, and the chemical/thermal properti es of the membrane. In addition, the features of some polymers can improve the fouling resistance while enhanc ing the stability of the membranes against chemical cleaning [2].", "In this current work , the P olyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) polymer was chosen to be the matrix of the membranes and work as a support for nanop article loading. PVDF membranes have also been reported to be suitable for this purpose since they can be operated in an adverse environment as they are thermally stable as well as mechanically and chemically resistant [2, 6, 7]. However, as a consequence of their hydrophobic nature, the memb ranes fabricated with PVDF show low permeability, which can diminish the overall efficiency of the process [2]. The structure of the PVDF mon omer is shown in Figure 2-1.", "Figure 2-1. Structure of PVDF monomer.", "As the hydrophilicity of the PVDF membranes is compromised due to the intrinsic nature of the polymer, additives might be used to enhance the flux of the permeation. Some works point out that propionic acid or PVP can increase permeation flux in polymeric membranes [8, 9] . Moreover, PVP additive can b e trapped by polymer chain entanglements imposing hydrophilic character to the membrane [8].

The method of phase inversion consists of disso lving the polymer in a specific solvent. The resulting CH3CH3F F", "polymeric solution is displaced on inert support to form a thin casting film [2, 3] . The subsequen t solidification process of the casting film is conducted by the destabilization of the polymer (i.e., thermodynamic instability) that leads to phase separation, in which one is poor (pores) , and the other is rich (membrane structure) in polymer conte nt [2, 3] . The control of the conditions of phase inversion and solidification steps enables different morphologies of membranes, as well as a variety of pore size formation. The destabilization of the polymeric solution can be induce d by different methods, such as solvent evaporation, thermal precipitation, vapor -phase precipitation, and immersion precipitation [2]. Comme rcial membranes are typically fabricated by the immersion precipitation technique, where the casting film is soaked in a coagulation bath that is rich in non -solvent [2, 3] . The mechanism is based on solvent diffusion from the casting film to the coagulation bath, while the non -solvent goes to the polymeric solution, and the polymer is precipitated . The rate of solvent/non -solvent exchange in the coagulation bath will also determine the morphology of the membrane. Usually, when this fl ux is instantaneous, dense membranes can be achieved, otherwise pores formation throughout the membrane matrix is expected [3].", "Other parameters that must be highlighted are polymer concentration, exposure to the environment air, humidity, temperature , and presence of additives in the polymeric solution [2].", "2.2 ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES (AOP)", "Advanced Oxidation Processes (AOP) are described as the technologies that aim to promote the generation of radicals to treat water and wastewater streams. These radicals are well - represented as •OH radicals that are highly reactive and , if operated in the best conditions, can achieve the mineralization of the organic compounds, i.e., degraded to CO 2 and H 2O [10]. Also, AOP is reported to decrease the quantity of discharging materials. Disadvantages of AOP: can be more aggressive than the primary compound; secondary reactions can occur if the process is not very well -conducted; the Fenton process can form sludge to be discharged [11]. •OH radical s are defined as trans ient specie s that need to be generated in situ of the reaction media, and it acts as a non -selective oxidant [12, 13] . The reported works in the literature select different species of oxidants that have high oxidation (V) and reduction (E 0) potentials (Table", "2-2). However, the choice of the oxidant will depend on the risk that imposes the population, environment , and the operation. As this thesis aims the generation of •OH radical s for organic contaminants removal from water, the following discussion of the litera ture review is focus ed on it. Regarding the reactions for the degradation of organic compounds initiated by •OH radicals, chain reactions are described to take place on AOP systems. Initially, the •OH attacks the compound to form organic radicals ( •R), fo llowed by several possible pathways, which will depend on the AOP system and the target compound (React ion 1-5).

For example, when Fe2+ is in excess, it can react with the •OH and •O 2H (Reaction 8 and 9). Fe3+ can also interact with •O 2H (Reaction 10 ).

Reaction 6 must be conduct ed at acid pH to favor the continuous generation of •OH radicals. Basic pH favors the presence of OH- and the formation of precipitates, such as Fe(OH) 2. Moreover, higher pH induces the decomposition of H 2O2, as shown in Reaction 15 [13, 15] .", "2H2O2→O2+2H2O (Reaction 15 )", "The p hoto-Fenton process is conside red as an improvement of homogeneous Fenton to provide extra •OH radicals by applying UV irradiation ( Reaction 16 and 17). Thus, both iron hydroxides and H 2O2 can be photolyzed and generate •OH radicals at higher pH [11]. As a consequence, the oxidation rate is usually h igher for photo -Fenton processes than the Fenton H2O2+ℎѵ→2•OH λ< 310 nm (Reaction 17 ) Photo -Fenton reactions also show as an advantage the possibility o f using fewer quantities of iron. Thus the generation of sludge is decreased for the same water or w astewaters streams when comparing to the Fenton process [11]. The energy consumption is higher, though.

Therefore, the advantages of applying iron particles, i nstead of iron ions, are the extension on the operational pH, lower initial concentration of the catalyst, and easier separation of the final sludge (i.e., possibility o f working with magnetic materials) [16]. The catalyst applied to heterogeneous Fenton is responsible for providing iron ions immobilized in its structure. The chemical reaction occurs in the interface of the particle/solution system, and the rate of the r eaction is proportional to the surface area of the material. For example, iron oxide microparticles and the reactions that might occur on heterogen eous Fenton is illustrated in Figure 2-3. The main advantage of this process is the maintenance of catalytic activity after the continuous use of the catalyst [16, 17] .", "Homogeneous Fenton reactions are also expected in these systems due t o iron leaching from the iron particle.

Therefore, the dissemination of nanostructured materials and nanoscience have shown high applicability on electronic, optic, catalysis, ceramic and magnetic fields, as well as on the synthesis of nanocomposites to other purposes [20]. Nanotechnology is thus defined as the study of miniaturization effects, and the manipulation of matter in the range of 1 t o 100 nm Nanoparticles present such specific properties that vary systematically according to their size . For example, nanoparticles minor than 20 – 30 nm have an excess of energy that become s thermodynamically unstable .

The tiny particles increase the ratio of surface/volume of t he material, and as a consequence, the atoms go to the surface of the nanoparticles , enhancing the reactivity of the material [20]. Another characteristic of the nanoparticle concerns the crystallinity, which can be amorphous or crystalline [24]. Nanocrystals are solid particles from a single cry stallite [22]. They have a thin layer on the surface that allows the adsorption of molecule s (i.e., core -shell model) [22]. This adsorption avoids the agglomeration of nanoparticles, keeping them disperse in the bulk solution [24]. This dispersion can occur by el ectric field or steric repulsion. The first one is reported that can stabilize the attraction of the species by the electric double layer formed between the ligands. On the other hand, the steric repulsion occurs in an organic sol vent, where the repulsive forces are a consequence of the loss on the conformational freedom of the ligands and the increase in the concentration of the solute [22, 24] .", "2.3.1 Synthesis of nanoparticles", "Two main ap proaches to obtain nanoparticles are described from the literature: top -down and bottom -up methodologies [22].

Due to its characteristic as a strong reducing agent, nZVI has been also applied for the dechlorination of trichloroethylene and polychlorinated biphenyls, as well as decolorization of dyes (reactive black 5 and reactive red 198) and removal of antibiotics (t etracycline) [26, 35, 66, 67] .", "However, due to the fast aggre gation of ZVI nanoparticles, which diminishes their activity quickly, the surface modification for their stabilization applying carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC), polyelectrolyte multilayers, smectite, polyacrylic acid (PAA), poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG), or po ly(methylmethacrylate) has been widely investigated [28, 34, 35] . CMC polymer features highly effective on nZVI stability, leading to nanoparticles with an average size of 10 –100 nm [32, 68] and maintaining or even increasing its activity up to 40 times on triazine removal, for example [69]. Another technique to avoid nanoparticles aggregation is their immobilization in different porous media, such as silica, acti vated carbon, resin, zeolite, and membranes [28, 32, 35, 42, 65, 70] . In membranes, for example, nZVI can improve the permeation process by lowering the deposition of contaminants in the membrane surface as well as increasing its hydrophilicity [70]. This composite material has been synthesized by different techniqu es (i.e., sol -gel process, in situ chemical reduction, and in situ polyme r action) [71], but the ion exchange rout shows high promise on increasing permeability (e.g., 116% of improvement with 3% of AlCl3 loaded in polyvinylidene fluoride -PVDF - membrane) and hyd rophilicity (contact angle diminished from 73.60 to 52.30 in ZrO 2/PES mem brane) [72, 73] . Moreover, nZVI composite membranes synthesized by the ion exchange rout show high stability of the nanoparticles owing to th e strong binding between the chelant agent active sites (i.e., PAA and PEG) and the nZVI [38, 41, 74, 75] . Because of the high promise on a stable material with a minimum loss of nanoparticles, these nZVI composite membranes have been used for degradation of metronidazole, metoprolol, trichloroethylene, and methylene blue as well as removal of metals, such as copper, nickel, chromium, bromate, and c admium, in water [38, 41, 4 6, 74 -76].

Size distribution ( Figure 3-1A) revealed nZVI/CMC particles with two major peaks at the size of 75.6 nm (width: 32.8 nm) and 417.7 nm (width: 187.1 nm), as well as the z - average diameter of 109.0 nm (Polydispersity Index -PDI: 0.483). As CMC polymer acts as a stabilizer to avoid nanoparticles’ aggregation by implying negative charges in the upper layer [32, 34, 65] , its presence as a nonreacted polymer in the sample solution could generate the double peak. This was confirmed ( Figure 3-1B) by the peak at 624.6 nm (width: 102.0 nm) and z -average diameter of 1067 nm (PDI: 0.633) for just CMC particles in the solutio n. The SEM image ( Figure 3-1E) of nZVI/CMC suggests nanoparticles with an average size of 60 nm. Applying the same technique, Gui et al. achieved iron oxides nanoparticles with 76 nm of diameter due to agglomeration effec ts [32]. XRD ( Figure 3-1C) also confirmed the reduction of Fe2+/3+ to Fe0 (α-Fe = 44. 70, 65.20, and 82.40) as well as the presence of Fe 2O4 (35.60, 56.90, and 62.30). The surface of the nanoparticles was revealed to be negatively charged at pH ≥ 3.0 ( Figure 3-1D), which can be associated with the presence of CMC (dissociation constant -pKa. = 4.0), present ing carbonyl groups (-COO−) dissociated [32].", "3.3.2 BPA and Dye Removal by nZVI in Solution", "nZVI has been widely studied for the oxidation of pharmaceuticals and herbicides because of its capabi lity of reducing dissolved oxygen (O2) and producing H 2O2, which reacts with the iron leached fro m the material to generate hydroxyl radicals (•OH) [28, 65, 79] . Generally, this approach was followed by deactivatio n of the catalyst in a short period, diminishing the efficiency of the system. Thus, to increase the kinetics of DRX - 6BN removal by nZVI/CMC, the behavior of a fixed dose of H 2O2 (0.1 g/L) at different nanoparticles’ concentration was investigated in this work ( Figure 3-2).", "The results show that increasing nanoparticles’ concentration from 0.5 to 1.0 g/L led to improvements on dye removal up to 36%, at 3 g/L reaching the best relatio n of nanoparticles/H 2O2 with 44% o f DRX -6BN removal within 4 h. A higher concentration of nZVI/CMC - 5 g/L - requires more H2O2 available for •OH formation, as a result, DRX -6BN removal was similar to that achieved with 3 g/L of nanoparticles. Reaction kinetics were further investigated ( Figure 3-2B), thus the data presented on Figure 3-2A were fitted to pseudo -first-order model according to Equation (1) , where C 0 and C is the initial (t = t 0 = 0) and final (t = t 0+i) concentration of DRX -6BN, kobs is the rate constant of pseudo -first order (h−1), and t is the reaction time (h). The kinetic removal of DRX -6BN was almost 8 -fold higher when the nZVI/CMC concentration increase d from 0.5 to 1.0 g/L (i.e., kobs 0.012 and 0.093 h−1, respectively). However, nanoparticles’ concentration at 2 g/L had a slight augment in kobs (0.108 h−1) compared to 1.0 g/L of nZVI, increasing to 0.138 h−1 with 3 g/L. Thus, the concentration of nZVI/C MC at 3 g/L showed the best condition for further exper iments, representing the least concentration of catalyst that gave the maximum removal response. Fenton reactions show high effectiveness on organic contaminants’ degradation [28, 63, 64, 79] . This is a result of inducing the generation of •OH according to Equation (2) , where Fe2+ is converted to Fe3+ by reducing H 2O2 [79].", "According to Harada et al. [79], ZVI nanoparticles are capable to generate •OH radicals by the corrosion of Fe2+ from the nanoparticle surface [79]. H 2O2 also generated by the oxygen presented in the solution ( Equation (3) ) will reac t with Fe2+ released to form •OH radicals ( Equation (2) ) [79, 80] . Also, Fe2+ leaching can be seen by the reaction between nZVI and H2O as in Equation (4) [80],", "When this process occurs at pH ≥ 7, OH− ions are in abundance and react with iron ions in the solution to form hydroxides or oxygenized species (e.g., Fe(OH) 2, Fe(OH) 3, Fe 2O3, FeO, Fe 3O4, and FeOOH), decreasing the efficiency of radicals’ generation [63, 64, 79] . Yet, the application of nZVI to these systems is suggested as a catalyst capable of inducing •OH formation in pH near to neutral by th e corrosion of the nanoparticle surface, which is mediated by the presence of O 2 [28, 65] . Furthermore, Harada et al. depict the behavior of nZVI and the gradual enhancement of •OH formation when the pH is decrease d from 7 to 3 in oxygenated water [80].", "To verify the role of pH on nZVI/CMC activity for organic compounds’ removal, Figure 3-3A presents the degradation of XRD -6BN according to different pH val ues at 3 g/L of catalyst and 0.1 g/L of H 2O2. The results show that at basic pH (9 and 7), just a slight dye removal (30% in both conditions) was achieved, whereas at pH 3, XRD -6BN concent ration dropped almost instantaneously (i.e., 78% in 5 min), reaching more than 99.9% of removal in 1 h of reaction. Kinetic constants were also calculated by Equation (1). In Figure 3-3B, the reaction with pH 3 show s kobs equal to 4.513 h−1, while for pH 7 and 9 it is 0.089 and 0.092 h−1 of k obs. These results imply that the pH is still a variable that must be taken into consideration for reactions with nZVI/CMC. It is worthwhile to point out that works that had appl ied nZVI supported in other materials, such as resins, bentonite, and PVP, could reach dye removals more than 95% at pH higher than 5.6 [28]. In those cases, adsorption phenomena could be involved, enhancing the ov erall results.", "Figure 3-1.

The removal behavior of XR D-6BN by Fento n-like reactions with the nZVI/CMC catalyst worked as a probe to the following reactions with BPA. So, to investigate whether the nanoparticles are efficient on BPA removal for further experiments with nZVI impregnated on membranes, experimen ts were conduc ted varying nZVI/CMC concentration at a fixed H 2O2 dose (0.02 g/L) and pH 3. High BPA concentration (800 mg/L) was selected to diminish adsorption phenomena effects on further tests with polymeric membranes.

Islam et al. correlated the mass gain of PAA/PVDF membranes to the AA content in polymerization solution and percentage of crosslink agent as well as the iron loading, reach ing a specific condition (e.g., 20% wt. of AA and 1% mol of acrylamide) for the ma ximum of iron in the membranes [70]. However, a comprehensive mechanism on iron leaching according to t he PAA functionalization degree and the effectiveness of these systems is still obscure for nZVI/PAA/PVDF membranes. In order to enlighten the role of iron leaching from nZVI /PAA/PVDF membranes, Figure 3-5 depicts different percentages of it and the correlated BPA removal. The results with 1 h of reaction ( Figure 3-5A) showed an augment on BPA re moval according to dissolved iron in the bulk (i.e., 17.5%, 24.0%, 60.5%, and 98.5% of BPA removal with 0%, 0%, 3%, and 4% of iron leaching from the membrane, for the 30% AA*, 30% AA, 20% AA, and 40% AA membranes, respectively). Non -detected residuals of i ron leachate could be involved in BPA removal for 30% AA prepared membranes. Adsorption phenomena are likely involved, representing 0.7% of BPA removal (i.e., experiment conducted at the same conditions but with P VDF membrane). Tests conducted with just BP A and BPA/H 2O2 did not present any significant removal (<0.1%).", "Longer reaction time (24 h) enhanced the overall BPA removal ( Figure 5B ), once iron leaching increased for almost all membranes (i.e., 37.2%, 51.5%, 82.2%, and 100% of BPA removal with 0%, 1%, 3%, and 16% of iron leaching, respectively). According to Equation (2) , Fe2+ must be in the solution to generate •OH radicals for orga nic pollutant removal. The longer time was also favorable to blank reactions, where BPA volatilization and adsorption was 5.3% and 14.5%, respectively. This behavior suggests that adsorption phenomena achieved the equilibrium within 24 h and during this ti me, BPA is subjected to volatilization. Considering the membranes which did not present increases on iron leaching (i.e., 20% AA and 30% AA*), the longer time revealed the diffusion resistance as a parameter that must be considered, once the target compoun d needs to adsorb into the pore’s material to be degraded by the oxidant species. These results confirm the", "decrease of n anoparticles’ activity when they are impregnated on supporting materials", "Figure 3-5. nZVI loading and BPA removal according to iron l eaching from nZVI/PAA/PVDF membranes prepared with 20%, 30%, and 40% of AA. 30% AA* = nZVI/PAA/PVDF membrane prepared with filtration o f AA polymeric solution.

As a result, nanoparticles’ loading increased (0.69 mg/cm2) compared to the membranes prepared with immersion in the AA polymeric solution (0.42 mg/cm2, Figure 3-5). Membranes prepared with 20% AA leached 3% of its impregnated iron (0.35 mg/cm2) and the ones prepared with 40% showed an increase in iron leaching from 4% to 16% (reaction time of 1 and 24 h , respectively). A specifi c combination of AA monomer and crosslink agent should be achieved in order to obtain the maximum deprotonated carboxyl groups for nanoparticles’ loading [70]. At the same time, the crosslink must be sufficient to properly entrap nanoparticles in the polymer chain and avoid leaching effects. A higher ratio of crosslinker/AA can dim inish the number of active sites available for nanoparticles’ loading, once the same carboxyl groups will be responsible for both nanoparticles’ adhesion and crosslink [32, 37, 78] . Thus, in this current work, the membranes with 40% of AA c ould not achieve the necessary degree of PAA crosslink (i.e., low ratio of crosslinker/AA), rapidly losing the nZVI impregnated, although nZVI inside the membrane was the highest (1.27 mg/cm2). Otherwise, 20% of AA could enhance PAA crosslink (i.e., there was no iron leaching after 1 h of rea ction) but lower nZVI loading. It is important to highlight the need for preparing a stable catalytic membrane, which could enhance organic pollutant removal without losing its activity. So, considering the percentage o f pollutant removal and oxidant diffu sion into the membrane matrix and their contact with the impregnated nZVI on the surface and inside the pores, the membrane 30% AA* was chosen for the cross -flow experiments.", "3.3.4 nZVI/PAA/PVDF Membrane Characterization", "Mem branes prepared with 30% of AA were c haracterized according to the techniques shown in Figure 3-6. The SEM image ( Figure 3-6A) reveals agglomerated nanoparticles on the surfa ce of the mem brane.

Howev er, this could not be confirmed by X -ray Diffracti on (XRD) once the PVDF polymer suppresses the signal from iron species. Nevertheless, FTIR ( Figure 3-6B) could", "prove the iron loading by the shift of C=O stretches from 1718.1 to 1557.8 cm−1, once nZVI is bonded to carboxyl groups from PAA [32]. FTIR spectra also present the -CF2- bond stretching (1000 – 1360 cm−1) without any change between the different membranes, which is characteristic of PVDF pol ymer [32]. The PAA crosslink could be evidenced with the appearance of C -O-C stretching vibrations in 1231.5 cm−1; however, this bonding is suppressed when the nZVI is loaded [81]. C=O bond stretching r elated to PVP polymer is presented at 1560.7 cm−1 on the PVDF membrane and shifted to 1652.3 cm−1 with PAA functionalization. This is an indication that PVP has some interaction with the PAA functionalized in the surface of the membrane due to hydrogen bon ds [82]. Regarding nZVI loading, the C=O stre tching from PVP remained in the same wavelength (1652.3 cm−1) as the PAA/PVDF membrane. The contact angle of the membranes was also measured, resulting in 43.70 for PVDF membrane and zero for PAA/PVDF and nZVI /PAA/PVDF membranes ( Figure 3-6D). This is related to the high hydrophilicity of hydrogels features like PAA [45].", "Figure 3-6.

As discussed before, nanoparticles can be a great advantage, especially when loaded in microfiltr ation membranes, once their major separation is driven by size -exclusion phenomena, imputing catalytic characteristic s for micropollutant degradation [32, 70, 83] .", "Results from BPA removal in convective mode are shown in Figure 3-7A. Interaction between BPA and PVDF membranes due to adsorp tion phenomena [84, 85] is illustrated with the reduction of BPA concentration (16%) after 3 h of permeation. When these membranes are loaded with nZVI, BPA rem oval presented a substantial increase, achieving 40% in 3 h, with the major activity within 30 min (33% of BPA removal). T his behavior indicates the generation of •OH radicals by nZVI in the presence of dissolved O2 and pH ≤ 7.0, as discussed before [79]. It also highlights the advantage of nanoparticles loading into microfiltration membranes for orga nic compounds’ removal. The addition of H2O2 to the feed solution had just a slight improvement on BPA removal (43% in 3 h). In this c ase, the major difference was within 15 min, where the BPA removal was 10% more than the process without H 2O2. As the H 2O2 concentration increased from 0 to 20 mg/L, so the reaction of Equation (2) was dislocated to the direction of product formation, increasing •OH radicals’ generation in the early minutes. Longer times facilitate nZVI deactivation by iron oxides depositions on the upper surface, as discussed before [32, 79] . The highest BPA removal for the permeation with 20 mg/L of H 2O2 could also be related to the flux of these membranes ( Figure 3-7B), which was lower (143 L/m2.h in 5 min; residence time = 10 sec) than the process without oxidant addition (295 L/m2.h in 5 min; residence time = 5 s). According to Islam et al., the residenc e time of the target compound inside the membrane is im portant to enhance oxidation reactions [70].

Moreover, when the nZVI is used in solution (i.e., experimental conditions: 1 g/L of nZVI at pH 5 and 20 mg/L of BPA), 16% of BPA removal in 1 h of reaction was reported [51]. Considering the cross - flow system working in batch mode with recirculation of permeate and retentate and the total volume of feed solution with 1.5 L, nanoparticles’ concentrat ion used in this work was 0.04 mg/L. So, even though concentration in the permeation process of ZVI nanoparticles is more than 1000 times lower, BPA removal is 2 times more than the reactions with nZVI in solution. These results could be due to the turbule nce intrinsic from the permeation process that enhances dissolved O 2 in the system.", "3.4 CONCLUSIONS", "nZVI/CMC in solution was evaluated for DRX -6BN and BPA removal and the results of the latter organic compound were compared with the efficiency of nZVI composi te membranes in s olution and the cross -flow system. Besides the high degradation rate of nZVI/CMC on the target compounds, when the nanoparticles are loaded in porous materials as PVDF membranes, their activities diminished substantially. This was confirme d according to th e percentage of iron leaching from the nZVI/PAA/PVDF membranes, where a higher concentration of iron species in the bulk solution leads to enhancement of BPA removal. Problems with iron leaching were addressed by reaching the best relation of AA/EG (AA = 3 0% and EG = 1% mol AA) and higher nZVI loading was achieved by filtrating the AA polymeric solution through the PVDF membrane. Diffusion resistance issues were also depicted as an important parameter for porous materials, which were overco me by conducting the nZVI/PAA/PVDF membranes in a cross -flow system.

The impregnated nanoparticles played essential roles in improving water flux through membrane s, increasing hydrophilicity, and extending the lifetime of the separation system via decreasing membrane fouling [71]. Among these nanoparticl es, carbon nanotubes (CNTs), metallic silver, and metallic oxides (e.g., TiO 2, ZnO, Al 2O3 and Fe 3O4) are among the mos t used materials [71].", "PVDF membranes have been reported as a suitable material for nanoparticle loading due to their properties of operation under adverse environmental conditions (e.g., various pH and salinity), as well as thermal and mechanical stability [2, 6, 7] . However, because of their hydrophobic nature, these membranes have shown low permeability that diminishes the overall efficiency of the separation process [2]. Functionalization with PAA has been a successful techn ique used to load the nanoparticles onto the surface of PVDF membranes. PAA is a polymeric form of AA with multiple carboxylic funct ional groups (-COOH) that act as chelating centers for loading of nanoparticles loading and also contribute to increase the hydrophilicity of the PVDF membrane system. Traditionally, PAA/PVDF functionalization is carried out via thermal treatment of AA -modified PVDF membranes, or via a dip -coating of pre -polymerized AA (i.e., PAA) onto the membranes [71]. However, the first techniqu e requires a strict environment, without oxygen, and long times (1 – 1.5 h) to achieve the modified membranes [70]; and the second technique is reported to be challenging due to compatibility of polymers, as well as nanoparticles entra pment and agglomeration inside membrane matrix [71].", "It is noteworthy highlighting that few studies reported alternative method s of polymerization and cross -linking of AA under MW radiation conditions [81, 86, 87] . For example, Jovanovic and Adnadjevic studied the application of conventional thermal heating and MW radiation for AA polymerization/cross -linking, reporting that the second could improve the kinetics of PAA hydrogel formation up to 43 times, once the ac tivation energy of the initiator decreased by about 19% [86].

However, using nZVI is typically associated with problems of nZVI rapid aggregation nature that diminishes its activity quickly in solution. Immobilization of nZVI onto membranes has been in troduced as a practical solution for nZVI aggregation in aqueous media [32, 38, 70] . Moreover, loading nZVI onto membran es improves the r ejection of specific contaminants (i.e., those with low molecular weight). It reduces the deposition of water contaminants on the membrane via catalytic self -cleaning that ultimately increases the membrane lifetime [70]. nZVI - decorated polymeric membranes are one of the recent advances in the water treatment field.

For all synthesized membranes, treatment with 5% PVP resulted in a much higher", "increase in their permeabilities (in the range of 7.2 -11.8x103 L/h.m2.bar) than when treated with 5 % of PA (ranging from 4.6 to 383.1 L/h.m2.bar). Previously, Han has reported the addition of 25.5 %wt./wt. PA resulted in 10.5 times enhancement in the permeability of polysu lfone membrane [9]. This was rationalized by the fast polymer precipitation after dissociation of Lewis acid complex (PA:NMP) by water molecules in the coagulation bath [91]. Precipitation of PVP as an addi tive polymer on porous membranes occurs by competition of nucleation and growth or spinodal decomposition mechanisms [92, 93] . In addition, PVP was partially entrapped in the PVDF matrix via polymer chain entanglement that has significantly improved the hydrophilicity of membranes. PVP has also been reported to be related to the presence of macrovo ids (or finger -like pores), as previously discussed in the literature [92]. Increasing P VP concentration up to 7.5% in this current work favor ed pore interconnectivity and generally increased permeability of the membrane under the same experimental conditions. For example, the permeability of 14PVDF/7.5PVP/T10 (37.3x103 L/h.m2.bar) was much h igher than that of 14PVDF/5PVP/T10 (10.8 L/h.m2.bar). A higher concentration of PVDF (17%) reduced PVP contribution, in which the further increase in the additive percentage (i.e., 5 – 7.5 %) has enhanced the permeability by only 7%. Thus, the following di scussion will be focused on 14PVDF/7.5PVP as an optimu m membrane.", "4.3.1.2 Air exposure of casting film", "Exposing PVDF cast film to humid air allows water absorption by the solution, that induces liquid -liquid separation at the air -casting film interface, which in t urn results in the formation of a tiny, porous layer on the membrane surface [1]. In additio n to that, the absorbed water promotes slow precipitation of the polymer and enhances the forma tion of symmetrical and evenly distributed pores on its surface [2]. This porous layer is responsible for selective separation of particles o r macromolecules with specific sizes in microfiltration membranes. Moreover, the pore size and pore size distribution of these pores could play a major role in t he functionalization/crosslinking of PVDF with PAA and further immobilization of nZVI onto the membranes.", "The impact of air exposure on the formation of porous 14PVDF/7.5PVP membranes and the corresponding permeability were studied at different exposure t imes (i.e., 0 – 30 min). Generally, high air exposure favored the permeability of the membranes (Table 4-1). However, long air exposure periods (i.e., 10 and 30 min) resulted in the formation of fragile membranes", "with low visible mechanical stabilities that rendered them unreliable for experimentat ion and further nZVI loading. Membranes subjected to air for 7 min showed permeability of almost 360 folds of those prepared without air exposure. Figure S 4-1 depicts SEM images taken for 14PVDF/7.5PVP at different air exposure times. The pore size on the surface of membranes was directly related to their observed mechanical stabilities and permeabilities, i.e., as the pores got bigge r in diameter (some of them interconnected on the surface) the membranes become more permeable, yet fragile, Table 4-1. For example, the membranes exposed to atmospheric air for 7 min (14PVDF/7.5PVP/T7) possessed 1. 0 µm average pore size and reliable mechanical stability. Increasing the air exposure to 9 min resulted in minor changes in the pore size and permeability of the membrane (14PVDF/7.5PVP/T9). The membranes exposed to air for 10 min (14PVDF/7.5PVP/T10) and 3 0 min (14PVDF/7.5PVP/T30) resulted in bigger pore size (i.e., 3.0 µm in average), therefore higher water permeability (37.3x103 and 30. 6x103 L/m2.h.bar, respectively). However, these membranes showed high fragility over use that rendered them unreliable fo r further studies. Since the corresponding pore sizes determined the permeability of the membranes, thus they are necessarily correlated with air exposure period. So far, the membrane prepared at short air exposure time (i.e., 14PVDF/7.5PVP/T7) was consid ered the most reliable for further investigations due to its relatively good mechanical stability and high permeability.", "4.3.1.3 Effect of coagulation bath on 14PVDF/7.5PVP/T 7 membranes", "The presence of water -miscible solvent (NMP) during PVDF synthesis was report ed to slow down the precipitation rate of casting film and promote the formation of big and well -structured pores [2]. Nevertheless, the dela yed membrane precipitation by NMP could lead to denser membranes [2, 92] . Thus, the selecti on of an optimum volume ratio (%v/v) of Milli -Q water/NMP in the coagulation bath was investigated. Results revealed precipitation of the casting film was only noticed at the water/NMP volume ratio ≥50/50 in the coagulation bath (Table 4-1). The membrane prepared at 50/50 ratio (i.e., 14PVDF/7.5PVP/T7/CB50:50 ) showed water permeability of 12.7x103 L/m² ·h·bar, while the maximum permea bility of 20.4x103 L/m² ·h·bar was recorded for the 70/30 volume ratio ( 14PVDF/7.5PVP/T7/CB70:30 ). Higher water /NMP volume ratio (i.e., 90/10) resulted in a lower permeability of 10.5x103 L/m² ·h·bar, which confirms the above hypothesis.", "SEM images taken f or upper and bottom surfaces as well as cross -section of 14PVDF/7.5PVP/T7/CB70:30 membrane, with the normal p ore size distribution are depicted in Figure 4-2.", "Figure 4-2.

The membrane exhibited a uniform porous surface with 0.6 µm average pore size. Figure 4-2C depicts the finger -like tunnels connecting the upper and bottom pores of 14PVDF/7.5PVP/T7/CB70:30 membranes. According to SEM images taken for membranes prepared with different coagulation baths (Figure 4-3), lowering non -solvent content from 90/10 to 70/30 ratio in the bath has led to the formation of more symmetric membranes, with interconnected and uniform pores across the membranes, which could increase the permeabili ty. The low permeability due to higher water/NMP (90/10) in the coagulation bath (i.e., 14PVDF/7.5PVP/T7/CB90:10) was thus explained by the increase of interconnected pores as well as the presence of macropores [2, 94] .

Under MW radiation, AA was suggested t o polymerize to form PAA that interacts with PVDF P membrane via hydrogen bonding between its carboxylic group ( -COOH) and the ketone ( -C=O) moieties from PVP on the membrane inner surface [82, 95] . Yet, the use of MW is typically accompanied by an unfavorable increase in medium temperature, resulting in primary chain", "scission reactions and less mechanically stable membrane [81, 87] . Therefore, applying MW radiation in multi, short time -based doses along wit h air cooling was suggested to relieve the heat evolved during the process without altering the stability of the treated membrane (i.e., annotated hereafter as PVDF MW). Accordingly, PAA grafting experiments, in the current study, were conducted by testing both continuous MW treatment an d multi -dose MW/air -cooling. Results of PAA conversion yield (Yield %) were considered as a measure for the efficiency of PAA grafting as shown in Figure 4-4.", "Figure 4-4.

Average error: 20%. 2x15 sec; “2” refers to the number of MW doses and “15 sec” is the MW dose time (i.e., total MW dose of 2x15= 30 sec), while air-cooling was applied for 30 sec between doses.", "The conversion yield of PAA (Yield %) due to 60 sec of continuous MW treatment, without air cooling, was 14.2%. More prolonged MW treatment (i.e., 180 sec) resulted in a not able drop in PAA conversion yiel d % (i.e., 5.3%) that was likely caused by the thermal damage in PAA molecular chains [81, 87, 96] . Mishra et al. observed a similar phenomenon of 87% reduction in PAA grafting on carboxymethyl cellulose upon incre asing MW radiation exposure from 5 to 7 min [81]. On the other hand, shorter MW exposure in this current work (i.e., 15 sec) did n ot lead to noticeable polymerization of A A, indicating the MW dose was insufficient to induce AA polymerization. With respect to multi -dose MW treatment conditions, 30 sec of air -cooling was consistently applied between the doses. Results revealed as the t otal MW dose increased", "from 0 to 60 sec, the PAA conversion yield was increased exponentially. PAA yields due to (2x15 sec), (3x15 sec) and (4x15sec) of MW exposure were 1.5, 4.5 and 19.4 %, respectively. Despite the same total MW dose applied, the PAA yi eld achieved by using (2x30 sec) MW treatment was almost half that obtained by (4x15 sec) MW dose. Again, this was due to the thermal damage on polymer chains and subsequent polymer interactions induced by a long MW dose. Grafting of PAA has been previousl y reported to be achieved by thermal trea tment methods, yet these processes involved high energy input and long treatment time [70]. On the contrary to that, the current MW -based method has proved its efficiency for PAA grafting in a short time, with high PAA yield without altering the mechanical stability of the membrane.

Due to the PAA/PVP bonds (i.e., hydrogen bond), the PVDF MW membranes could prevent detachment of nanoparticles [82]. Theref ore, in the current work, iron leaching was less t han 1% after 2 h of deionized water permeation in the cross -flow system. The PAA cross -linking can also exhibit an essential effect on fixating nZVI, where higher cross - linking is expected to diminish iron leaching, which can increase membrane lifetime. nZ VI loading onto PVDF MW membranes decreased even further the deionized water permeability to 607 L/m² ·h·bar. Effects like pore blockage and hydrophilicity enhancement are reported to depend on the size pore reduction and the increase in membrane permeabilit y by nZVI loading [37, 70, 105] . In this current work, the pore blockage effect shows to be more prominent on membrane permeability (when loaded with nZVI) than the hydrophilicity. According to Smuleac et al. [37] and Islam et al. [70], PAA functionalization can drop the permeability depending on the percentage of PAA in the membrane. Islam et a l. [70] reported that from 10 to 20 % of monomer, the permeability could drop more than 200 times when the membrane is loaded with iron. However, a ccording to the authors, loading PAA/PVDF membranes with nanoparticles resulted only in a slight decrease in permeability. However, others have shown that loading nanoparticles in membranes can dramatically decre ase the permeability by 137 times in compari son to PAA/PVDF membranes, as the nanoparticles can diminish the", "4.3.3 Comparison of MW radiation and thermal induced AA polymerization in PVDF membranes To verify the potential gain of MW radiation in PAA functional ization onto PVDF membranes, the thermal pol ymerization of PAA was also investigated. ICP -OES analysis revealed an amount of 0.5 mg/cm² of iron in MW nZVI/PAA/PVDF membranes, which agrees with the literature for membranes treated with PAA thermally (0.047 – 0.9 mg/cm²) [32, 37, 70] .", "However, the membranes that were synthesized with thermal PAA functionalization in this work exhibited an iron amount of 0.96 and 1.35 mg/cm² for TH nZVI/PAA/PVDF (membrane prepared in t his work by thermal technique, see Chapter 3 ) and TH nZVI/PAA/PVDFc (commercial membrane , Merck Millipore© - hydrophilic PVDF membrane, Ø47 mm, 0.65 µm , prepared by the same thermal technique ), respectively. This difference between nZVI concentrations might be related to the different yields of PAA formation. For example, the PAA polymerization yield was about 19.4% for the case of treatment by MW radiation and 46 .9% for the case of thermal -induced treatment for t he as -prepared membranes. The degree of AA polymerization is related to the quantity of AA converted to PAA. So, in the case of the as - prepared membranes, which had 83% porosity, the thermally treated ones showed higher yield with almost 2.5 times more con version of AA into PAA.", "Consequently, the amount of nZVI was 1.7 times higher in TH membranes than in MW treated membranes. Furthermore, it is important to emphasize that MW radiation excites the more pola r bonds, and in this case, would be the O -H sites t hat will favor the cross -link reaction with EG [81]. Therefore, it should be expected that nanoparticle impregnation on MW PAA/PVD F membranes will be less than on TH membranes.", "Differently, for the TH PAA/PVDFc membranes, the PAA formation yield was 67%. It should be noted that for these membranes, the pri stine membrane porosity was 73%. The commercial PVDF membrane has sponge -like m orphology (Figure S 4-3), while the as -prepared PVDF membrane exhibited fi nger-like pores ( Figure 4-3), suggesting that the lower available space on commercial membranes was f avorable to AA polymerization yield. However, the p resence of PVP in the as -prepared membrane can also play a major role in the adhesion of PAA on the membrane surface, as previously discussed in membrane characterization by XPS and FTIR analysis. This hyp othesis was further confirmed by subjecting the dif ferent membranes to water permeation. On the other hand, due to the PAA/PVP bonds (i.e., hydrogen bond), the MW and TH nZVI/PAA/PVDF membranes could prevent nanoparticle detachment [82]. In this case, the iron leaching was less than 1% after 2 h of operation in the permeation system. The PAA crosslinking can also exhibit an important effect on f ixating nZVI, where higher crosslinking is expected to diminish iron leaching, which can increase membrane lifetime.", "This last effect can also be verified by the results on iron loadings and membrane permeabilities presented in Figure 4-9.

Lower PAA adhesion and nZVI detachment from the membrane during the permeation process might be responsible for reducing the pore -blocking e ffect caused by the impregnation of nanoparticles.

𝐶= 𝐶ultimate+(𝐶0−𝐶ultimate)×𝛼×𝑒−𝑘t , (Eq. 8) where, C (µM) is the BPA concentration in the permeate at time t (min), Cultimate (µM) is the ultimate residual of BPA, α is the coefficient of variation from the ideal firs-order kinetic (i.e., the larger the deviation from 1.0, the less fit first-order kinetics), and k (min−1) is the reaction rate constant [106] . This modified equation considered the loss of available reactive nZVI and the concentration of contaminants during the diffusion, adsorption, reduction/oxidation, and desorption phenomena that occurred at the nanoparticle -bulk solution interface [38, 41, 106] . This modified pseudo -first-order model is generally accepted in the literature to calculate the kinetic constants of bare and nZVI loaded membran es used for environmental contaminant BPA degradation in the presence of 1 and 10 mM H2O2 encompassed fast decay rates in the first 5 minutes of the reaction, followed by slower rates thr oughout the remaining experimental period, Figure 4-10.

The maximum iro n release of 2 mg/L was recorded at ~2 h of the system containing 20 mM H 2O2. The fast release of Fe in presence of 20 mM H 2O2 prompted the rapid degradation of BPA (~48%) at 15 min ( Figure 4-10), yet, the degradati on proceeded further with significantly slow kinetics ( k = 0.140 ±0.017 min-1) due", "to the decreased concentration of nZVI on the membrane.

This was explained by the increased residence time of BPA at lower flux that resulted in improved membr ane efficiency for BPA degradation. Yet, excessive H 2O2 dose (i.e., 20 mM) resulted in decreased flux (164 L/m2.h) through the membrane and thus decreased residence time of BPA in the membrane that ended up with much less mem brane efficiency (i.e., 0.11).

The preparation of a hydrophilic PVDF membrane with well -structured pores and PVP as an additive was crucial to enhance PAA adhesion.

FTIR, XPS, and XRD analyses confirmed PAA polymerization/cross -linking induced b y MW radiation and further confirmed the presence of nZVI on the membrane surface. Experiments conducted in cross -flow s ystems showed promising results regarding BPA removal by nZVI -PVDF MW membranes. The applied pressure, flux rate through the membrane, pr esence of H 2O2, and residence time of the contaminant into the membrane pores were the controlling factors on membrane e fficiency.

According to other works, nZVI lose their activity quickly by iron oxides depositions on the surface of the nanoparticle [79] (Chapter 4 ). This phenomenon could be avoided by synthesizing bimetallic materials, in which one metal will be oxidized to provide electrons to the system while the other will be responsible for reducing it again (usually used for hydro genation) [32, 37] . Therefore, in the current study, TiO 2 was chosen as an electron donor to nZVI to protect its surface from iron oxides deposition, thus extend the lifespan of the nanoparticles. Also, it might oc cur a n increase in photocatalytic activity by generating extra •OH radicals from the electron -hole formation of TiO 2. The development of bimetallic membranes was carried out by evaluating the concentration of the precursor (TTIP) in an ethanol/H 2O solutio n and the time that Fe+2/+3/PAA/PVDF membranes were in contact with TTIP by dip -coating. It is expected that part of TiO 2 complexes with iron ions (assessed by MW radiation), and the other be attached to PAA active sites by replacing Fe2+/3+ or filling the available ones. Thus, the following subitems depict the steps conducted to achieve a membrane photoactive and with a desirable content of nZVI regarding the relation on the amount of nZVI nanoparticle inside the membranes.", "5.3.1.1 Evaluation of iron con tent on TiO 2/nZVI/PVDF membranes", "The dip -coating technique was chosen for TiO 2 doping onto the nZVI membrane also due to the possibility of a thin film formation on the surface of the composite material, which could work as a shield to protect the polymer chains against UV irradiation as well as to input photocatalytic activity to the material. The formation of the film could be seen in Figure S 4-2", "with the primary membranes tested with just TiO 2 in PVDF membranes ( i.e., 0.07 g/L of TTIP, 60 sec of dip -coating and 60 sec under MW radiation) .", "Iron content in TiO 2/nZVI/PVDF membranes w as used as a target feature of the composite material to guarantee a minimum percentage of iron.

Higher concent rations of TTIP led to minor content of iron inside the compo site membrane. For example, with 15, 30 and 60 sec of dip -coating, iron g/L, was 16.7 ±0.41, 17.9 ±0.17 an d 7.4 ±0.83 x10-2 mg/cm2, respectively. The variation on nZVI content in different TTIP concentrations could be due to the higher amount of titanium, which can enhance ion exchange (Ti4+ replacing Fe2+/3+) on PAA active sites [117] . Thus, as the TiO 2/nZVI/PVDF membrane, prepared with 0.00 7 g/L of TTIP solution and 30 sec of dip - coating present ed the highest content of nZVI, this configuration was chosen for following characterization and evaluation of DXN removal.", "Figure 5-2.

The average size of the nanopar ticles inside the pores is 32.4 nm, ranging from 8.5 to 86.3 nm. FTIR spectrum ( Figure 5-3E) does not show any differenc e between the PVDF and nZVI/PVD F membranes as discussed in (Chapter 4 ). However, when TiO 2 is loaded onto the nZVI membrane, C=O stretching from PAA (1557.9 cm-1) is suppressed, while the same bounding group fro m PVP (1670.7 cm-1) remains unchanged.

However, the absence of the diffraction peaks of any ph ase of TiO 2 may be justified since the concentration of TTIP was so low that it could not be detected. Also, the higher percentage of a semi -crystal line polymer (PVDF) could suppress the contribution of TiO 2 diffraction peaks.

By applying re gular two -level factorial design with two replicates, three center points, and three variables ([H 2O2] = 1 – 15 mM, [nZVI] = 0.04 – 0.5 g/L, and time = 0.25 – 3 h), the results suggest that higher concentrations of nZVI and H 2O2 (i.e., 0.5 g/L and 15 mM, r espectively) could lead to a maximum degradation of DXN, i.e ., below the LOD, after 3 h of reaction ( Figure S 5-3). Other works also attributed a higher DXN removal to the increase in the dose of H 2O2 [64]. It should be noted that the concentration of H 2O2 first tested in the experiments with nZVI/PVDF membranes were chosen according to the results obtained on the experimental design with nZVI in solution. So, the concentration of Fe0 nanoparticles in nZVI/PVDF membranes (0.49 mg/cm2) according to the volume of the reaction media (50 mL) gives 0.17 g/L of nZVI. In addition, the 1D graph interaction (DXN (C/Co) versus H 2O2 (mM)) generated by the results with nZVI in solution ( Figure S 5-4) suggests no major difference on applying higher or lower (1 or 15 mM, respectively) concentration of H 2O2 for DXN degradation with 0.17 g/L of nZVI in 3 h of reaction.", "5.3.2.1 nZVI/PVDF membranes und er UV irradiation and H 2O2 addition for D XN degradation Under UV irradiation, nZVI on the upper surface of the membrane might be a precursor of Fe2+ and induce Fenton reactions as described in Eq.1 and 2 [63]. More over, in presence of H 2O or dissolved O 2 (Eq.3 and 4), Fe0 can release Fe2+ as well, and provide H 2O2 (Eq.4 ), which will work as an oxidant for Fenton reactions [79, 80] .", "Photolysis of water molecules ( Eq.5 ) are also reported to produce H 2O2 (Eq.6 ) via HO 2• radical [63, 80] . In addition, H 2O2 can be directly photolyzed as described in Eq.7 , 8, and 9 [80].", "Regarding the nZVI attached to the polymeric membranes, experiments in dark conditions were conducted to evaluate the catalytic loss due to nanoparticles impregnation in a polymeric materi al. Also, photocatalytic activity of nZVI/PVDF membranes for DXN removal in aqueous media, were conducted in order to improve the efficiency of the system. These results were further compared to the efficiency of doping TiO 2 nanoparticles onto nZVI/PVDF me mbranes. Therefore, nZVI/PVDF membranes under dark and UV irradiation in presence of H 2O2 for degradation of DXN are shown in Figure 5-4A. Although the nZVI in solution could remove up to 50% of DXN by applying 1.3 mM of H 2O2 (Figure S 5-4), the same conditions but with nZVI/PVDF membrane could not provide any su bstantial results. The increase in the oxidant concentration by two times (2.6 mM H 2O2) in the nZVI/PVDF membrane sys tem had a slight improvement with 20% DXN removal after 3 h of reaction. The low contaminant degradation presented by nZVI/PVDF membranes s ystems with H 2O2 in dark conditions might be due to diffusion resistance of the compound and the oxidant inside the m embrane matrix, plus the diminish of active sites of the nZVI caused by its attachment to support material. Lower degradation rates of orga nic compounds are also reported for iron oxide nanoparticles doped in polymeric membranes and H 2O2 as the oxidant [32]. It should be highlighted that the reaction under the dark condition w ith the nZVI/PVDF membrane and 1.3 mM of H 2O2 suggests no adsorption phenomena by the contaminant in the polymeric ma terial.", "On the other hand, reactions under UV irradiation were notably higher than the experiments conducted in the dark, Figure 5-4A.

However, after 1 h, the reactions initiated with higher dose of H 2O2, i.e., 10 mM, started to show higher degradation rat es, reaching LOD after 3 h of reaction. Further increase in H 2O2 concentration, i.e., 15 mM, could not lead to a better result, since the extra content of the oxidant might react with •OH radicals in the bulk solution, thus, diminishing DXN degradation rat es.

Although t he generation of •OH radical was higher for the systems operated with 15 mM of H 2O2, DXN removal was slight lower than the systems operated with 10 mM of H 2O2. This difference confirms secondary reactions driven by the excess of the oxidant in the bulk solution, where the H 2O2 starts to consume •OH radicals instead of participating in photo - Fenton reactions [80]. Therefore, the systems operated with 10 mM of H 2O2 seems t o be more advantageous than with 15 mM when applying nZVI/PVDF membranes under UV irradia tion.", "5.3.2.2 TiO 2/nZVI/PVDF membranes under UV irradiation and H 2O2 addition for DXN removal The interesting results achieved by nZVI/PVDF membranes under UV irradiation tow ard DXN degradation led to a need for systems that could enhance even further the photoca talytic activity of these modified membranes.

As demonstrated for nZVI/PVDF membranes, 10 mM of H 2O2 with TiO 2/nZVI/PVDF membranes led to a maximum DXN degradation, i.e., below the LOD, within 2 h. Again, 15 mM of oxidant promoted secondary reactions, diminishing the efficiency of the system. Interesting results were observed by comparing both nZVI/PVDF ( Figure 5-4) and TiO 2/nZVI/PVDF ( Figure 5-5) membranes when applying 2.6 mM of oxidant.

In order to verify the efficiency of TiO 2/glass slide composite material, DXN removal ([DXN] 0 = 1.3 mM, pH = 7) within 1 h of reaction under UV irradiation was evaluated ( Figure S5-1). No difference in DXN removal ( ~30%) when applying TiO 2/glass slides prepare d with 0.007 g/L of TTIP under 1, 5, and 15 min of MW radiation was verified. Thus, higher TTIP concentration was e valuated (0.07 g/L) with 1 min of MW radiation, which provided a slight increase in DXN removal (35%). In all experiments, the previous 15 mi n without UV irradiation showed 5% of DXN adsorption onto the TiO 2/glass slide, which agrees with adsorption tests on SiO 2/TiO 2 composite materials described elsewhere [137] .", "Figure S 5-1. DXN removal by TiO 2/glass slides under UV irradiation. [DXN] 0 = 1.3 mM.", "Figure S 5-2. SEM image of TiO 2/PVDF membrane prepared with 0.07 g/L of TTIP (60 sec of dip - coating) under 60 sec of MW radiation.", "TEXT S2: Synthesis and application of nZVI in solution nZVI applied in solution was synthesized by using carboximetilcelulose (C MC, Sigma - Aldrich) to avoid nanoparticles aggregation and, thus, maintain their catalytic activity, otherwise t hey could lose its features almost instantaneously. Therefore, based on the literature [32] CMC was first dissolved in deoxygenated Milli -Q water (5 g/L, 100 mL) for 2 h. Therefore, based o n the literature [32] CMC was first dissolved in deoxygenated Milli -Q water (5 g/L, 100 mL) for 2 h. Th en, 20 mL FeCl 2 aqueous solution (25.35 g/L, pH = 5.5) were dropwise under sonication (150 RMS, 30 min) within N 2 purge to avoid iron oxidation. The reducing agent, NaBH 4, were also dropwise (50 mL, 7.57 g/L) to the system and sonicated for 2 h. After, nZV I were separated from the solution by a magnetic bar placed externally to the flask and then washed twice with acetone to remove unreacted compounds. Finally, the nanoparticl es were dried at 90oC in a vacuum oven for 12 h and stored under N 2.", "Right before using the nZVI for degradation experiments, the nanoparticles were resuspended for 5 min under sonication (150 RMS) with 40 mL of deoxygenated Milli -Q water in falcon tubes wrapped with aluminum foil. After, 20 µL of 2.6 M DXN aqueous solution and 1 – 15 mM of H 2O2 were added, thereafter the tubes were placed in a rotator mixer (20 RPM) for proper mixing.

Final Considerations", "6.1 SUMMARY OF THE EXPERIMENTS", "In order to summarize all the experiments conducted during this Thesis, Figure 6-1 shows an scheme regarding the nZVI experiments in solution, the development of hydrophi lic PVDF membranes , the development of a new method for PAA grafting, the improvements on nZVI impregnation into the membranes and their activity for BPA removal, as well as TiO 2 loading onto nZVI membranes and their activity for DXN removal.", "Figure 6-1. Scheme of the experiments conducted on this Thesis.", "6.2 CONCLUSIONS", "Several studies have associated the presence of emergent pollutants in water/wastewater and the ir adverse effects on the environment. I t is known that most of the emergent contaminants are persistent and show difficult degradation. Membrane processes, e.g., NF and RO, have been reported as promising technologies for the removal of emergent organic contaminants in water. However, this curr ent work could prove that functionalized catalyti c MF membranes could enhance water treatment as well. Because of the affinity of some organic pollutants with the surface of the membrane, some authors have associated the separation process with pollutant a dsorption phenomena on the membrane. Such adsorpt ion w as also confirmed for BPA in the cross -flow experiments in both high (800 mg/L = 3.5 mM ; Chapter 3) and low concentrations (50 µM, Chapter 4 ). However, DXN (50 µM) did not show any adsorption in the membrane (Chapter 5 ). Note tha t experiments in the cross -flow system were conduct ed for DXN removal (Conditions: nZVI membrane and [H 2O2]0 = 0 – 10 mM at pH 7) , and no removal was observed in this case. This different behavior on the removal of both BPA (hydrophobic) and DXN (hydrophilic) could be addressed as a consequence of the hydrophilicity of the contaminants and their inter action with the catalytic membranes . Before experiments with impregnation of polymeric membranes with nanoparticles, hydrophilic PVDF membranes were developed with the addition of PVP to enhance the functionalization . Finger -like micropores , along with the presence of the additive , presented a n excellent performance on PAA adhesion by hydrogen bonds. This step was necessary after the unsatisfactory experiments with commercial membranes .", "It was also demonstrated that when the nanoparticles are loaded in porous materials, their activities diminish substantially. Problems with iron leaching were addressed by r eaching the best relation of AA/EG , and higher nZVI loading was achieved by filtrating the AA polymeric solution through the PVDF membrane. It should be highlighted that in Chapter 3 , the configuration of the workable membrane was with AA = 30%. However, further tests (preliminary results for Chapter 4 ) showed that membranes prepared with AA 20% and with filtration of AA solution, could present higher concentration of nZVI per area of membrane . Therefore , the membrane with AA 20% was chosen to conduct the experiments in Chapter 4 and 5. Diffusion resistance issues were also depicted as an important parameter for porous", "materials, which were overcome by conducting the nZVI/PAA/PVDF membranes in a cross - flow system.", "A new method based on MW radiation for AA polymerization/cr osslinking in hydrophilic PVDF membranes w ere developed in Chapter 4 . Parameters as membrane surface properties, time of MW radiation, and intermittent radiation exp osure were essential to achieve a stable membra ne with a high percentage of AA conversion into PAA and minimal leaching of nanoparticle s. Experiments conducted in cross -flow system showed promising results by the developed MW nZVI/PAA/PVDF membranes on BPA removal, mainly operated at a lower permeate f lux. Moreover, it was demonstrated that the process involves •OH radical generation during water permeation, which favors organic pollutants removal by nZVI membranes. TiO 2 nanoparticles were s uccessfully loaded onto nZVI membranes by the dip -coating techn ique, followed by MW radiation . Photocatalytic activity of the composite material was thoroughly investigated under UV irradiation and several doses of H 2O2 at different pH for DXN degradation. Permeabilities of the TiO 2/nZVI membranes were verified after a prolonged time (1 week) under UV irradiation, and no changes could be seen, which is an outstanding demonstration of the feasibility of these modified photocatalytic -polymeric membranes. More over, the membranes could keep its activity more than 95% of DX N removal even after 5 times of reuse in solution .", "6.3 RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE WORK S", "Besides the significant findings during this thesis , and regarding oxidation processes driven by nZVI and TiO 2/nZVI membranes, some topics are still obscure. Therefore , some recommendations for future work s are herein given:", "• Investigation of different concentrations of AA for the polymerization/cross - linking driven by MW radiation; • Evaluation of ultrafiltration neat membranes in order to reduce the pore size, increas e the residence time, and , thus, improve the contact of pollutant and catalyst inside the pores ;", "• Study of the catalytic membranes in a different permeation system, which could have multiple or consecutive stages to enhance organics removal; • Investigat ion the TiO 2 loading by the same technique but with a higher concentration of TTIP at low acidity; and • Study the bimetallic membranes in a permeation cell under UV irradiation .", "References 1.

Among these substances are emerging micropollutants, present in both industrial and household wastewater in vestigial quantities, with concent rations ranging in scale from µg.L-1 and ng.L-1. Some of these compounds known as Endocrine Disrupters (ED) are considered exogenous agents that interfere with the synthesis, secretion, transport, binding and action or elimination of natural hormones in th e body which are responsible for maintenance, reproductio n, development, and / or behavior organisms [1]. Among the sources of these substances are pharmaceutical products, personal grooming products, steroid hormones, industrial chemicals, pesticides and many other substances. Many researchers have investigated the effect of these substances in water bodies, observing harmful effects on humans and animals, such as endocrine system anomalies, cancer, reduction of sperm quantity and endometriosis, among othe rs [2,3]. Furthermore, micropollutants can act synergisti cally with other substances, aggravating the negative effects [4]. Strategic programs for the development of detection protocols and regulatory laws that include the ED as imminent risk to the health of animals and humans have been proposed, including \"Two -tier Endocrine Disruptor Screening\" (EDSP -USEPA), \"Strategic Programs on Endocrine Disruptors \"(SPEED - Japan Environment Agency), and \" 21 Joint Working Group on Endocrine Disrupters Testing and As sessment \"(EDTA - OECD) [5].", "The presence o f micropollutants in aquatic environments has also been associated with the development of resistance to antibiotics by microorganisms. However, because of their low concentrations and wide diversity of types, the methods to detect and analyze micropolluta nts are not always precise, posing a challenge to wastewater treatment facilities [6,7]. Table 0-1 shows the route of environmental contamination by micr opollutants. Sorpti on in sediments of rivers, bioaccumulation and biomagnification can be considered, there are many works that relate these phenomenon [8,9]. Despite the difficulty of degradation, several reactions can occur in the natural environment, su ch as photolysis (b reakdown of substances by presence of sunlight), biodegradation (the presence of organic wastes favors proliferation of microorganisms) and hydrolysis (highly polar molecules). These reactions can generate active substances or biological ly inactive, e.g. t he natural estrogens are excreted by human body in", "idle and when incorporated into the environment so go to form active, may cause deleterious effects to biota around [2,8]. Another phenomenon that must also be considered is the volatili zation compound to the atmosphere.", "Table 0-1. Environmental contamination route by micropollutants.", "The technologies used by water treatment stations (WTS) and wastewater treatment stations (WWTS) are generally not effective in removing these micropollutants, because many are hard to separate and/or resistant to degradation. Compounding this problem, no monitoring is conducted for the majority of these contaminants, which are typically only present in t race levels [10].", "Theref ore, it is necessary to develop new technologies for removing micropollutants, to prevent their bioaccumulation and the consequent aggravation of the deleterious effects on human and animal health. Recently, membrane separation proc esses (MSP) and advanced oxidation processes (AOP) are becoming consolidated as effective technologies to remove micropollutants.", "The application of MSP, with nanofiltration (NF) and reverse osmosis (RO) membranes is growing among tertiary treatment method s, especially for use by wastewater/sewage treatment plants. The high purity of the treated water is due to the ability of these membranes to separate salts (RO) and organic compounds with low molecular weight (NF).", "The AOP, especially those involving ult raviolet radiation, hydr ogen peroxide and/or ozone, have been widely studied and found to be highly efficient in removing micropollutants. The main advantage of this process is the possibility of complete mineralization of the organic matter without genera ting secondary wastes an d sludge.", "MEMBRANE SEPARATION PROCESS Membranes are known as selective barriers that separate two phases and restrict the transport of various chemicals [11]. The most important property of membranes is their ability to control the rate of permeation of di fferent species [12].", "The separation mechanism depends on the type of membrane, the presence of pores and morphology or structure. There are three forms of separation: size exclusion (MF and UF), rejection by difference in solubil ity and diffusivity (RO) and separation by charge difference between species (Electrodialysis membranes). Especially for NF membranes, occur three mechanisms, because these membranes have dense and porous parts, as well as charges on their surface [13].", "According to Baker [12] t he mechanism of transport through RO membranes is called the solution -diffusion model. In this model, solutes permeate the membrane by dissolving in the membrane material and diffusing down a concentration gradient. Separation occur s because of the differe nce in solubility and mobility of different solutes in the membrane. The removal of micropollutants by MSP has been amply investigated, especially RO and NF membranes, which can retain dissolved salts and solutes, being adequate fo r the majority of microp ollutants that have molecular weight in the range of 200 - 400 Da [14,15]. When comparing the removal efficiency of RO and NF membranes, the former can retain a larger number of micropollutants, because their pores are smaller [14]. However, NF membranes h ave other specific features that favor their use, such as retention efficiency very near that of RO", "membranes, the possibility of working with greater flows and/or lower pressures, lower fouling rates and lower cost [16 -18].", "Table 0-2 lists the publications that have assessed the removal of micropollutants by MSP in different aquatic matrixes.", "Factors such as membrane properties, physico -chemical characteristics of the substances targeted for removal, transport mech anism and matrix effect should be taken into consideration when evaluating MSP [14,19].", "The membrane’s selectivity can be related to several mechanisms: size exclusion, electrostatic repulsion, adsorption, diffusion, solute -solute interaction and fouling. Simon et al. [20] assessed the adsorption of ibuprofen by NF and RO membranes and found that this phenomenon is directly linked to the electrostatic repulsio n between the pollutant and membrane and the solution’s pH. In other words, reducing the pH to valu es below the pKa (acid dissociation constant) of ibuprofen weakens the electrostatic repulsion, because the membrane becomes positively charged, facilitating the adsorption of ibuprofen inside the membrane, which has a negative surface charge. Shanmuganath an et al. [21] found higher removal rates (97%) of ionic compounds than nonionic ones (82%) by NF and RO membranes. Therefore, the diffusion phenomenon degra des the membrane’s efficiency in removing substances by adsorption. According to Sahar et al. [22] , the drug diclofenac was removed by RO membranes (negative surface charge) at rates above 95%, due to the electrostatic repulsion between the membrane and t his micropollutant. In another study, the same effect was observed when analyzing diclofenac and ot her drugs as well as personal grooming products whose charges are negative when in solution, such as ibuprofen, glimepiride, naxoprene and sulfametoxazole [1 9]. The removal efficiency diminished considerably for micropollutants having neutral or positive charges. For example, the removal was near 100% fornaxoprene, versus 20% for acetaminophen (neutral) and 60% for athenolol (positive) [23].", "In the case of ads orption, Gur -Reznik et al. [24] found that for some substances with low hydrophobicity and high pKa , such as carbamazepine and diatrizoate, the adsorption by NF and RO membranes is negligible, so the effective mechanism in this case is size exclusion. Lina res et al. [25] confirmed this possibility, indicating that hydrophilic compounds with neutral", "charges are only weakly adsorbed when fouling is not present. Cartagena et al. [17] reported the same phenomenon, confirming that in this case the higher the val ue of LogKow (octanol - water partition coefficient), the better the removal rates are.", "In contrast, Chon et al. [26] analyzed removal of sulfametoxazole (hydrophilic) and found that this adsorption should be considered, since even though this substance has a negative charge, when in solution the membrane removal efficiency is low. Further according to t hem, micropollutants that have neutral charges but high hydrophobicity are easier to remove when using NF membranes, which have negative surface charge.", "Ther efore , micropollutants can be classified into groups according to their pKa and LogKow values: neut ral hydrophilic, neutral hydrophobic, ionic hydrophilic and ionic hydrophobic [27]. In this respect, for a hydrophilic membrane and a substance with negative charge, the fouling phenomenon helps to retain neutral hydrophobic substances (because the adsorbe d layer on the membrane surface serves as an additional barrier) and ionic hydrophilic ones (due to electrostatic repulsion), as well as facilitating adsorpt ion of neutral hydrophilic substances [25]. Different types of materials are used to produce membra nes, but polymers are most commonly used for removal of micropollutants from wastewaters and sewage, because these membranes are less expensive, are versatil e regarding conformation and have high separation performance For removal of micropo llutants, the majority of researchers have used membranes made of materials specifically chosen to remove determined substances, such as polyamide membranes (Table 0-1). These membranes have a negative charge when i n contact with substances having neutral pH, thus enhancing their retention of negatively charg ed compounds. Other types of membranes are also used for different objectives, such as those made of cellulose acetate, which are frequently used to treat efflue nts with high concentration of chlorine, reaching salt removal rates of 99.5% in desalination a pplications [12]. However, according to Klüpfel and Frimmel [31], RO membranes produced with cellulose acetate do not have satisfactory performance in removing m etamitron, clofibric acid, atrazine and terbutaline.", "In order to improve the effectiveness of p olyethersulfone (PES) membranes for mi -cropollutant removal, Kaminskaet. al. [32] inserted “small amounts of single walled carbon nanotubes” in", "this membrane, wh ich increased the adsorption of bisphenol A and nonylphenol. But, the authors warn about that i ncrease of the pressure can diminish the removal, probably because the porosity of the membrane and the convection through it.", "Some authors have investigated the removal of micropollutants by MSP on industrial scale. Sui et al. [15] analyzed the removal of 14 compounds at four WTS located in Beijing, China. According to them, all were detected in the inflows to the stations, with the most abundant being caffeine ( 3.4 - 6.6 µg.L-1) and DEET (0.6 - 1.2 µg.L-1). However, they also observed that the station hav ing a tertiary treatment system composed of MF and NF membranes achieved removal rates above 90% for the majority of the compounds analyzed. The only compounds that were poorly removed were caffeine (50 - 80%) and mefenamic acid (0 - 50%). Investigating th e same types of membranes, Al -Rifai et al. [33] analyzed the removal of 13 micropollutants at a WTS. The substances with the highest concentrations in the inflow were salicylic acid, ibuprofen and bisphenol -A (6.3 – 38.5 µg.L-1). Despite these high incomin g concentrations, only the last was not removed effectively, showing concentrations in the permeate of 20 - 464 ng.L-1.", "Garcia et al. [34] assessed the removal o f 20 micropollutants at a WTS equipped with tertiary treatment with MF and RO membranes in sequence, finding that only ibuprofen and nonylphenol were not efficiently removed (< 30%), in contrast to the other substan ces (> 75%). Therefore, they decided to s tudy the removal of the two former substances in a pilot plant having a membrane bioreactor (MBR) system followed by a MSP system, alternating with NF and RO membranes. The authors observed removal rates of 99%. The y concluded that the deterioration state of the membranes directly affects the removal of micropollutants.", "The study of new processes on pilot scale provides important information, enabling the prevention of possible operating risks and extrapolation of c osts to industrial scale [16,29]. In this sense, various studies have investigated the treatment of effluents on this scale, with a growing number devoted specifically to removal of micropollutants ( Table 0-1). Dolar et al. [23] investigated the removal of several micropollutants by reverse osmosis after passage through a MBR and observed that all the target compounds were below the limit of quanti fication. Likewise, Cartagena et al. [17] obtained high removal rates (> 99%) of various", "classes of micropollut ants in the permeates from NF and RO membranes. Corroborating these two studies, Rodriguez -Mozaz et al. [35] attained concentrations below 16 ng. L-1 in a combined system of UF and RO membranes. According to the authors, the use of a MSP to remove micropoll utants can be strongly recommended, because unlike AOPs, there is no formation of byproducts and the process also serves as a barrier to possible microorganisms coming from the previous biological system.", "However, Sahar et al. [22] compared the removal of 11 micropollutants by RO after passage through two types of system: MBR and CAS -UF (a hybrid system of conventional activated sludge and ultrafil tration). The authors concluded that despite the high removal rates (> 93%), vestiges of the compounds analyzed were found in the permeate (28 – 223 ng.L-1) as a result of adsorption on the membrane. This suggests that the employment of RO is not effective , so other processes like adsorption in activated carbon and AOPs should be examined.", "Table 0-2.

These processes can be divided into homogeneous (catalyst and substrate or only substrate forming a single p hase) and heterogeneous (catalyst and substrate forming two or more phases, with the catalyst generally being a solid). In turn, the generation of hydroxyl radicals can occur in the pr esence or absence of ultraviolet radiation [41].

Ozone’s mechanism of action invo lves direct reactions (ozonolysis) or indirect ones (generation of hydroxyl radicals) and its effectiveness is related to the pH of the sample [45,46].", "Some micropollutants have been studied for treatment by ozonation a nd AOP, presenting a removal percenta ge for bisphenol -A ranging from 60 to 100% by O3 and 52 to 85% by S2O8 - /UV-C and H 2O2/UV-C (Table 0-4).

They observed that the efficie ncy", "of ozonation was related to the chemical structure of the compound, because the action mechanism of ozone is favored in the presence of doubl e bonds, C=C or aromatic chains with donor electrons. However, they did not observe the same results in compoun ds containing an amide group. Nearly all the compounds were efficiently removed (> 80%) with combination of the two processes, the only exception s being carbamazepine and diethyltoluamide. Hydrogen peroxide and ultraviolet radiation are used to degrade so me micropollutant in water and wastewater. The formation of HO• by UV/H 2O2 process occurs according to the reactions Sarkar et al. [52] carried out laboratory tests for removal of 5 mg.L-1 of estrone from water by different AOP, namely UV, UV/H 2O2, O3, O3/H2O2, O3/UV and O 3/UV/H 2O2. Under almost all the conditions tested, it was possible to remove 100% of the estrone from the water. Aguinaco et al. [53] conducted tests to remove diclofenac with ultrapure water in an acid medium by O 3/TiO 2/UVA, with initial O 3 and TiO 2 concentrations of 10 mg.L-1 and 1 .5 g.L-1, respectively, wavelength of 313 nm and contact time of 30 min, achieving 100% removal. In turn, Sui et al. [15] performed tests to treat the effluent from a WWTS after ultrafiltration containing from 100 to 1000 ng.L-1of the micropollutant in que stion. With 5 mg.L-1 of O 3, pH 6.5 – 8.0 and contact time of 15 min, the removal percentage was higher than 90%. Balci et al. [54] studied the Electro -Fenton process and concluded that 0.1 mM of Fe3+ with 4 mM of C u2+ was the most effective catalytic syste m in this process. Khan et al. [55] assessed the degradation of atrazine. They observed that the UV/S 2O82- process accelerates the degradation of this micropollutant in the presence of the radical sulfate (k = 2.59 x 109 M-1.s-1) and the radical hydroxyl ( k = 2.25 x 109 M-1.s-1).", "Silva et al. [56] investigating the removal of 17β -estradiol, 17α -ethinylestradiol and estriol by AOP and RO process observed that the H 2O2/UV (4 mg.L-1 H2O2 and 122.4 kJ.m-2) eliminated the presence of the two first estrogens and 91% of estriol. The authors concluded that AOP was effective although the membrane process, which couldn’t remove estrogens tested. WTS are among the leading sources of emerging contaminants, because they receive all the effluents from generating sources, such as residences, hospitals and factories. Many of these contaminants are not removed by conventional processes, making it necessary to use tertiary treatment methods, which can be used alone or in combination, such as nanofiltration, reverse osmosis, a dvanced oxidation processes and/or ozonation, solar photo -Fenton, among others [18,30,57 -61]. The use of AOP has been widely studied in synthetic water and surface water in order to evaluate the efficiency of remov al as well as the detection of degradation products and the kinetics involved [62 -66]. However, there are few studies that discuss the removal of micropollutants present in sewage, as well as the endocrine disruptors. Thus, many studies can achieve removal s up to 99 % of estrogens in WTS effluents , but it is necessary to study the best relation of the variants (like UV doses, H 2O2 concentration, O 3 doses and catalysts concentration) to avoid competitive reactions that diminish the efficiency of the", "Table 0-4.

THERMODYNAMIC MODELING OF FLUIDS AT CRITICAL CONDITIONS Gabriel Moraes Silva Advisor: Prof. Frederico Wanderley Tavares, D.Sc. Graduate Program: Engineering of Chemical and Biochemical Processes The modeling of uids in near-critical, critical, and supercritical conditions is a fundamental necessity in chemical engineering. The representation of thermody- namic properties of pure substances and mixtures in desirable accuracy is achieved through models that capture the di\u000berent phenomena exhibited by these uids in di- verse conditions. In the vicinity of the critical point, long-range correlations between molecules introduce uctuations that signi\fcantly alter the behavior of uids, which cannot be directly represented by mean-\feld equations of state. Aiming to correct this failure, we test two methodologies: the renormalization group theory and the Gaussian extrapolation approach. We study both approaches by calculating critical points, liquid-vapor phase equilibrium of pure substances and binary mixtures, and derivative properties such as heat capacities and speed of sound of pure substances. Our results show that both methodologies better represent the uid-phase behav- ior of the studied substances and mixtures in the vicinity of the critical point and supercritical conditions.", "vi Contents List of Figures ix List of Tables xiii 3 Renormalization group theory applied to the CPA equation of state: Impacts on phase equilibrium and derivative properties 7 4 The Gaussian Extrapolation Approach Applied to the PCP-SAFT Equation of State 28 vii 5 Comparison Between Renormalization Group Theory and Gaussian Extrapolation 60 Bibliography 68 Appendix A Appendix - Gaussian Extrapolation Approach 80 A.1 Gaussian Extrapolation Approach Derivatives . . . . . . . . . . . . . 80 A.2 Gaussian Extrapolation Approach Estimated Parameters and Errors . 83 B Appendix - Renormalization Group Theory 102 B.2.4 Equations and Algorithm for Phase Equilibrium Calculations B.2.5 Equations and Algorithm for Phase Equilibria Calculations viii List of Figures 3.1 Schematic representation of the Phase Space Cell Approximation method, in which the circles represent molecules interacting with each other, and at each step, correlations between molecules are summed in a way to include higher scales of 3.2 Helmholtz-free energy density corrections at each iteration of the renormalization method using the CPA+RG equation of state for 3.3 Vapor-liquid equilibria for methanol with CPA+RG in consecutive 3.10 Derivative properties for CO 2at the critical isotherm.

di\u000eculties inherent to its thermodynamic modeling", " This unique behavior is universal to many critical phenomena and is classi\fed as non-classical due to a series of modi\fcations related to a mean-\feld expected classical behavior (SENGERS; SENGERS, 1986", " Experimentally, this universal and non-classical behavior is observed by the mea- sure of critical exponents (CARL \u0012ES, 2010", " A theoretical approach to explain this behavior is that, in the vicinity of the critical point, the correlation length has the same magnitude as the system size, this implies the fact that long-range correlations start to become increasingly important in the description of the system, introducing energy uctuations of long wavelengths into the system", "", "These uctuations signi\fcantly alter the properties of the uid. This does not happen in conditions far away from the critical point, where the correlation length has the same order of magnitude of the diameter of the molecules, diminishing the in uence of long-range interactions, and thus, short-range interactions are more important for approximating the behavior of the uid to a mean-\feld behavior.", "Industrial processes need models capable of describing the thermodynamic be- havior of uids in a diverse range of conditions with plausible accuracy. In this sense, equations of state are versatile tools that, when correctly used, can represent the thermodynamics of uids with a good agreement with experimental data in con- ditions far away from the critical point. Many unit operations in engineering involve high-pressure or high-temperature conditions enough to lead substances or mixtures to critical states. Typical examples are found in the processing of natural gas, in which natural gas can form mixtures with CO 2and H 2S and frequently in conditions close to the critical point or supercritical conditions (KERMANI; MORSHED, 2003. Both cubic and molecular equations of state are commonly used in many ap- plications of thermodynamic modeling of uids in industrial processes, like the Soave-Redlich-Kwong (SRK) (SOAVE, 1972, Cubic-Plus-Association (CPA) (KON- TOGEORGIS et al., 1996, and Perturbed Chain Statistical Associating Fluid The- ory (PC-SAFT) GROSS; SADOWSKI, 2001. Even though some of these equations of state introduce the contributions of di\u000berent interactions, such as hydrogen bond- ing (as the CPA and SAFT equations of state) and polar forces (such as PCP-SAFT (GROSS, 2005; GROSS; VRABEC, 2006, qCPA (BJ\u001fRNER; KONTOGEORGIS, 2016 and CPA-G (SMITH; CRIPWELL; SCHWARZ, 2021), they retain their mean- \feld behavior, which makes them fail to correctly describe uids in the vicinity of the critical point.", "The lack of both classical and more advanced equations of state in describing uids in conditions near to the critical point can be shown by calculating their critical exponents. Non-classical critical exponents are observed experimentally to have values distant from mean-\feld equations. The critical exponent \f, has experimental value of 1=3 (SENGERS, 1974; WYCZALKOWSKA; SENGERS; ANISIMOV, 2004; STANLEY, 1999, while mean-\feld equations of state predict a value of 1 =2. To improve the description of equations of state towards the critical region, some authors tried strategies of reestimating the equation of state parameters including properties up to the critical point (PALMA et al., 2017; VINHAL; YAN; KONTO- GEORGIS, 2017b; MOINE et al., 2019; LUBARSKY; POLISHUK, 2015. However, these strategies do not alter the own nature of the equations of state, therefore, not correcting critical exponents and thus, failing to describe critical phenomena. Equations of state commonly used in chemical engineering are constructed us- ing mean-\feld theories, and therefore they average all the interactions and do not consider density uctuations independently. As uctuations become impor- tant to describe the thermodynamics of the system near critical points, equations of state fail. Many theories try to correct the nature of equations of state by in- troducing a non-classical behavior, such as those based on the Hierarchical Refer- ence Theory (PAROLA; REATTO, 1984; PAROLA; REATTO, 1985; MERONI; PAROLA; REATTO, 1990; MERONI; REATTO; TAU, 1993 and the Landau Ex- pansion (WYCZALKOWSKA; SENGERS; ANISIMOV, 2004; CHEN; ALBRIGHT; SENGERS, 1990; KISELEV; KOSTYUKOVA; POVODYREV, 1991; KISELEV, 1998; ANISIMOV et al., 1992; KISELEV; FRIEND, 1999; KISELEV; ELY, 1999 around the critical point. However, as equations of state are commonly used in engineering, they need to be physically consistent and not too much mathematically complex. The methods based on Hierarchical Reference Theory are, with consider- able frequency, not being much developed and applied due to their mathematical complexity. In contrast, the methods based on the Landau Expansion su\u000ber mainly from the large number of parameters to be estimated. Another category of methods is originally developed for equations of state by White and Zang (WHITE; ZHANG, 1993; WHITE; ZHANG, 1995; WHITE; ZHANG, 1998, based on the Kenneth G. Wilson Phase-Space Cell Approximation Theory (WILSON, 1971a; WILSON, 1971b; WILSON; FISHER, 1972 which is based on the Renormalization Group Theory. This method renormalizes the free energy of a given equation of state in a recursive procedure, which is calculated by a numerical method. The renormalization can adequately account for the density uctuations of di\u000berent scales, evolving from a microscopic to a macroscopic scale recursively. By applying this method, thermodynamic properties are better represented in the vicinity of the critical point without changing the original equation of state behavior far away from the critical point.", "Recently, some authors are trying to expand the knowledge regarding the mod- eling of uids using higher orders of perturbation theory (WESTEN; GROSS, 2017; WESTEN; GROSS, 2021; GHOBADI; ELLIOTT, 2015; ELLIOTT; SCHULTZ; KOFKE, 2019. From this, comes another strategy to correct the behavior of equa- tions of state which is purely analytical, but relies on approximations of molec- ular simulation of these higher orders of perturbation. One of these methods, the Gaussian extrapolation approach (GHOBADI; ELLIOTT, 2015, has shown to be a promising approach regarding its application to SAFT equations of state (GHOBADI; ELLIOTT, 2013a; GHOBADI; ELLIOTT, 2014b.", "1.1 Research Objectives", "The present work aims to evaluate the impact of applying the Gaussian extrapolation approach to the PCP-SAFT equation of state and the renormalization group theory to the CPA equation of state. A diverse set of substances and their mixtures were evaluated in conditions near and far away from the critical point. We included discussions on the development of the methods, parametrization, and the parameters to be estimated.", "1.2 Dissertation Overview", "This work is divided as follows: First, a literature review regarding the modeling of equations of state in the vicinity of the critical point focusing on the renormalization group theory and the extension of the perturbation theories is presented. Then, the methodology regarding the equations of state, the applied correction methods, and the parameter estimation is presented. Then, a section with results and discussions for thermodynamic and derivative properties for pure substances and their mixtures is shown. Finally, the conclusions for this work and suggestions are discussed. Chapter 2 Contextualization of Modeling Fluids in Near Critical Conditions Throughout the years, many authors tried to correct the equations of state in the vicinity of the critical point. Many methods have already been developed, but no consensus on the topic has been found yet. The \frst category of these methods are based on numerical methods, such as the Renormalization Group Theory. In contrast, the second category is based on analytical methods, such as those based on extending perturbation theories to higher orders. Although analytical approaches are generally preferred methods concerning ap- plying the equations of state to model thermodynamic properties, numerical meth- ods are always present, not always through the theory used to describe the uids itself, but within the algorithms used to calculate these properties, such as phase equilibria, for example. In this sense, numerical methods derived from well-based theoretical approaches have found room to be investigated and applied to correcting the equations of state towards the modeling of the critical region, such as those based on the Renormalization Group Theory. Although these methods are based on theories that correctly describe the critical phenomena, they do require extra parameters to be estimated that are not fully connected to molecular reality. Part of this problem can be explained by the fact that they also rely on the equation of state physical basis, which is sometimes semi-empirical in nature, as for some cubic equations of state. Further, these methods commonly require longer compu- tational times to be applied when compared to the analytical methods, which is also a downside.", "When the method was \frst developed by White and Zhang (WHITE; ZHANG, 1993), the correction was still impossible to be applied to a great range of density and temperature. This led to a series of modi\fcations by the original authors (WHITE; ZHANG, 1995; WHITE; ZHANG, 1998) and others (LUE; PRAUSNITZ, 1998a; LUE; PRAUSNITZ, 1998b; MI et al., 2004). Renormalization Group Theory has already been tested with several kinds of Equations of State, such as SAFT variants (LLOVELL; P \u0012AMIES; VEGA, 2004; FORTE et al., 2011; BYMASTER et al., 2008; TANG; GROSS, 2010; LLOVELL; VEGA, 2006a; FORTE et al., 2013; DIAS et al., 2009; LLOVELL; PETERS; VEGA, 2006; LLOVELL; VEGA, 2006b; LLOVELL; VEGA, 2007) and cubic equations of state (XU; DUAN; YANG, 2011; XU; DUAN, 2010; VINHAL; YAN; KONTOGEORGIS, 2017a; LLOVELL et al., 2008; QIU et al., 2006; CAI et al., 2006; CAI; PRAUSNITZ, 2004; VINHAL, 2018; VINHAL; YAN; KONTOGEORGIS, 2017b; VINHAL; YAN; KONTOGEORGIS, 2019; VINHAL et al., 2020; VINHAL; YAN; KONTOGEORGIS, 2021; SILVA; ABREU; TAVARES, 2020) with relatively good results. However, there is still a lack of knowledge on its applicability regarding other properties (e.g. derivative properties and mixtures thermodynamic and derivative properties) and how to include this method into the equations of state as to provide good results, which few authors have already researched on (FORTE et al., 2013; LLOVELL; PETERS; VEGA, 2006; LLOVELL; VEGA, 2007; DIAS et al., 2009; VINHAL et al., 2020; SILVA; ABREU; TAVARES, Regarding the analytical methods, there is a class dedicated to correct the clas- sical behavior of equations of state based on the Landau Expansion (WYCZA- LKOWSKA; SENGERS; ANISIMOV, 2004; CHEN; ALBRIGHT; SENGERS, 1990; KISELEV; KOSTYUKOVA; POVODYREV, 1991; KISELEV, 1998; ANISIMOV et al., 1992; KISELEV; FRIEND, 1999; KISELEV; ELY, 1999). These methods have already been applied to cubic (KISELEV; FRIEND, 1999; KISELEV, 1998; KISE- LEV; ELY, 2004) and molecular equations of state (MCCABE; KISELEV, 2004a; MCCABE; KISELEV, 2004b; KISELEV; ELY, 2000). These methods are com- monly termed \"crossover\" methods, and they use the addition of a term that has the critical exponents and extra parameters to be estimated. Although perturbation theories are theoretically extensive to the in\fnite terms, they are commonly used truncated at the second-order term (such as the Barker- Henderson (BARKER; HENDERSON, 1967; BARKER; HENDERSON, 1976) and Weeks-Chandler-Andersen (WEEKS; CHANDLER; ANDERSEN, 1971) to de- scribe dispersion interactions) or even at the \frst-order term (such as Wertheim's Thermodynamic Perturbation Theory (WERTHEIM, 1984; WERTHEIM, 1984; WERTHEIM, 1986a; WERTHEIM, 1986b), namely TPT-1, to describe association interactions). The reason is that these orders of magnitude are su\u000ecient to model uids far away from the critical point, in which density uctuations are not impor- tant. Even recently (WESTEN; GROSS, 2021), some authors still develop, revisit and try better to approach the solution to the lower order of magnitude. However, low orders of magnitude are not capable of describing properties at low temper- atures, critical phenomena, and higher-order derivatives, such as heat capacities (WESTEN; GROSS, 2017; GHOBADI; ELLIOTT, 2013a; GHOBADI; ELLIOTT, 2014a; GHOBADI; ELLIOTT, 2014b; GHOBADI; ELLIOTT, 2015; SASTRE et al., 2018; ELLIOTT; SCHULTZ; KOFKE, 2019) because of the inherent uctuations and interactions that need to be considered especially for these situations. There- fore, it is paramount to include higher-order terms of perturbation theory to model uids at these conditions.", "Considering higher-orders of perturbation theories is limited by the knowledge of the quantitative behavior and the qualitative behavior of these terms, limiting the necessary approximations to calculate these contributions. Usually, molec- ular simulation methods are used to study the behavior of high-order terms of free energy perturbation approaches to include high-order terms have been stud- ied before (BARKER; HENDERSON, 1976), however, only more recently there are data from molecular simulations available in the literature that calculate higher orders of the Helmholtz energy of uids with considerable accuracy, up to sixth- order, depending on the system (GHOBADI; ELLIOTT, 2013a; LAFITTE et al., 2013; ZHOU; SOLANA, 2013; PAVLYUKHIN, 2012; ESP \u0013INDOLA-HEREDIA; R\u0013IO; MALIJEVSKY, 2009).", "Here, to include the in uence of the higher orders of perturbation into the system, the Gaussian extrapolation approach (GHOBADI; ELLIOTT, 2015) is used, which relates to a convergent sum of the ratios of subsequent orders of magnitude, reducing the in\fnite sum of perturbation orders into a single term. This method has shown promising results in the literature (GHOBADI; ELLIOTT, 2015). However, there is still the need to further evaluate its capabilities and limitations, such as the range of temperature and pressure in which the method can be applied, and which type of phase equilibrium and derivative properties it a\u000bects.

Equations of state are very successful tools when used to calculate thermodynamic properties of uids far away from their criti- cal points. However, they fail in near-critical and critical conditions, in which uids undergo several changes in their classical behavior (SENGERS; SENGERS, 1986). Many unit operations in engineering involve high pressure or high temperature conditions in which many mixtures approach critical states. Common examples occur in natural gas processing, in which the natural gas can form mixtures with CO 2and H 2S and be found in near-critical states either at reservoir or at trans- port/operating conditions (KERMANI; MORSHED, 2003). Experimentally, it is observed that uids exhibit a universal non-classical be- havior in the vicinity of critical points, which is evidenced in the so-called critical exponents (CARL \u0012ES, 2010). One theoretical explanation is that, at the critical point, the correlation length is in the order of magnitude of the system size and, because only uctuations with wavelengths below the correlation length have an expressive impact on the free energy of a uid, long-wavelength interactions play a major role in the near-critical region. This mechanism gives rise to uctuations that imply signi\fcant changes to the uids properties. Far away from the critical point, instead, the correlation length is in the order of magnitude of the molecule sizes, thus diminishing the in uence of long-range interactions and giving the short-range repulsive forces a major role. Of special interest in this work is the \fcritical expo- nent, which is a constant that describes the vapor-liquid phase equilibrium behavior in the near-critical region.", "Equations of state (EoS) are commonly used to model uids involved in industrial processes. For instance, the Soave-Redlich-Kwong (SRK) (SOAVE, 1972) and Peng- Robinson (PR) (PENG; ROBINSON, 1976) equations of state are used in a wide range of applications. However, for some applications in which molecules are capable of making hydrogen bonds, these equations present poor performance in representing liquid phases, both for phase equilibrium and derivative properties. To overcome this limitation, Kontogeorgis et al. (KONTOGEORGIS et al., 1996) combined the SRK equation of state with Wertheim's \frst-order thermodynamic perturbation theory (TPT-1), such as done in the Statistical Associating Fluid Theory (SAFT) (CHAPMAN et al., 1990). The resulting equation of state (Cubic-Plus-Association, CPA) is capable of representing phase equilibrium and derivative properties of pure substances and mixtures with better accuracy in states relatively far from critical points.", "The lack of accuracy of classical equations of state in describing thermodynamic properties in near-critical conditions is evidenced by the fact that they predict a \fcritical exponent of 1 =2, while the value actually observed experimentally is 1 =3 (SENGERS, 1974; WYCZALKOWSKA; SENGERS; ANISIMOV, 2004; STANLEY, 1999). Strategies to improve the description of critical behavior by equations of state based on re-estimating parameters are somewhat common in the literature, with rather good results being achieved (PALMA et al., 2017; VINHAL; YAN; KONTOGEORGIS, 2017b). In all cases, however, due to the nature of equations of state one cannot correct the scaling of critical phenomena by simply re-estimating parameters.", "Equations of state are mean-\feld theories by nature and, hence, they do not treat density uctuations correctly as the uid approaches the critical point. Many theories aim at introducing non-classical behavior to equations of state. Some methods are based on the hierarchical reference theory (PAROLA; REATTO, 1984; PAROLA; REATTO, 1985; MERONI; PAROLA; REATTO, 1990; MERONI; REATTO; TAU, 1993), but these have not been frequently developed and applied because of its mathematical complexity. Another category of methods is based on a renormalized Landau Expansion of the free energy (WYCZALKOWSKA; SENGERS; ANISIMOV, 2004; CHEN; ALBRIGHT; SENGERS, 1990; KISELEV; KOSTYUKOVA; POVODYREV, 1991; KISELEV, 1998; ANISIMOV et al., 1992; KISELEV; FRIEND, 1999; KISELEV; ELY, 1999), which introduces a crossover behavior to the equations of state, turning them into non-analytical models with many adjustable parameters. A third category of methods, developed by White and Zhang (WHITE; ZHANG, 1993; WHITE; ZHANG, 1995; WHITE; ZHANG, 1998), relies on the renormalization group (RG) theory via phase space cell approximation. This method introduces a recursive procedure intended to renormalize the free en- ergy obtained from equations of state. With this approach, it is possible to treat the problem of uctuations in di\u000berent scales, evolving from the microscopic scale up to the macroscopic scale in a recursive manner. In this fashion, one is able to use com- mon equations of state to better represent phase equilibrium and thermodynamic properties in conditions that comprehend near-critical and supercritical states. Since its \frst application (WHITE; ZHANG, 1993), White and Zhang's recursive method has been improved by a number of authors. They themselves, for instance, extended the range in which the method could be applied (WHITE; ZHANG, 1998). Lue and Prausnitz (LUE; PRAUSNITZ, 1998a; LUE; PRAUSNITZ, 1998b) and Mi et al. (MI et al., 2004) improved the method so that it can be applied to a large temperature range, even far away from the critical point. Thus far, many authors have applied this method using di\u000berent mean-\feld theories (e.g. Mean-Spherical Approximation (MSA) (LUE; PRAUSNITZ, 1998a), equation of state for chain-like molecules (JIANG; PRAUSNITZ, 1999; JIANG; PRAUSNITZ, 2000, the SAFT equation and its variants (LLOVELL; P \u0012AMIES; VEGA, 2004; FORTE et al., 2011; BYMASTER et al., 2008; TANG; GROSS, 2010; LLOVELL; VEGA, 2006a; FORTE et al., 2013; DIAS et al., 2009; LLOVELL; PETERS; VEGA, 2006; LLOVELL; VEGA, 2006b; LLOVELL; VEGA, 2007), cubic equations (XU; DUAN; YANG, 2011; XU; DUAN, 2010; VINHAL; YAN; KONTOGEORGIS, 2017a; LLOVELL et al., 2008; QIU et al., 2006; CAI et al., 2006; CAI; PRAUSNITZ, 2004; VINHAL, 2018; VINHAL; YAN; KONTOGEORGIS, 2017b; VINHAL; YAN; KONTOGEOR- GIS, 2019; VINHAL et al., 2020; VINHAL; YAN; KONTOGEORGIS, 2021; SILVA; ABREU; TAVARES, 2020), and others (GHOBADI; ELLIOTT, 2013b; CHOI; BAE, 2016)), obtaining similarly good results. However, some aspects in the method are still unclear, including parameter estimation procedures and approximations in the renormalization equations. Hence, there is still need for further assessment of the method's capabilities and limitations. Few authors have explored the impact of this method into derivative properties (FORTE et al., 2013; LLOVELL; PETERS; VEGA, 2006; LLOVELL; VEGA, 2007; DIAS et al., 2009; VINHAL et al., 2020; SILVA; ABREU; TAVARES, 2020), and in all these cases no cubic equation of state was evaluated.", "The present work aims at evaluating the impacts on modeling phase equilibrium and derivative properties when applying the renormalization group theory with the CPA equation of state, referred to as the CPA+RG approach for short. We also evaluate a new parametrization regarding the renormalization parameters, in an ef- fort to try to reduce the necessary adjustable parameters when using cubic equations of state, which has not been tried before, this approach is referred as CPA+RG2. Therefore, the main e\u000bort of this work is to seek a methodology of applying the renormalization group theory to a cubic equation of state capable of representing both phase equilibrium data and derivative properties with a single subset of param- eters. We studied pure substances, as well as di\u000berent mixtures containing methanol, n-butane, CO 2and H 2S, in conditions near-to and far away from the critical point. In addition, we provide a parameter estimation procedure that improves the current described procedures.", "This work is divided as follows. First, we discuss brie y on the applied mean- \feld theory (the CPA equation of state) and the renormalization-group methodology. This is followed by details of the numerical procedures and parameter estimation methodologies. Then, we present phase equilibrium results of pure substances and binary mixtures, as well as results for derivative properties such as heat capacity and speed of sound. Finally, we present some concluding remarks.", "3.3 Thermodynamic Modeling", "Pure substances and binary mixtures in vapor-liquid equilibrium and at supercrit- ical conditions were evaluated using the Cubic-Plus-Association equation of state (KONTOGEORGIS et al., 1996).

This methodology is based on the method of Phase Space Cell Approximation developed by Wilson (WILSON, 1971a; WILSON, 1971b), where each iteration of the method introduces uctuations of longer wave- lengths. This procedure introduces a non-analytical correction to the equation of state. An illustration of the method is presented in Figure 3.1. Figure 3.1: Schematic representation of the Phase Space Cell Approximation method, in which the circles represent molecules interacting with each other, and at each step, correlations between molecules are summed in a way to include higher scales of uctuations.", "The renormalization-group theory introduced by White and co-workers (WHITE; ZHANG, 1993; WHITE; ZHANG, 1995; WHITE; ZHANG, 1998), and further de- veloped by Lue and Prausnitz (LUE; PRAUSNITZ, 1998a; LUE; PRAUSNITZ, 1998b), is based on a transformation of the grand canonical partition function into a functional integral. In the present work, we used the derivation provided by White and co-workers (WHITE; ZHANG, 1993; WHITE; ZHANG, 1995; WHITE; ZHANG, 1998), and applied it successfully by other authors for cubic equations of state (CAI; PRAUSNITZ, 2004; VINHAL; YAN; KONTOGEORGIS, 2017b; VIN- HAL et al., 2020; XU; DUAN; YANG, 2011). Details of the method can be found in the cited references. In brief, the interaction potential u(r) is considered to be divided into two main contributions, namely a reference term (related to short-range repulsion) and a perturbation term (related to long-range attractive interactions). Considering that the repulsive part of the potential accounts only for very-short- wavelength uctuations and that the perturbation part takes into account both short- and long-wavelength uctuations, the renormalization method is applied only to the attractive part. Mean-\feld theories are then used because we consider that they provide a good approximation for the short-ranged repulsive interactions and for uctuations smaller than a given cuto\u000b length L.", "As we are concerned only with the attractive part, to apply the renormaliza- tion method, we need to subtract the attractive potential already included in the mean-\feld solution, considering it to be a bad approximation since the mean-\feld theory cannot deal accurately with long-wavelength uctuations. This leads to the approximation wherefEoSis the Helmholtz free energy density calculated using the mean-\feld theory (in this work, the CPA equation of state), and \u000bis the interaction volume, in units of energyversusvolume =mol2, given by", "2Z", "whereuattis the attractive part of the potential. Because there is no explicit poten- tial for the CPA equation of state, considering previous work with both the SRK and CPA equations of state (CAI; PRAUSNITZ, 2004; VINHAL; YAN; KONTOGEOR- GIS, 2017a; XU; DUAN, 2010), the attractive part of the potential is correlated to half the value of parameter a, which here is considered as an approximation to the contribution of the attractive part of the potential (divided by the volume) to the Helmholtz free energy density. This leads to The Helmholtz free energy corresponding to the zero-order solution ( f0) is given by the mean-\feld-theory result subtracted by the approximated attractive term. Combining Equations (3.2), (3.10) and (3.12), the zero-order solution for the Helmholtz free energy density is bln(1+\u001ab)+\u001aRTncX i=1xiX Ai\u0012 lnXAi\u0000XAi The phase space cell approximation method consists of adding the e\u000bect of long- range uctuations through recursive steps, thus correcting the in uence of the long- range interactions on the Helmholtz free energy density of the mean-\feld solution.

These modi\fcations are made when the saddle-point approximation is used within the method's derivation (details are given in the work of Lue and Prausnitz (LUE; PRAUSNITZ, 1998b)). In the literature, these approaches were used mainly with SAFT EoS family, not being used with cubic-EoS. Still, successful results were obtained in the latter case. This is why we chose to apply Equations (3.10) and (3.21), instead. Here we considered that \fve iterations are su\u000ecient for the renormalization method to converge. To apply the renormalization procedure to mixtures, two major modi\fcations were made. First, the isomorphic approximation (FISHER, 1968) was used instead of the phase space cell approximation. The main di\u000berence is that, in the former, the total density of the uid is used to determine uctuations, while in the latter each individual component in the mixture uctuates independently. Second, although the isomorphism assumption requires that the chemical potential be the isomorphic variable, this is not a common independent variable for phase equilibrium modeling of mixtures. Therefore, following Kiselev and Friend (KISELEV; FRIEND, 1999), we used mole fractions as isomorphic variables instead of the individual chemical potentials. These two approximations make possible to extend Equations (3.13) to (3.20) by de\fning mixing rules for the renormalization parameters, which are L3=ncX i=1xiL3 and \u001e=ncX Other authors have used these approximations within the White and Zhang framework (WHITE; ZHANG, 1993) and have obtained good results (CAI; PRAUS- NITZ, 2004; LLOVELL; VEGA, 2006a; SUN et al., 2005; VINHAL; YAN; KONTO- GEORGIS, 2017a; XU; DUAN; YANG, 2011). Tang and Gross (TANG; GROSS, 2010) compared the phase-space-cell and isomorphic approximations using the PC- SAFT equation of state and concluded that both present similar performances. The substances analyzed with the renormalization group theory in this work (ei- ther in pure form or as a mixture component) are n-Butane, n-Octane, Methanol, Carbon Dioxide (CO 2)), and Hydrogen Sul\fde (H 2S)). These substances were cho- sen because of the di\u000berent associative combinations that they allow us to evaluate. n-Butane and CO 2were considered non-associative substances, while methanol and H2S are considered associative ones. There is an extensive discussion in the literature on the adequate associating models and considerations used to represent these sub- stances, mainly CO 2(BJ\u001fRNER; KONTOGEORGIS, 2016) and H 2S (RUFFINE; MOUGIN; BARREAU, 2006). A typical example is whether CO 2should actually be considered an associating molecule and to which extent the quadrupole forces are important (TSIVINTZELIS et al., 2011; BJ\u001fRNER; KONTOGEORGIS, 2016). In order to diminish the in uence of considered forces upon the renormalization pro- cedure, we choose to consider CO 2as non-associative. Quadrupole forces are not considered because we deem that, due to their nature, they deserve special attention. However, this is not the scope of this work.", "For all cases, the CR-1 combination rule is considered for the association param- eters (comprising arithmetic means for the cross-association energy and geometric means for the cross-association volume) because of its success in a good range of applications (FOLAS et al., 2005; FOLAS et al., 2006; KONTOGEORGIS et al., 2006a; KONTOGEORGIS et al., 2006b). Cross-association is considered when both substances are associating ones. The critical properties for each substance are ob- tained from the NIST database (LEMMON; FRIEND, 2018).

We have observed that 5 iterations are su\u000ecient to reach convergence in a grid of 500 density points. The number of points is enough for all calculations done here. Other authors considered even fewer density grid points (400 or even 200) (CAI; PRAUSNITZ, 2004). These numbers of steps and grid points were tested in preliminary studies (see Figures 3.2 and 3.3)). The renormalized results of Helmholtz free energy density as a function of molar density were interpolated using cubic splines (or bicubic splines in the case of binary mixtures), and their derivatives were used to calculate variables of interest in the vapor-liquid phase equilibrium, such as chemical potential and pressure. Before any interpolation procedure, the ideal gas contribution is subtracted and added after the interpolation.

We will consider a connection between the Lrenormalization parameter and thebbulk volume parameter from the equation of state, as both can be related to the diameter of the molecule. To make this connection, we will consider the estimation of molecule diameter using bmade by Travalloni et al. (TRAVALLONI; CASTIER; TAVARES, 2014) for the SRK equation of state. Details of the derivation of this estimation are given in the cited reference. Considering Lto be a multiple of the molecule diameter, we will use the following equation WhereNav is the Avogadro number, and Liandbiare related to the i-th component. We will thus compare these two approaches, an estimation of all seven parameters (which we refer as CPA+RG1 approach), and an estimation where Lis calculated using thebparameter of the CPA equation of state (which we refer as CPA+RG2 approach).

It is clear from Section 3.6.1 that the correction in the behavior of the uid when the conditions are near the critical region leads to a markedly distinct asymptotic approach to the critical point. As con- ditions go farther away from the critical point, the di\u000berences between the CPA-EoS and the renormalization approaches become less important. This result is expected due the fact that long-wavelength uctuations are less important at this point, so that the renormalization method does not introduce any changes to the Helmholtz energy. One observed drawback is that in all cases, but for the H 2S, the saturated liquid density calculation is inferior, which may be a result of a bad reestimation of the CPA original parameters. In comparing both CPA+RG1 and CPA+RG2 approaches, there is little di\u000berence between, that being more pronounced in the liquid density of n-Butane and Methanol, in which cases the CPA+RG1 approach had a better performance In Section 3.6.1 it is clear that the renormalization method has a tendency to slightly overestimate pressure.", "In order to have a clear comparison between the abilities of the two methods in estimating the critical points of all considered substances, in 3.4 we present nu- merical values of the achieved relative errors.

Con- cerning the isochoric heat capacity, the application of the renormalization ap- proaches did not change signi\fcantly the original behavior of the CPA-EoS, not representing improvements over the equation of state, in some cases, as with CO 2, we had a worse representation. For the isobaric heat capacity, however, all the model descriptions are better for the renormalization approaches when compared to the CPA-EoS, which now exhibit a behavior closer to the experimental data.

A marked di\u000berence in all observed cases is the fact that both CPA+RG1 and CPA+RG2 present a near-critical/critical behavior, whereas the CPA-EoS still predicts a liquid-vapor equilibrium behavior, which is character- istic of its overestimated critical point. Therefore, it is expected and clear to see that in all cases and derivative properties, both CPA+RG1 and CPA+RG2 perform better than the CPA-EoS.", "For the isochoric heat capacity, CPA+RG1 and CPA+RG2 approaches show a critical behavior, however, the original behavior of the CPA-EoS is still observed, which means that only in the case of Methanol it is possible to observe a maximum near the critical point (more pronounced in the CPA+RG2 approach). In the case of the isobaric heat capacity, applying the renormalization group theory brought Figure 3.10: Derivative properties for CO 2at the critical isotherm.

The calculated minimum for the speed of sound with the CPA+RG1 and CPA+RG2 approaches are closer to the experimental data when compared with the CPA-EoS, which is also another direct consequence of a better \ft for the critical point, as the renormalization method shifts it, it also shifts the the critical divergences, bring- ing the maxima for isobaric heat capacity and isothermal compressibility coe\u000ecient closer to the experimental divergence. However, for both speed of sound and isother- mal compressibility coe\u000ecient, the CPA-EoS still performs better at high pressures, and both of these properties have more in uence of the\u0010 @P derivative, this bal- ance can be seen as the values for AAD(%) for the three approaches are closer to each other. Therefore, considering the applied methodology where all parameters are reestimated, the renormalization group theory can correctly describe the vicinity of the critical point, however it may impair the description at high pressures. Supercritical conditions For supercritical conditions, results are shown in Figure 3.11. The same adjustments are observed for the isochoric heat capacity. The critical divergence observed in experimental data is still not captured when applying the renormalization group theory, although the representation is improved. The most pronounced change was observed for the CPA+RG2 approach in the Methanol case. Figure 3.11: Derivative properties for CO 2at supercritical conditions. Symbols and For the isobaric heat capacity, the same observations made for the critical isotherm are again observed, with the renormalization approaches better describing the experimental data. Regarding the speed of sound and isothermal compressibil- ity coe\u000ecients, there is an improvement in describing the data in the vicinity of the critical point; however, in higher pressures, the CPA-EoS has a better description (with the exception of n-Butane and CO 2, where the renormalization approach still performs better). As a result, AAD(%) values are higher for the renormalization approaches regarding the isothermal compressibility coe\u000ecient at these conditions, whereas the AAD(%) is better for the speed of sound. As it is shown, overall, the renormalization method implies more pronounced changes when we are near the critical point. These results can be expected because of two main reasons. First, as we apply the method, there is a shift to the critical point calculated by the equation of state, approximating it to the experimental one and therefore changing the derivative properties curves nearer to the experimental data. Second, the method corrects the classical behavior of the equations of state, bringing the characteristic non-classical behavior of the experimental data to the model, therefore approximating the behavior of the derivative properties calculated by the model to the experimental data. However, there is still some disagreement between the model with renormalization and experimental data. There is the need for further investigation on this topic to \fnd the roots of this disagreement, evaluating other substances and equations of state.", "In this work, it is clear that, as observed by other authors for SAFT-type equa- tions of state (LLOVELL; VEGA, 2006b), the renormalization parameters obtained by \ftting liquid-vapor phase equilibrium data can be used to describe better second- order derivative properties, which enhances the transferability of the parameters. Also, in all observed cases in this work, for all conditions, the renormalization ap- proach still lacks a good qualitative and quantitative description of the isochoric heat capacity; therefore, applying a kernel term as applied by Llovell et al. (LLOVELL et al., 2015) for the Soft-SAFT equation of state may also be a good route for cubic equations of state, as it was capable to enhance the capabilities fo the equation of state regardin this property.", "3.7 Partial Conclusions", "The applied renormalization-group methodology is capable of improving the mod- eling of phase equilibrium at conditions near to and at the critical point without a\u000becting the description given by the equation of state far away from this condi- tion. In all cases, the model behavior is improved when compared to experimental data, correcting critical exponents and introducing the expected asymptotic behav- ior to the uid near the critical point. A signi\fcant advantage of the implemented method is that binary mixture calculations are computationally simple. Its only major drawback is the introduction of two extra parameters per substance. How- ever, as we observed comparing the RG1 and RG2 approaches, it was possible to use a correlation for the Lparameter without impairing the results for renormalization group methodology, which reduces the number of necessary adjustable parameters. We had problems regarding the liquid density and saturation pressure curve using the RG2 approach for Methanol, which was not the case for the other substances. It would be interesting to evaluate other correlations for the diameter of the molecules in order to try to cover the problems faced with the RG2 approach. It is worth noting that the RG2 approach is readily extensible to other cubic equations of state (e.g., SRK and PR).", "Considering derivative properties, the renormalization approach represented im- provements over the sole equation of state. In order to better model the isochoric heat capacity, other approaches are still necessary. It might be necessary to do a parameter estimation using this data to see if the renormalization group theory can correctly capture this divergence. As we observed a local minima problem in the parameter estimation, it is desirable to use a global search algorithm together with a local search algorithm, such as the PSO method combined with the Nelder-Mead algorithm used in this work.", "Our results suggest that the used renormalization-group methodology, together with the CPA equation of state, is a better tool than the CPA equation alone to describe both phase equilibrium and derivative properties of pure substances, as well as binary mixtures, in a large range of conditions, from subcritical up to supercritical ones.", "Chapter 4 The Gaussian Extrapolation Approach Applied to the PCP-SAFT Equation of State", "4.1 Introduction", "Although perturbation theories are extensive to the in\fnite terms, they are com- monly used truncated. Examples are the second-order term of the Barker-Henderson (BARKER; HENDERSON, 1967; BARKER; HENDERSON, 1976) and Weeks- Chandler-Andersen (WEEKS; CHANDLER; ANDERSEN, 1971), to describe dis- persion interactions, and the \frst-order term of the Wertheim's Thermodynamic Perturbation Theory (WERTHEIM, 1984; WERTHEIM, 1984; WERTHEIM, 1986a; WERTHEIM, 1986b), namely TPT-1, to describe association interactions because these orders of magnitude are su\u000ecient to model uids far away from the critical point, in which density uctuations are not relevant. Even recently (WESTEN; GROSS, 2021 some authors still develop, revisit and try to approach the solu- tion better using lower orders of magnitude. However, low orders of magnitude are not capable of describing low density and temperature behavior, critical phe- nomena, and higher-order derivatives, such as heat capacities (WESTEN; GROSS, 2017; GHOBADI; ELLIOTT, 2013a; GHOBADI; ELLIOTT, 2014a; GHOBADI; ELLIOTT, 2014b; GHOBADI; ELLIOTT, 2015; SASTRE et al., 2018; ELLIOTT; SCHULTZ; KOFKE, 2019) because of the inherent uctuations and interactions that need to be considered especially for these situations. Therefore, it is of paramount necessity to describe higher-order terms of perturbation theory to model uids at these conditions.", "Extending perturbation theories to higher-order terms is limited by the knowl- edge of the quantitative and the qualitative behavior of these contributions, limiting the necessary approximations to calculate these contributions. Usually, molecular simulation methods are used to approach the behavior of higher-order terms of free energy perturbation, and despite approaches to extend perturbation theories some- times range from since the date of their publications (BARKER; HENDERSON, 1976), only more recently there are available in the literature data from molecular simulations to calculate higher orders of the helmholtz energy of uids (GHOBADI; ELLIOTT, 2013a; LAFITTE et al., 2013; ZHOU; SOLANA, 2013; PAVLYUKHIN, 2012; ESP \u0013INDOLA-HEREDIA; R \u0013IO; MALIJEVSKY, 2009). In order to include these higher-order terms of perturbation into the system, some approximations may be used. For instance, the Gaussian extrapolation ap- proach (GHOBADI; ELLIOTT, 2015) is a simple extrapolation regarding the ratios of subsequent orders of magnitude. These ratios are used in the perturbation the- ory to reduce the in\fnite sum into a single term. This method has shown to be a promising approach as it is analytical; however, there is still a need to evaluate its capabilities and limitations further.", "The present work aims to evaluate the impact of applying the Gaussian extrap- olation approach to the PCP-SAFT equation of state A diverse set of substances were evaluated in conditions near to and far away from the critical point, including discussions on the development of the methods, parametrization approaches to the parameters to be estimated.", "4.2 Thermodynamic Modeling", "4.2.1 Equation of State", "Our equation of state revolves around expanding the dispersion contribution term of the PCP-SAFT equation of state (GROSS; SADOWSKI, 2001; GROSS; SAD- OWSKI, 2002), which is calculated using Barker-Henderson (BH) Perturbation The- ory (BARKER; HENDERSON, 1967) truncated at the second-order term.

A marked di\u000berence between the PC-SAFT and the SAFT- equations of state lies within the perturbation theory. Dispersion interactions are described in the PC-SAFT equation of state via the BH Perturbation Theory (BARKER; HENDERSON, 1967), while the SAFT- equation of state makes use of the Weeks-Chandler-Andersen Perturbation Theory (WEEKS; CHANDLER; ANDERSEN, 1971).", "Despite this di\u000berence, Ghobadi and Elliott (GHOBADI; ELLIOTT, 2015) ap- plied the Gaussian Extrapolation with success to the PC-SAFT equation of state. Previous works tried to include higher-order terms of the BH Perturbation The- ory into a Helmholtz energy contribution (BARKER; HENDERSON, 1976; SPAN; WAGNER, 1996; CHOU; PRAUSNITZ, 1989). However, these developments did not conceivably connect molecular simulation of Perturbation Theory to e\u000bectively model the critical region successfully, such as Ghobadi and Elliott (GHOBADI; EL- LIOTT, 2015). In their method, from the results obtained for uids described by the square-well spheres, the ratios between AiandAi\u00001perturbations can be de- scribed by a Gaussian, here termed as G. Considering the approximation that these Gaussians have a universal peak value at \u00110, independently of the ratio of orders of the perturbation, and also that a Gaussian Gcan approximately describe all ratios, we can assume that i Ai kTexp\u0002 whereG0,G1and\u00110are adjustable parameters, and \u0011is the packing fraction. We regard that the BH perturbation theory, if not truncated at the second-order, can be represented by Apert NkT=A1 NkT+A2 NkT\u0012 A2A4 Applying Equation (4.4) in Equation (4.5) we obtain Apert NkT=A1 NkT+A2 NkT\u0012 and rearranging Equation (4.6), we come to Apert NkT=A1 NkT+A2 NkT\u0014 where the term inside parenthesis of Equation (4.7) can be summed up to in\fnite order in closed form, which gives Apert NkT=A1 NkT+A2 NkT\u0014 Now that we have described the perturbation contribution accounting with orders up to the in\fnite order summed at Equation (4.8), we have our \fnal equation of state. This new version of the PCP-SAFT equation of state, considering the Gaussian extrapolation approach, is named as PCP-SAFT-2G. In order to further clarify and extend already implemented versions of SAFT, we split the Equation (4.8) into two main contributions, the \frst one comprising the original perturbation theory up to the second-order term Adisp(which are already known and described originally for the PCP-SAFT equation of state), and the new one considering the in uence of higher-order contributions, calculated using the Gaussian extrapolation approach AGE, Apert NkT=Adisp NkT+AGE", ". whereAGEis given by", "AGE NkT=A2 NkT2 To apply the Gaussian extrapolation approach to the PC-SAFT or PCP-SAFT equations of state, we add the Gaussian extrapolation contribution using Equa- tion (4.10).

Also, this mixing rule does not consider the in uence that, in an A-B mixture, the presence of substance B would have in the A-A uctuations and vice-versa.", "This mixing rule is closer to the Phase-Space Cell Approximation idea devel- oped by Kenneth G. Wilson (WILSON, 1971a; WILSON, 1971b), in which molecule uctuations can be considered independently to the whole mixture uctuations, in contrast to the Isomorphic Approximation, where the mixture has to be considered as a one-component uid with properties of its own. Here, we use the mixing rule de\fned in Equation (4.11).", "4.3 Parameter Estimation", "Although perturbation theories fail to describe thermodynamic properties both in the near-critical region and at very low temperatures systematically, in this work, we only consider corrections towards the near-critical region using information from the critical point to apply this correction, and test the predictability of the extended equation of state towards other properties. Therefore, the PCP-SAFT equation of state fails to describe the critical point and also the critical exponents due to its mean-\feld nature. It is of interest to evaluate corrections to both of these data. We evaluate the impact of estimating parameters \ftting these data separately. First, we estimated the parameters using an objective function with only the data from the critical point, given by c\u0000Pcalc c Pexp c\u0000Tcalc c Texp c\u0000\u001acalc c \u001aexp The obtained parameters are summed in the Appendix, Table A.2 and are named here as Set 1. When analyzing these parameters, we can see a very low variability of the \u00110parameter, as highlighted in Figure 4.2.

None of the parameter sets had large errors. Two of them are considered here. Set 2 which has only two parameters, and Set 1 which presented the smallest errors. The estimation methods, for global and local searches were the Particle Swarm Optimization (KENNEDY; EBERHART, 1995) and the Nelder-Mead (ROWAN, 1990) algorithm. First, the global method was applied, and its results were an input to the local search algo- rithm. In this work, we use Set 1 of parameters, since we want to assess better the capabilities and limitations of the Gaussian Extrapolation approach applied to the PCP-SAFT equation of state.

Curiously enough, when estimating param- eters considering both \fand\u000e, the other critical exponents are not correct. This seems like an incorrect result, as the critical scaling laws state that only 2 critical exponents are independent. Therefore, correcting two of them is not enough to correct all the non-classical behavior.", "When calculating the isochoric heat capacity for the critical isochore in the vicin- ity of the critical point, it is clear that the equation of state behavior is still classical, not showing a maximum at the critical temperature, as shown in later sections of this work.", "When estimating parameters considering \u000band critical exponents inside the objective function, no minima was found capable of correcting these exponents. From the above results, it seems that the density dependency of the extrapolation is correct, as we can correct critical exponents easily when density is the order param- eters. However, as the \u000band critical exponents are more related to temperature derivatives, temperature dependency can be improved. In recent work, Vinhal et al. (VINHAL et al., 2020) compared the results of derivative properties of renormal- ization group theory and Kiselev's approach for derivative properties. The Kiselev approach is another methods that correct the classical behavior of equations of state in the vicinity of the critical point. The best approximation of the \u000bexponent was 0.074 using the renormalization group theory approach. Other works in the lit- erature have shown that the renormalization group theory can correct all critical exponents. Therefore, as the Gaussian extrapolation approach could not reproduce the same results, it may be interesting to look at the comparison of both methods, as the Gaussian extrapolation has some great advantages over the renormalization group theory, such as being an analytical method. uence of each parameter In order to understand how each parameter in uences each of the analyzed critical exponents, we used n-Butane, n-Dodecane, and n-Hexatriacontane as proxy sub- stances to change the G0,G1, and\u00110parameters separately while \fxing the two others at the estimated value \ftted to the critical point. The results of the variation of the four critical exponents are shown in here.

Only in the case of parameter G1for n-Dodecane and n-Hexatriacontane, the local minimum in the vicinity of the non-classical \fvalue was not seen. For higher molecular-weight substances, the G0value necessary to reach the non-classical \fcritical exponent is higher, implying that uctuations need to be higher in mag- nitude to reach a non-classical behavior. For the parameter \u00110, local minimum and local maximum are observed in values higher than the \fclassical value. This re- sult for\u00110is somewhat expected. This happens because the Gaussian Ginterferes directly on the isotherm loops inside the liquid-vapor phase envelope, diminishing them in order to lower the critical point. Therefore, as we move the center of the GaussianG, given by\u00110, away from the critical density, we start to create new loops on the isotherm outside the envelope, creating a new uid-phase critical point.", "Regarding the \u000bcritical exponent, none of the parameters were able to e\u000bectively reach any considerable value close to the non-classical behavior. The \u000ecritical exponent was approached smoothly by changing \u00110, but still, the non-classical value was not reached. The only case in which this parameter was calculated right at the non-classical value was when all parameters from the Gaussian extrapolation were allowed to change simultaneously, trying to calculate the critical exponents. There is a marked di\u000berence between varying G0andG1, in which there seems to be a discontinuity along the curves of the critical exponent \u000ewhen changing these parameters. The same discontinuity is observed for the other critical exponents. For the critical exponent, again, none of the parameters could e\u000bectively reach the non-classical value.", "4.4.3 Vapor-Liquid Phase Equilibrium", "In order to assess the qualitative and quantitative \ft of the method for pure sub- stances, we show results for vapor-liquid phase equilibrium envelopes of some sub- stances.", "Figure 4.9: Liquid-Vapor phase envelope for C1,C2, n-C4and n-C8. As shown in Figure 4.9, the Gaussian extrapolation method has a lot of sim- ilarities to the renormalization method regarding the results of pure liquid-vapor envelopes. First, the corrections are more important in the vicinity of the critical point, that is, when conditions stray farther away from the critical point, the correc- tions applied by the method diminishes, which is expected since, at these conditions, uctuations are not crucial to thermodynamic properties. We also highlight that, as equations of state also fail at low temperatures, it would be interesting to investigate further if the Gaussian extrapolation approach could correct their behavior at these conditions. Also, the fact that PCP-SAFT overestimates the critical point, because its parameters were estimated to \ft saturated liquid density data, which due the fact that as it is a mean-\feld theory and it has a critical exponent \f= 0:5. These results show that it is not necessary, up to this point, to consider using near-critical liquid-vapor equilibria data to estimate the Gaussian extrapolation parameters. To assess the in uence of each Gaussian extrapolation parameter into the pure liquid-vapor phase equilibrium, we evaluate how the phase envelope changes when these parameters are shifted, these results are shown in Figure 4.10. Figure 4.10: Liquid-Vapor Phase Envelope for n-Dodecane for di\u000berent G0,G1and \u00110parameter values using PCP-SAFT-2G. In each situation, one parameter varies, and the other two remain \fxed. The values of the parameters are presented in the appendix of this work.", "Figure 4.10 shows that, when the parameters G0andG1are shifted, the phase envelope near the critical point can become very sharp, which translates to values of\fsmaller than the non-classical value. This e\u000bect has already been shown in previous sections of this work in Figure 4.5. However, the shifting of parameter \u00110, besides changing the atness of the envelope, also shifts the critical density, making the liquid-vapor envelope more asymmetric. This is because changing the value of\u00110introduces uctuations to the isotherm that can create or eliminate new loops inside the phase envelope and e\u000bectively create new critical points or move the original liquid-vapor critical density.", "The Gaussian extrapolation approach had a good performance regarding liquid- vapor phase equilibrium of binary mixtures, as shown in Figure 4.11. Figure 4.11: C1- n-C4liquid-vapor phase envelope at 294.0 K. In Figure 4.11, the phase envelope, when the Gaussian extrapolation approach is applied, shows a tendency to retract, as it lowers the bubble point pressure in order to match the critical point of the mixture in the given temperature, as seen for the renormalization in the cases of CO 2+ n-Butane and H 2S + methanol mixtures. In order to see whether the critical lines of the mixtures are corrected, and thus, evaluating if the liquid-vapor phase equilibria would match the critical point of the mixtures predictively (all results were analyzed using kij), the critical lines of di\u000berent mixtures are analyzed. First, by seeing low-weight n-alkane mixtures, we evaluated mixtures of methane with ethane, propane, and n-butane The results are shown in Figures 4.12 to 4.14.", "Figure 4.12: C1(1) - n-Alkanes(2) critical lines Figure 4.13: C1(1) - n-Alkanes(2) pressures as a function of mole fraction. Figure 4.14: C1(1) - n-Alkanes(2) critical temperatures as a function of mole fraction. As seen in Figures 4.12 to 4.14, for all cases, using the Gaussian extrapolation approach improved the performance of the PCP-SAFT equation of state towards predicting critical lines, both for critical pressure and temperature. Also, for ethane with n-butane mixture, shown in Figures 4.15 to 4.18, the same conclusions can be drawn, and now also for the critical volume.", "Figure 4.15: C2(1) - n-C4(2) critical line Figure 4.16: C2(1) - n-C4(2) critical pressure as a function of mole fraction Figure 4.17: C2(1) - n-C4(2) critical temperature as a function of mole fraction. Figure 4.18: C2(1) - n-C4(2) critical volume as a function of mole fraction. We now introduce more asymmetric mixtures in terms of interactions, consider- ing mixture of CO 2(without quadrupole forces) with ethane. We have the following results for critical lines shown in Figures 4.19 to 4.21 Figure 4.19: CO 2(1) -C2(2) critical line Figure 4.20: CO 2(1) -C2(2) critical pressure as a function of mole fraction. Figure 4.21: CO 2(1) -C2(2) critical temperature as a function of mole fraction. TheCO 2molecule is better described when quadrupole forces are considered. Then, it is not surprising that the critical line for PCP-SAFT is quantitative (because it does not match the critical point for pure substances), and qualitatively di\u000berent than the experimental data, showing a wrong concavity. Introducing the Gaussian extrapolation correction does not lead to any changes in the qualitative behavior of the critical correction for the pure substances. When we add quadrupole forces to CO 2and reestimate the Gaussian extrapolation parameters, we have better results, as can be seen in Figures 4.22 to 4.24.", "Figure 4.22: CO 2(1) -C2(2) critical line, considering quadrupolar forces for CO 2. Figure 4.23: CO 2(1) -C2(2) critical pressure as a function of mole fraction, consid- ering quadrupolar forces for CO 2.", "Figure 4.24: CO 2(1) -C2(2) critical temperature as a function of mole fraction, considering quadrupolar forces for CO 2.", "Inputting quadrupolar forces was enough to correct the qualitative behavior of the critical line. However, the lack of adjustment was still signi\fcant, which was di- minished when we applied the Gaussian Extrapolation approach, again, not chang- ing the qualitative description of the line, but rather \fxing the pure components critical points, which leads to superior description of the experimental data. Now that we see that there is a reasonable adjustment for the critical line, we can observe what happens to the vapor-liquid behavior of the mixture, shown in Figures 4.25 Figure 4.25: CO 2(1) -C2(2) vapor-liquid phase equilibrium at 298.15K.

There is also a good adjustment to the phase equilibria at the CO 2-rich region. However, at 293.15K, as the experimental critical point of the mixture gears towards an equimolar composi- tion, where the PCP-SAFT-2G critical line has less adjustment to the experimental critical line. The correction has a greater lack of adjustment mainly in the carbon dioxide-rich region, leading to a wrong phase equilibrium envelope behavior, not in the experimental condition, as it did not cross the critical line. By analyzing the behavior of the PCP-SAFT and PCP-SAFT-2G equations of state near the critical point of the lighter substance in a binary mixture, we can evaluate if there is an expected correction related to the slope of the critical line. We analyzed the methane-ethane mixture. The results are shown in Figures 4.27 and 4.28. There is an interesting behavior to analyze in this condition, there is a discussion on whether the slope of pressure with respect to composition is zero in the near-critical region (at the critical isotherm of the lighter component, near its critical pressure). Our results show that the slope is not zero for both PCP-SAFT and PCP-SAFT-2G, as stated in the literature (RAINWATER, 2001; SENGERS, 1986). The experimental data in Figure 4.27 shows a zero slope at this condition. However, as supported by other authors in the literature (SENGERS, 1986), this should not be the case. Thus, the Gaussian extrapolation approach can better describe the experimental data and still exhibit the expected behavior of non-zero slope in the vicinity of the critical point. In Figure 4.28, at around 3K above the lighter component critical temperature, both the experimental data and the PCP- SAFT-2G equation of state show a very similar slope at the maximum pressure. While for the PCP-SAFT equation of state, a bird's beak behavior is still observed, which may be a direct result of the lack of adjustment of the critical pressure or the more classical behavior of the PC-SAFT compared to the PCP-SAFT-2G. Figure 4.27: Vapor-Liquid envelope for Methane+Ethane mixture at 190.94K. Ex- perimental Data (symbols), PCP-SAFT (green line), PCP-SAFT-2G (red line). The inset shows a zoom near the critical point, the dashed lines is a guide for the eye of the experimental data.", "Chapter 6 Conclusions and Suggestions Both the Renormalization Group Theory and the Gaussian Extrapolation are math- ematical methods with a physical background in their developments capable of cor- recting the classical behavior of equations of state in the vicinity of the critical point. However, these corrections are limited to the liquid-vapor phase equilibrium calculations, with di\u000eculties to correct the behavior regarding derivative properties. Regarding applying the methods, the Gaussian extrapolation approach is more accessible than the Renormalization Group Theory: First, the Gaussian extrapo- lation approach is an analytical method, while the Renormalization Group Theory is numerical; Second, while the Renormalization Group Theory requires the whole uid density range to calculate a thermodynamic property at a single NVT point, the Gaussian extrapolation approach otherwise can do single NVT point calculations without considering the whole density range, which makes it faster. Further works should focus on testing other mixing rules for the Gaussian ex- trapolation approach. Also, it would be interesting to reestimate the Gaussian extrapolation approach parameters in order to include saturation pressure, liquid and vapor saturation density, and derivative properties, such as residual isochoric heat capacity, speed of sound, or isothermal compressibility coe\u000ecient in the objec- tive function, to investigate if these properties can be represented better. Another possibility is to verify the temperature dependence of the Gaussian function extend- ing corrections to derivative properties, correcting the critical exponents related to it. Regarding the Renormalization Group Theory, it would be interesting to study analytical approaches and what modi\fcations are needed to represent derivative properties better.", "Bibliography ALY, F.

Appendix A Appendix - Gaussian Extrapolation Approach A.1 Gaussian Extrapolation Approach Deriva- tives First, as the derivatives for the second-order of the Barker Henderdon perturbation theory are already known, we will identify the new contribution to the equation of state as AGE NkT=A2 NkTAinf (A.1) We detail only those derivatives and expressions not present in the original PC- SAFT publication. Because we have split Gaussian Extrapolation contribution into AinfandA2contributions, we present only the derivatives of Ainfas the derivatives forA2are already present at the literature. Extending these equations to mixtures, we consider that the uctuations of a mixture is the average of uctuations of the pure substances, that is, there is no interaction between uctuations and therefore Ainf=2 G=NCX ixigi (A.3) Wheregiis the individual uctuation contribution from the i-th component of the mixture, represented by gi=mi\u000fiG0;i The derivatives of Equation (A.3) are the ones that change from one variable to the other, as Ainfderivatives are only dependent on G. Therefore, deriving Ainf with respect to a variable K, we have that @Ainf G\u0000 @2Ainf @3Ainf Looking into Equations (A.5) to (A.7), we can see that we only need to know thegiderivatives. With the relations presented below, it is possible to make phase equilibrium and derivative properties calculations.

As can be seen in Chapter 6, as compared to Chapter 6, no maximum was observed near the critical density at the critical temperature, as expected from the non-classical behavior, both PCP-SAFT and PCP-SAFT-2G showed similar behavior, the only di\u000berence being made probably by the shift in the critical point provided by the Gaussian Extrapolation. And since we are using the quadrupolar version of PCP-SAFT, the critical point of CO 2is not very far from the experimental point, making the di\u000berence between both models not large.

In order to perform phase equi- librium calculations with this curve, we need to apply cubic splines interpolations. It is advisable to use non-dimensional variables, which can be computed from its di- mensional versions using the following equations (variables marked with an asterisk are non-dimensional) T\u0003=RTb f\u0003=fb2 All derivatives can be approximated using the \fnite di\u000berence method, using \fve-point stencils for central di\u000berence. A simple algorithm to calculate the liquid and vapor saturation densities is devised as follows: (1) Using the equation of state, calculate the maximum liquid density ( \u001al;max) at a given temperature, with The 0.99999 instead of 1.00000 is used to avoid unwanted in\fnities. (2) From 0 to \u001al;max, set equally-spaced points of density (in this work we recom- mend using 500 points), and for each point, use the equation of state to calculate the Helmholtz free energy density (3) For each density point in the grid, apply Eqs. (10-21) for the desired number of iterations (in this work we recommend calculating 5 iterations). (4) With the renormalization Helmholtz free energy density grid, calculate the chemical potential and pressure curves using Equations B.5 and B.6 (5) Give liquid and vapor densities initial guesses and solve for the equilibrium conditions (equal pressure and chemical potential in both phases), calculating pres- sure and chemical potential using the cubic-splines interpolation. Pvap(\u001avap)\u0000Pliq(\u001aliq) = 0 (B.7) A simple newton-raphson algorithm should su\u000ece, given that the initial guesses are consistent and far away from the trivial solution (the root at the mechanically unstable region at the pressure isotherm). A good initial guess for the vapor density should be below the pressure of the isotherm minimum inside the coexistence curve, in the vapor region, in cases where the minimum pressure is negative, a value near zero should su\u000ece. The initial guess for the liquid density can be any density with a pressure higher than the isotherm maximum. However, to solve step (5), many di\u000berent algorithms can be used.", "B.2.5 Equations and Algorithm for Phase Equilibria Calcu- lations for Mixtures In this work, a very usual application of the isofugacity method was used. However, we do believe that to calculate the phase equilibria for binary or even multicom- ponent mixtures, very common algorithms [M, M] or more recent ones ' [S, G] can be used, since the calculation of thermodynamic properties and variables is very straigthforward using bicubic spline interpolations. It should be noted that the renormalization method, as it was applied, is speci\fed in temperature, thus, applications in which the temperature is not constant may be computationally cum- bersome.", "As an example, an algorithm to calculate Pxy envelopes for binary mixtures is as follows:", "(1) Upon specifying the temperature and molar fractions, use steps (1-3) from the procedure presented in appendix B.2.4 to obtain a renormalized Helmholtz free energy density curve (2) Iterate over the molar fractions from 0 to 1 to obtain a renormalized Helmholtz free energy density in function of adimensional density and molar frac- tions. The use of the adimensional density is what makes this step possible, since the density curve changes as the molar fractions changes. (3) Enter the envelope calculation algorithm, interpolating the renormalized Helmholtz free energy density surface with bicubic splines to calculate the fugacity for each component from the following equations: From the Helmholtz free energy density surface, a pressure surface can be calcu- lated since Therefore, From the pressure-surface, with speci\fed mole fraction, there is an isotherm in terms of pressure in function of density, from which, the densities of both phases can be calculated solving the equation:", "wherePis calculated using the cubic spline interpolation for a given density guess. The highest root of equation B.3 corresponds to the liquid phase density, while the lower is the vapor phase density, good initial guesses for density could follow the pure substance algorithm. With the densities of both phases, the residual chemical potential for the ith component in each phase can be calculated from \u0016res i=\u0012@fres T;xk 6=j;ncbi+ncX j=1\u0012@fres @xj\u0013 T;\u001ab;x k 6=j;nc\u0012\u000eij\u001ai\u0000\u001aj where the derivatives are calculated using the \fnite-di\u000berence method on the Helmholtz free energy density surface, using bicubic splines for interpolation. Fi- nally, to calculate fugacity, the following equation applies: ln\u001ei=\u0016res i RT\u0000ln\u0012P RT\u001a\u0013 With these equations, using the pressure and Helmholtz surfaces after applying the renormalization method, the fugacity coe\u000ecients can be readily calculated using bicubic spline interpolations and \fnite-di\u000berence derivatives."]}

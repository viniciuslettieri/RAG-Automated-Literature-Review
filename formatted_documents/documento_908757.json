It analyses the narratives from 18 confidential interviews with partners and officers of these entities. Activism is associated with confrontation and investors prefer collaborative relationships with companies , but large public pension funds use the term to describe their actions. Confrontation is avoided through prior scrutiny of companies’ governance and activism is reactive a defense mechanism, since investors do not believe it is effective when companies have cl early defined controlling shareholders. Collaboration on votes is becom ing more common but is neither frequent, regular or with the same parties. Pro- active activism is limited to and primarily associated with public pension funds proposing candidates to board seats, requesting separate elections for minority or preferred shareholders and fiscal boards. Voting disclosure is improving among non -independent asset managers and large public pension funds but s tewardship is incipient. Independent asset managers vote on a case -by-case basis. So, voting turnouts will remain low impacting the visibility and ability to measure investor activism. Investors, as an external governance mechanism, remain weak despite improvements in investor protection over the past 20 ye ars. Thus, if governance system effectiveness depends on the complementarity of internal and external mechanisms, improving investor protection without measures that effectively challeng e strong ownership concentration , seem to suggest that the overall governance system remains weak , and the principal -principal problem remain s without satisfactory remedies. This study is the first to take practitioners views into account, specifically that of non - independent and independent asset manage rs. It contributes to the literature on activism and corporate governance in emerging markets and informs discussions of other institutional environments where concentrated ownership dominates. It adds to the literature on activism , investor heterogeneity , comparative governance .", "Key words: Activism, Engagement, Ownership, Corporate Governance, Emerging Markets, Brazil", "TABLE OF CONTENTS", "3 THE BRAZILIAN INSTIT UTIONAL SETTING AND CONTEXT: CAPITAL MAR KETS AND", "8.4 ENGAGEMENT PROCESS – ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS (MEETINGS WITH THE COM PANY AND", "VOTING ) 151", "1 Introduction", "Institutional investors are important players in developed and emerging capital markets (Khorana, Servaes , and Tufano, 2005; Ferreira and Matos, 2008 ). Total net assets under management worldwide were US$ 48 trillion in the first quarter of 20 20. China, Brazil, and Korea host the largest investment management industries among emerging economies (IIFA, 20 20) This study explores attitudes towards activism , the corporate governance preferences, and more broadly, the engagement process of the Brazilian investment industry by interview ing partners and officers of three groups of Brazilian institutional investors: pension funds (PF), the investment units of financial institutions such as commercial and investment banks, non-independent asset managers (NIA) hereafter, and independent asset managers (IAs) , who are mutual stock fund managers and for whom investing in equities represents a substantial proportion of their business.", "While pension funds cater primarily to Brazilian employees of state -owned and private companies, financial institutions and asset managers have a broader client base: domestic and foreign pension funds, endowmen ts, high net worth individuals, and retail investors. To the extent that these investment institutions depend on equit ies for their overall performance, it might therefore be expected that they would be keenly interested in improving investee performance a nd possibly wish to influence firm governance and encourage shareholder engagement.", "The relevance of examining institutional investors’ perspectives and attitudes towards their engagement with investee companies is related to the exercise of their rights a nd obligations as owners and fiduciaries , but also, stewardship towards correcting company direction thereby contributing to the efficient allocation of resources . Investors are expected to make merit -based resource allocation and pressure poor performing managements to correct their course (Hoskisson et al., 2002) . Additionally, shareholder activism may be viewed as an external corporate governance mechanism that works towards the ful fillment of three corporate governance objectives: protection and enforceability of stakeholder rights, mediation of internal and external stakeholder relationships; and guidance on strategic and ethical matters (Aguilera , et al. , 2015) .", "We have left out three groups of important institutional investors in this stud y: hedge funds, private equity, and foreign investors. There are reasons for this. Hedge funds sharing the regulatory freedom that is possible in the United States, do not exist in Brazil because the current regulation requires all funds to be registered w ith the Brazilian Securities and Exchange Commission (Comissão de Valores Mobiliários – CVM), compute the price of the fund's shares daily and other requirements that US hedge funds do not have. Private equity funds generally invest in private companies an d are", "usually insiders. Foreign investors (usually from the US and UK) are probably key players in fostering improvement in emerging markets engagement and governance practices in emerging markets. Activist investors have been found to be influential to th e improvement of corporate governance in emerging markets when they come from countries with strong activist traditions (Kim, Sung and Wei, 2017). We know they own more than 40% of listed companies capital in Brazil and were responsible for the largest tra ding volume in the Brazilian stock exchange although their presence fluctuates depending on how Brazil is weighted in the emerging market indices (De La Cruz, Medina and Tang, 2019; B3 – Operating Report). We exclude them, however, because there is no sour ce of information that allows us to compare the size of their investments in Brazil relative to that of local entities, they are more difficult to access , and their behavior is widely explored in the US and UK literature. Activism in Latin America and Brazil is under -researched, unlike in the United States and Europe (Crisóstomo and González, 2006), and even a meta -analysis of articles on corporate governance and performance in Latin America failed to uncover papers on activism up to 2015 (Maranho and Leal, 2018 ). However, there is a growing but number of papers on the subject and Vargas, Bortolon, Barros and Leal (2018) report a growing presence of the topic in the specialized media ( Vargas et al. , 2018 ). Most studies have focused on the relations hip between activism and corporate governance, efficiency and performance (Vargas et al. , 2018; Guimarães et al ., 2019 ; Maranho, Leal and Bortolon, 2020 ; Collares, 2020) and on major institutional investors – Brazilian pension funds and on BNDESPar, the in vestment arm of the country’s national development bank (BNDES), ( Crisóstomo and González , 2006 ; Punsuvo and Kayo, 2007 ; De Oliveira, Leal and Almeida, 2012 ; Sonza and Granzotto, 2018 ; De Almeida and Leal, 2020; Lazzarini and Musachio, 2010 ; Duarte and Lea l, 202 1).", "In this research we ask w hat meanings partners and officer s of institutional investors attribute to the term s, “activism” and “engagement”? Which corporate governance practices investors value most and why and, as a result, would : a) serve as criteria for investment decisions; b) be a matter for regular engagement, and c) prompt them into action.", "This paper adds to the literature by highli ghting practi tioner narratives on the topic . It innovates by considering the views of independent and non -independent asset managers , a group of growing significance, but who is usually dwarfed by the importance of pension funds. To conduct this research , we adopted two criteria. The most important was size because larger funds are more lik ely to engage in activism (Ryan and Schneider, 2002, Admati and Pfleider, 1994 ; La Porta et al. , 1999) . The second was size of their stock assets under management .", "Individuals of e ighteen entities offered their views under confidentiality agreements. T hey include some of the largest institutions in the country in each category.", "Our first conclusion is that both IAs and NIAs do not consider them selves activists because the term has a negative conno tation. IAs, think it distorts focus , it is not up to them to tell management what to do and they are not paid to spend their scare resources on something that is ineffective because most Brazilian companies have controlling shareholders. They focus on collaboration and want to be close to their investees with wh om they take great care building relationships. However, if they disagree with the direction a company is taking , they will first attempt to talk but if that fails, the preferred route is exit. Scaling up the fi ght will happen if they need to defend their rights in a position that is large in their portfolios. Voting practice varies but most consider it on a case-by-case basis and for reasons other than fiduciary duty.", "NIAs also want to put their engagement efforts in a positive light and focus on ESG whe re they participate on their own of in PRI organized groups . As signatories of PRI principles , they are concerned with ESG risks and have similar approaches as to how they incorporate ESG in the valuation of their investees. Engagement is less personal and institutionalized , and they seek information they want the companies to disclose on official documents . Exit for them is more difficult because they need liquidity in an already small market . They have committed to Stewardship , so they are becoming more assiduous in their voting practice and disclose their vote direction for every company.", "Pension funds are a more diverse group. All are early PRI signatories and have long been incorporating ESG issues in their practice. But the y differ in activist practice depending on how they manage their funds. Some have outsourced the equity exposure entirely . Their role, in fact the role of pension funds towards the outsourced portions of their portfolios, is inducing asset managers who serve them to increase formality, accountability and ESG responsibility . Whe n they are insiders – part of a shareholders ’ agreement or in a private equity fund – they have great le eway to implement their ideas and objectives. It is in internally manag ed portfolio where they may take an activist role. Even so, some pension funds are in the process of but not yet structured to vote their shares . Some very large pension funds have always been very active – they describe their actions as activism - and for companies they have enough votes to elect board members they will propose a candidate through whom they will try to persuade to influence the company in what they have in their agenda. When they do not have enough votes , they may also try to influence oth er investors to support their candidates. In fact , all investor s recognize that co llaborating to elect board candidates (either board", "of directors or fiscal boards) is becoming for frequent and may be a measure of where Brazilian institutional investors are becoming more active and where minority shareholder may even dispute for candidates. Some pension funds will make their voting direction public.", "Excepting a few pension funds that manag e investments internally , investor discourses suggest the concept of ownership that best matches their attitudes is one of legal owners who view their obligations with the investee firm in terms of a set of rights and obligations, as “active owners” in McNulty and Nordberg’s (2016) path a . As such they do not necessarily see that it is their responsibilit y to pressure managements of poor performing companies to improve. However, according to Hoskisson, Hitt, Johnson and Grossman, (2002 ) this is considered one of the critical functions expected of institutional investors. The other is allocation resources based on the merits of individual investments. However, since most companies in Brazil ha ve a controlling shareholder , that is not the ir responsibility either. So institutional investors in Brazil, are a weak external governance mechanism.", "True enough in their private conversations IAs may influence companies. In the same manner , all ESG engagement efforts may also be effective. But because these happen in private spheres , and lack observable indicators , it will be difficult to as certain effectiveness. Furthermore , voting is not obligatory in Brazil , so voting turnouts will not be as large as in the United States w here it is mandatory . To the extent the voting direction is important for the measurement of activism, we can expect manifestations to remain low.", "The perspectives are consistent with predictions and findings in the literature namely, that ownership concentration subdues activism (Schleifer and Vishny, 1997; La Porta,1999) and that diversificat ion and performance metrics (Gilson and Gordon, 2013), profit -seeking and short -term liability structure s are prone to less activism ( Çelik and Ikabosson, 2013; Ryan and Schneider, 2002). They corroborate with the view that investor size enables investors to wage activism (Ryan and Schneider, 2002; Rubach and Sebora,2009) and that, mutual funds, are the least active of Brazilian investors (Maranho et al. , 2020). They also support the view that activism in Brazil is still low but increasing (Vargas et al. , 2017). However, investor perspectives permit us to see how those that are making decisions make sense of their world, understand their limitations, expose their frustrations, and describe their actions.", "This document is organized as follows: Chapter 2 sets the theoretical framework and the literature review that organizes the base for the analysis. Chapter 3 describes the Brazilian context. Chapter 4, the methodology.

A final discussion can be found in chapter 8 and the conclusion in chapter 9.", "2 Theoretical Framework and Literature Review", "The objective of this research is to gain insight into investor attitudes and values towards engagement and activism as well as on their corporate governance preferences. Such prefer ences are those related corporate governance practices and the processes through which investors may act. This enquiry is focused on “financial activism” as opposed to “ESG activism” (Goronova and Ryan, 2014).", "2.1 Shareholder Value", "The theoretical starting p oint of this study is the shareholder value approach to corporate governance . “Shareholder value” prioritizes the owners of the property of a firm over that of other stakeholders on the argument they are the providers of capital: they finance the corporati on, bear the investment risk , and are entitled to the political and economic rights of ownership however disperse and passive they might be . The importance of this perspective for this study is that it legitimized the ongoing relationship between owners of stock and managers of investee companies and brought this relationship – i.e., shareholder engagement - to the forefront of discussions (Martin, Casson and Nisar, The view that companies should be managed primarily in the interests of its sha reholder is rooted in the belief that competitive markets are more efficient and fairer than politics and administration in distributing economic rewards (Dore, 2000) . Shareholder value influenced much finance theory development, e.g. , the efficient capita l market hypothesis (a market in which security prices fully reflect available information) and much of the corporate practice since the 1980s (Martin", "2.2 Institutional Theory", "Additionally, this study borrows concepts from institutional theory’s economic and sociological perspectives. According to Richter, the term “New Institutional Economics (NIE)” is associated with academics who theorized about property rights, transaction costs economics, agency theory, analysis of the law, collectiv e action, public choice theory, the theory of relational contracts, and comparative economic systems. These theorists, although preserving neoclassical foundations of “methodological individualism and individual rational choice given a set of constraints”, believe “institutions ” make a difference and influence outcomes. The institutional framework, instead of given, is an object of research and believed to impact economic behavior (Richter, 2005). In NIE,", "institutions are the “formal rules, the informal nor ms and their enforcement characteristics ” which define the “ way the game is played ”, while “organizations”, in turn, “ are the players ” (North, 2008) . Thus, when investigating institutional investor behavior and engagement process, consideration needs to be made to the institutional environment in which these organizations – institutional investors and investees - companies are embedded.", "Table 2-1 Institutional Theory # Theoretical Proposition Sources 1 The institutional environment in which organizations are embedded, matter. Ricther, R. (2005); North, D. C. 2 Institutional investors are organizations that seek legitimacy. To comply and be perceived as legitimate, they will adopt structures and procedures that make them alike other or ganizations in the same field. Dimaggio & Powell (1983)", "Note, however, that broadly defined, NIE accommodates different strands that vary in how they depart from neoclassical economics. The differences appear in the concept s of uncertainty (types of uncertainty), rationality (maximization/bounded rationality/creativity), and the influence of institutions on the econom y (restrictive/cognitive functions). In certain strands, “ the separation between NIE and neoclassical economics is not clear -cut, namely agency theory, economic analysis of the law, and public choice theory ”, because these theories maintain the neoclassical notion of utility maximization. Alternatively, b ounded rationality is assumed in transaction cost analysis, property rights theory , and “in the new institutional approach to new economic history ” (Dequech, 2006, pg . Dimaggio and Powell (1983) are proponents of the sociological perspective of institutional theory (Richter, 2005). They note that organizations are alike an d argue that powerful forces come into play when organizations are structured into a field. Organizations are subjected to a process of isomorphism – constraints “that force one unit of the population to resemble other units that face the same set of envir onmental conditions”. Organizations face 1) coercive isomorphism arising from political influence and legitimacy needs; 2) mimetic isomorphism due to standard responses to uncertainty and 3) normative isomorphism resulting from professionalization. They fu rther argue that while homogeneity may facilitate transactions, attract appropriate personnel, help recognition as legitimate and reputable, and enable organizations to become eligible for public and private grants or contracts, adopting similar structures does not necessarily make them more efficient or better than deviant peers (Dimaggio, and Powell, 1983 pgs. 149, 153 -154). What is relevant in their theory for", "our purposes in this study, is that institutional investors, as organizations belonging to a f ield, will adopt similar structures and procedures due to isomorphism.", "Note that Hambrick, Finkelstein, Cho , and Jackson (2005), argue and illustrate that in the period between 1980 and 2000 companies in the US within the same industry became more heterogeneous. They consider that the forces that act towards homogeneity proposed by Dimaggio and Powell (1983) are correct but argue that the macro -social trends leading to isomorphism moved in the opposite direction resulting in enhanced intra -sectorial di versity.", "This study views the voluntary act of adhering to widely accepted codes of principles or best practices issued by reputable local or international entities such as the Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI)1 as inducers of isomorphism. Usuall y, signatories of the principles and codes are required to go beyond a formal commitment and adopt standard procedures and reports. S uch propensity for standardization is illustrated by a quote from the investment director of Petros, one of Brazil’s larges t pension funds, at the time of his appointment to the executive board of the Associação dos Investidores no Mercado de Capitais (AMEC)2. Petros is a signatory of AMEC’s Stewardship Code :", "“We are using AMEC’s Stewardship Code as our main reference on engagement issues and environmental, social and governance (ESG) principles. The document is very clear with respect to criteria for engagement with companies regarding social and environmental themes...” Investidor Institucional 28/9/2020” (free translation)3.", "2.3 Agency Theory", "“Agency theory provides the underlying theoretical rationale for shareholder value corporate governance ” (Martin et al. , 2007, pg .6). Agency problems between owners and man agers arise when the former ( principals ) delegate decision making power over their property to managers ( agents ) who have different interest s and risk profiles. In distancing themselves from day -to-day management, owners have less information about the bus iness subjecting themselves to a situation of information asymmetry. They will have to draw up a contract establishing manager prerogatives and", "1PRI - https://www.unpri.org/", "2 AMEC acts in the defense of the interests of minority shareholders in Brazil 3 “O diretor de investimentos da Petros, Alexandre Mathias, passa a integrar a diretoria executiva da Associação dos Investidores no Mercado de Capitais (Amec), entidade que atua em defesa dos acionistas minoritários. A Petros é signatária do Código Stewardship da Amec. O código, segundo Mathias, é um importante guia para questões de engajamento e de práticas ambientais, sociais e de governança (ESG): “Estamos tomando o Código Stewardship da Amec como nossa principal referência nas questões de engajamento e nos princípios ESG. O documento é bem claro no que diz respeito aos critérios de engajamento das empresas em temas socioambientais”... Investidor Institucional", "responsibilities which, nevertheless, will never be able to cover all possible decision -making situations and wi ll leave room for managers to exercise judgment (imperfect contracts). Therefore, ensuring agents make decisions in the best interest of principals requires the implementation of control and information systems, and standards to enable monitoring. There ar e costs and limits for what monitoring can achieve.", "Thus, this (positivist ) line of inquiry of agency theory focuses on the contract between owners of the corporation and managers , rather than on the broader phenomenon of agency problems (employer -employees, lawyer -client, buyer -supplier, etc.). It aims to identify the most efficient contract governing the relationship between principal and agent given several behavioral assumptions (Eisenhardt,198 9).", "It does so because agency theory views the firm as a set of contracts. “The private corporation or firm is simply one form of legal fiction which serves as a nexus for contracting relationships , and which is also characterized by the existence of div isible residual claims on the assets and cash flows of the organization which can generally be sold without permission of the other contracting individuals” (Jensen and Meckling , 1976, p g.311).", "Regarding behavioral assumptions , Jensen and Meckling (1976) describe both parties as rational - deliberate utility maximizers . As such, agents will not always act in the best interests of principals who will remedy this risk by making use of mechanisms such as 1) incentives for agents to align interests (e.g. compe nsation); 2) monitor costs to put a check on agent misbehavior (e.g. accounting practices, control systems, budget restrictions, and a professional board of directors whose members operate in the stockholders’ interest) and 3) incentivize the agent to spen d resources to ensure he will not take actions that harm the principal and to compensate the latter if they do so (bonding costs). However, since it is not possible to ensure that, at zero cost, agent decisions will always be optimal for principals, there will always be a residual loss. Ultimately, what these authors refer to as agency costs is the sum of monitoring and bonding costs , and residual loss, all of which will be entirely borne by the principals.", "This perspective of agency theory recogni zes an in herent conflict -of-interest between shareholders and managers (Davis and Thompson, 1994) . However, it does not problematize owner/shareholder behavior and does not predict expected behavior. The theoretical proposition it makes regarding owner behavior ari ses from its core assumption: owners are rational, self -seeking utility maximizers , a party to the nexus of contracts comprised by the firm . This conception contrasts", "with that of the legal view (discussed below) where owners are entitled to legal and mora l rights (and obligations) of ownership ( Hendry et al. , 2006 ).", "In their seminal work, Berle and Means (19 91) note the dispersion of ownership and the corresponding loss of power over the property owned. Instead of “physical assets”, ownership of the company is held in the form of “rights and expectations” (Berle & Means, 1991, pg . 64) over the company. They argue o wners have no control over the physical assets that generate their wealth and have, thus, become “passive”. As a result, owners hav e less incentive to exercise ownership rights making it easier for managers to increase influence. Berle and Means propose that owners have three interests : a) “to earn the maximum profit compatible with a reasonable degree of risk ”, b) to receive a genero us and equitable share of the profits, and (c) to market his stock freely at a fair price” (Berle and Means, 1932, p g. 114-122). So, ownership dispersion leads to a portfolio management perspective towards ownership. Note, however, that i n their introduct ory comments to the 3rd edition of the Modern Corporation and Private Property, Weidenbaum and Jensen remark the authors may have exaggerated on the extent common stockholders might have lost control of their assets (Berle and Means, 1991, pg . xi).", "2.4 Corporate Governance", "Under th e shareholder value approach, the main goal of “corporate governance” is to ensure executives will manage the company well and in the interest of shareholders. Thus, corporate governance deals with the relationships among thos e at the top of the company: the shareholders, the board of directors , and the executive board, and, specifically , the distribution of authority between the board and the CEO (Roe , 2008 , pg. 371). In its core, corporate governance is intended to handle the agency problems associated with the separation of management and shareholders (Martin et al. , 2007). And thus, c orporate governance mechanisms are the legal and economic institutions that deal with the way the owners, as suppliers of capital, assure them selves they will get a return on their investment (Shleifer and Vishny, 1997) .", "These institutions enable shareholders to address the risk of managerial self -serving and shirking (principal -agent conflict), problems that could be amplified by the possibilit y of free -riding behavior on the part of distant and dispersed shareholders. One such mechanism is ownership concentration. Both the magnitude and the nature of agency problems are related to the configuration of the company’s ownership ( Gillan and Stark, 2003 ). When ownership is highly dispersed no one, shareholder will bear the cost of monitoring management to the benefit of all. In turn, large holders", "could have the incentive for more effective monitoring and countries where ownership structures are characterized by concentration of few large holders may have less agency issues related to the separation of management and control. And yet, ownership concentration may lead to another dimension of governance problems: that between dominant and minority share holders (or principal - principal conflict). In this situation, the risk is that large shareholders expropriate the smaller ones (Dharwadkar and George, 2000 ; La Porta et al. , 1999) . Thus, when private benefits of control exceed those of cashflow rights entitled by equity ownership , there will be an incentive to enhance control rights . This is typically achieved via dual-class shares , pyramid structures and cross holdings which are common around the wor ld where concentrated ownership prevails ( Deni s and M cConnell, 2003) . Beyond the shareholder value/agency theory models, corporate governance tackles a wider scope of issues such as the company’s need for legitimacy (Roe, 2005); the protection and enforcement of stakeholder rights; the mediation between the different stakeholders’ interests and demands; the assurance of appropriate disclosure and transparency standards; and the provision of strategic and ethical guidance for the firm ( Aguilera et al. , 2015). Irrespective of the scope of issues (narrow or wide) included in what is expected from corporate governance, the mechanisms (institutions) by which governance is exercised are essentially the same.", "2.4.1 Corporate Governance Mechanisms", "Internal governance mechanisms are those that emerge from within the firm and, when effective, aim to align managerial interests with that of shareholders and improve financial performance (the board of directors, managerial incentives, and ownership conce ntration). Internal mechanisms interact with phenomena which is external to the firm. External mechanisms include competitive markets, particularly the market for corporate control, the legal, political , and regulatory systems (including independent auditi ng requirements, bankruptcy laws, and disclosure requirements) (Jensen, 1993). Other authors emphasize the gate -keeping role of external players such as lawyers, accountants, and underwriters because they help outside shareholders interpret and trust the information provided to price securities, to make decisions on corporate control transactions to take legal action and understand related party transactions (Roe, 2005) , and the role of entities whose relevance has grown in the past 3 decades such as rati ng agencies (including proxy advisors, and security analysts), the media and institutional investor activism (Aguilera, 2015). The major cultural precondition for efficient markets is contractual trust – the expectation parties will honor the “written com mitments, underwritten by third parties and the legal system”", "(Martin et al. , 2007). Personal trust may be important but is based on private rather that transparent and equal -to-all information that is needed for efficient capital markets.", "2.4.1.1 Internal Gove rnance Mechanisms", "The board of directors is the main body of internal governance and is particularly important in companies with disperse ownership where shareholder interests need to be well represented and protected. The board is elected by the sharehol ders are accountable to them. They have fiduciary duties of care and loyalty4. The board makes key strategic and business decisions, hires/fires the chief executive officer (CEO) and monitors senior executives. In some broader concepts of corporate governa nce, the board is seen as guardians of corporate, principles and values, the charter and governance system.", "Board effectiveness is the desirable outcome and best practices codes make recommendations as to member qualification, nomination and evaluation pr ocesses and autonomous thinking and action. Board independence is the observable proxy for autonomy and has received more attention from the literature . Managerial incentives – usually executive compensation and contingent pay - are intended to align the i nterests of top executives with that of shareholders. Empirical evidence around the world seem to support the view that smaller boards are associated with better performance while outside directors are not. However, outside directors have had a positive impact of important matters such as acquisitions , executive compensation , and CEO turnover (Denis and McConnell, Ownership concentration is another key internal governance mechanism under the argument that larger participation will not only provide incentives but also power to monitor and advise managers and the board. However, empirical evidence that this is true is lacking (Dalton et al. , 2003 ). In addition, ownership concentration is associated with the legal system, specifically whether the count ry adopts common or civil law and the level of investor protection (see 2.4.13 below). Internal corporate governance mechanisms have varying degrees of effectiveness in ensuring that the firm will always be managed in the best interest of the shareholder. For example, the board of directors may not always be effective because of information a symmetry between them and the CEO who has great power to control the information provided to the board . Legal risks may bias board members to walk well-treaded paths instead of seeking profit maximization and, board interests", "4 Brazil’s Corporate Law, Law 6,404/76 Chapter XII, Section IV lays out Director duties and responsib ilities. In addition to the duty of care and loyalty, directors have the duty to inform to the market (Art.157): (i) how much shares of the company they own and have traded and (ii) any material changes in the company’s affairs.", "might not be aligned with that of shareholders. Additionally, if the CEO is also Chairman of the Board, he can curtail its independence. Therefore, there are several reasons why internal governance mechanisms might not be sufficient for good governance. E xternal corporate governance me chanisms are equally important either to complement or even replace internal mechanisms and allow for the achievement of optimal decisions (Roe, 2005, pg . 387).", "2.4.1.2 Competitive markets for products and services, managerial labor , and corporate control Competi tive markets for products and high -level executives are important external corporate governance mechanisms. Competition provides the opportunity for recuperation when inefficiencies arise (Hirshman, 1970). When customers may change supplier or find substit utes for the product or service, and executives can be easily replaced, at low cost, the conditions for “exit” are fulfilled and that route will send a clear message to the firm. But exit is not always possible because markets are imperfect. Monopolies, ol igopolies, and product differentiation may make replacement impossible or too costly. Furthermore, markets may deal with gross imperfections but will be less effective for some governance tasks. For example, an effective board may help the company make a s peedier adaptation to market changes and curb actions by mangers before they cause harm (Roe, 2008). Furthermore, while product and factor markets may discipline companies, they are slow to respond , and the reaction may come too late to save the company fr om failure avoiding the waste of resources. The market for corporate control , on the other hand, would be an efficient and speedier way to promote correction of deviant companies. Thus, Jensen (1993) argues that the existence of a market for corporate cont rol is necessary condition for capital markets to perform the role of efficient capital allocation (Jensen, 1993). Underperformance by publicly traded companies exposes them to the threat of a takeover which would provide an incentive for its management to improve performance so to prevent replacement or, if not, the execution of a takeover or other market for corpora te control activity such as mergers, buyouts, divestitures, would displace them.", "The discussion as to how effective the market for corporate control is as an ex -post corporate governance mechanism is relevant under the assumption that capital markets may p ressure underperforming companies who may be taken over. However, these conditions might not be widespread in countries where the ownership structure is characterized by over -50%-of-voting - capital control stakes. Furthermore, capital markets funding may co mpete with other sources of financing such as government and bank lending.", "2.4.1.3 The legal system", "The legal system impacts all dimensions of corporate governance and its mechanisms. The law normally defines the types of legal entities that are possible, requi res a statement of the company’s purpose, establishes the rights and responsibilities of firm owners and management (including the types of shares and their corresponding rights), the decision -making process of how the firm’s wealth is to be distributed an d disclosure requirements. The legal system includes the structures (e.g. , regulatory bodies) and processes put in place to enforce formal laws but also to principles and norms of voluntary adoption. (Aguilera et al. , 201 5). The latter include codes of go vernance, environmental social and governance (ESG), ethics and stewardship, standard reporting and engagement practices put forward by interest groups, professional organizations, standard setters, international coalition and networks, and market entities .", "Since corporate governance systems vary considerably around the world and capital markets may or may not have much relevance in corporate financing, scholars have devoted efforts to provide explanations for such differences and their consequences. One ma instream view relates to the quality of the corporate law. In their seminal work of the late 90s and early 2000, La Porta, Lopez -de-Silanes, Shleifer and Vishny (LLSV), examined company and bankruptcy laws in several countries focusing on investor and cred itor rights. Their goal was to identify the differences across countries and infer their implications to corporate finance. They assume investor protection contributes to external financing of firms and in consequence to economic efficiency.", "Shareholder ri ghts include “the right to receive dividends on pro -rata terms, to vote for directors, to participate in shareholders' meetings, to subscribe to new issues of securities on the same terms as the insiders, to sue directors or the majority for suspected expr opriation, to call extraordinary shareholders' meetings, etc .” (La Porta, 2000) . They conclude that countries with common law traditions offer more protection to shareholders than those with civil law. Among countries with civil laws, those following the F rench Civil law tradition such as in Latin America, afford the least protection to shareholders. They argue that the fact that the corporate law in these countries requires mandatory dividends is a remedy for providing few other protections to shareholders (La Porta, et al. , They also examine the quality of law enforcement by looking at the efficiency of the judicial system, rule of law, corruption, risk of expropriation based on data from credit agencies and the quality of the accounting standards. While Scandinavian Civil Law tops the list in terms of enforcement and accounting standards, French Civil Law continues at the bottom. Their last", "conclusion is that the quality of shareholder protection (voting rights/process) is associated with ownership concentration, i.e., more shareholder protection, more dispersion. Their empirical verification supports the view that ownership dispersion is more widespread in countries where the legal system better protects shareholders (La Porta et al. , 1999 ). However , they recognize that even in countries where capital dispersion is widespread, ownership concentration in large companies may be of more concern (Schleifer and Vishny, 1997).", "La Porta et al. (2000) predict that investor protection encourages the developm ent of financial markets and countries that enforce these laws have stronger and more valuable capital markets. They concur with the view that developed financial markets accelerate economic growth by enhancing and channeling savings to real investments, a nd improving resource allocation (La Porta et al. , 2000, pg .15). Thus, they argue in favor of extensive legal, regulatory, and judicial reform towards the adoption and enforcement of investor and creditor protection measures.", "A country’s law and enforceme nt should protect shareholder rights to have an efficient capital market (Martin et al. , 2007; Black , 2001 ). But law quality requires that an extensive list of legal capabilities be in place to ensure quality information and protect against owner self -dealing. This non -exhaustive list includes: 1) a securities regulator and a judiciary that are honest, competent, adequately staffed to handle complexity, to inter vene and avoid expropriation, and to produce decisions in a timely fashion. 2) regulation that requires disclosure of related party transactions in detail, conflict of interest policies and practices, and trading activity by insiders. 3) a securities law that imposes liabilities on accountants, investment bankers if they bring to market securities with false or misleading information and on companies and insiders if they do the same or if they approve self - dealing transactions; and civil and criminal liabil ity for insiders who violate self -dealing rules and intentionally mislead. 4) a stock exchange with relevant listing requirements, the will to and the power to enforce them (Black, 2001) . Voluntary governance norms and best practices standards proposed by market players such as stock exchanges or other groups in society may also influence corporate governance quality (e.g., the comply or explain codes of governance, codes of ethics, sustainability reporting, etc.) (Aguilera et al. , 2015).", "Another perspectiv e to law quality considers politics as determinant to corporate governance arrangements in different parts of the world. According to Gourevitch (2003) and Aminadav & Papaionannou (2020), Roe and Rajan -Zingales are major proponent of the strength of politi cs in shaping countries’ corporate governance (Gourevitch, 2003; Rajan and Zingales, 2003). Roe’s rationale is that corporate governance mechanisms within the firm interact with politics. He argues", "that the quality of the legal system alone is not enough t o determine why different governance systems coexist. The role played by competition in product and capital markets are also key ingredients of the governance system. When competition is strong there is less opportunity for monopoly rents. In turn, rents a re disputed not only by firms, but also within the firm by insiders: shareholders, managers, and employees. Lack of competition, thus, implies higher agency costs (in the broader agency theory perspective) and will provide incentives for the maintenance of direct control to ensure entitlement to those rents.", "However, to Roe, politics determines the level of competition in markets, and ultimately, corporate governance. To him, the key distinguishing political variable related to governance structure is socia l democracy. The proposition is that strong social democracies are associated with weaker shareholder rights which favors ownership concentration. The argument is that where labor rights are strong, ownership remains concentrated and, in fact, empirical ve rification presents a correlation between strong labor protection/low dispersion versus weak labor protection/high dispersion (Roe, 2008).", "Rajan and Zingales (2003) also consider competition to be a key element for development and propose an interest gr oup theory of financial development. They argue incumbents influence politics to deter financial development because the latter helps competition (Rajan and Zingales, A recent study by Aminadav & Papaionannou (2020 ) uses a large sample of firms a round the world and finds that both legal origin theories of corporate control , e.g., La Porta et al. (1998) and political theories of corporate control (Roe , 2008; Rajan and Zingales , 2003) are supported . They find ownership concentration/dispersion to be systematically associated with the country’s legal origin and quality of shareholder protection . They also find labor market protection (e.g. , restrictions in overtime and firings) ha ve strong correlation with corporate control and suggest “that linkages between finance and labor markets likely reflect the political equilibrium ” (Aminadav and Papaionannou , 2020 , pg.5).", "More important than the academic debate, the quality of law approach has influenced international development initiatives by the World Bank and has induced leading emerging markets and Europe to adopt “market dominated systems for organizing economic life” (Aguilera and Williams, 2009 , pg. 1424). This policy -making influence of the law quality perspective is relevant for the Brazilian context because the country has been, over the past 20 years, adopting rules and practices for better investor protection.", "Other ins titutional preconditions for capital market efficiency include the availability o f enough information on the corporation for investors to comfortably price the instrument (stock), i.e., evaluate company’s performance ; understand and evaluate related party transactions ; and know the company’s ownership structure (types of shares, rights and large shareholders). Information must be accurate, timely, and credible. Towards that end , there should be quality disclosure, particularly with respect to accounting standards, and trading prices (Martin et al. , 200 7).", "In addition to content, e ffective communication with investors involves accessible channels , such as company websites where all information provided by the company can be obtained at low cost; routinized communication events and procedures, such as earning releases and conference calls, participation in investor conferences; dedicated professionals to attend to investor needs; and access to management and the board. Such activities, which can be broadly referred to as “Investor Relations”, go well beyond what is legally required of public companies.", "2.4.1.4 Activism and Engagement", "Activism is viewed as an external corporate governance mechanism (Aguilera, 2015; Roe, 2008; Gillan and Starks, 2003). The literature uses the term “activism” as an all -encompassing word for outsider action towards companies as “ external pressure (…) to influence company policy and practices ” (Aguilera, 2015 , pg.534). As such, it includes efforts by not only shareholders but stakeholders in general, as well as opposing attitudes such as confrontation and coll aboration. The term “activism” carries no negative or positive connotation. For practitioners, however, the term might not be as neutral.", "The definition of “activism” varies. For example, “ shareholder activism ” as “actions taken by shareholders with th e explicit intention of influencing corporations’ policies and practices,” clearly excludes activism by other stakeholders as well as “latent intentions implicit in ownership stakes or trading behavior ” (Goronova and Ryan, 2014, pg.1232) . “Activism” can be defined as a process refer ring “not only to shareholder ‘voice ’ interventions but also to exit and loyalty ” (Sikavica, and Hillman, 2008, pg .1), - using Hirshman’s (1970) terminology. Alternatively, “activism” may also be viewed as a “decision process consisting of a sequential set of tactics” (Gantchev, 2013) which escalate in terms of belligerence and cost. In addition, “activism”, can be considered as special typ e of behavior under the broader practice of “investor engagement”. The latter term is frequently used interchangeably with activism but can be regarded as a broader concept which includes a wide range of activities: from basic information gathering to acti ve intervention in the company’s strategy and policy development by investors. Martin et al. (2007) considers “engagement” as “the use of residual", "control rights to influence the management process of a given portfolio company (Martin et al. 2007, pg. 19). In this study we take the view that activism is a specific behavior within the wider spectrum of the engagement process, the latter including the wide range of activities mentioned above. In their thorough review of the literature on activism, Goronva and Ryan (2014) , portray an evolving landscape since the 1970s. Their review includes activist proponents and issues , and theoretical underpinnings – where agency theory predominates; its targets ; empirical findings ; processes and outcomes. They distinguish b etween two streams of activism: “Financial activism” which target s compan y’s governance and performance , and “social activism” which seeks to affect social, political , and environmental matters. The former is legitimated by shareholder primacy and is theor etically grounded on agency theory while the latter is associated with stakeholder concerns and theory. The authors also organized the literature in three main categories: a) antecedents, relating to the issues that motivate activism such as firm performance or investor objectives; b) processes, referring to the means by which activism is realized, including managerial responses to activist pressure, the mechanisms used by investors to voice their demands and the types of demands that are made, and finally c) the outcomes of actions to the firm and for the investor and the environment (Goranova and Ryan, 2014 ).", "Financial activism seeks better performance, but it can be reactive as when its demands are for better governance practices or shareholder rights or pro -active when it targets specific managerial actions seeking short term returns to shareholders. The l atter is typical of more recent hedge fund activism (Goronova and Ryan, 2014). In this study we focus on financial activism, activist level motivation and the processes through which financial activism might be exercised.", "We note that since the 2019 Davos World Forum, the term “stakeholder capitalism” seems to have become the standard vocabulary associated with the idea that “capitalism” needs to solve “the world urgent challenges”5. Blackrock’s Larry Finks February 2020 Letter to CEOs – A Sense of Purpose -, sent a strong message to the market that ESG was an integral part of the investment criteria. Whether these movements, and the popular term “stakeholder capitalism” means that “agency theory” has been replaced by “stakeholder theory” or simply that inve stors have understood ESG to be integral to the company’s financial performance, is beyond the scope of this work.", "Despite the fact there is considerable research on the activism, insights on activism remain equivocal (Gillan and Starks, 2007 ; Agui lera, 201 5), possibly because of co nsiderable heterogeneity", "5“The World Economic Forum's 50th Annual Meeting in Davos will focus on how stakeholder capitalism can solve the world's urgent challenges.” https://www.weforum.org/focus/davos -2020 -collection", "among activists who pursue diverse objectives and expect different outcome s (Goranova and Ryan, 2014 ). One source of heterogeneity is associated with ownership, a core governance construct , given that market mechanisms may fail to bring about timely corrections to company performance (Jensen, 1993). Concentration of ownership is thought of to bring about the necessary incentive for investors to act. But ownership conceptions differ in what is the e xpected behavior of owners.", "2.5 Ownership", "Singling shareholders a s the primary recipient of a company’s economic benefits highlights the rights and obligations associated with ownership. Monks and Minow state that “the central tenet of the Western concept of ownership is that, to the extent that individuals own property, they will have the incentive to manage that property in a manner that is compatible with the interests of society as a whole”. Thus, (… ) “the best way for a nation to achieve prosperity is to create a society of individual property owners pursuing their own interests” (Monks and Minow, 2004, pg .101). Owners may use property as they wish . Some important rights are access to information and participat ion in key decisions; the right to regulate others’ use of their property and the right to transfer their shares /property. However, while the rights of ownership appear to be clear, the responsibility of ownership, particularly as to the effect it has on others, is not so obvious (Monks and Minow, 2004). And yet, two critical functions expected of investors as owners: 1) allocation of scarce resources based on the merits of differing investment opportunities and 2) pressuring managements of poor performing firms to do better by exiting or voicing their concerns (Hoskisson et al. , 2002 pg .698). Owners performing these functions are key for fulfilling the capitalist tenet and ac hieving more efficient and fairer allocation of rewards . So, moral press ure is put on owners to live up to the se expectations (see UK and Amec Stewardship Codes) .", "Table 2-2 Ownership Concepts # Theoretical Propositions Sources Theme/Code: Ownership 3 Owners will look after their own property by pressuring management to improve firm performance either by exiting or by voicing their concerns.

In contrast, agency theory (Jensen and Meckling , 1976) sees investors as owners of equity capital (principals) who hire managers (agents) , but both are economic actors see king to maximize utility and no moral judgements are involved goal. A third concept originating in economics describes investors as “traders” whose interest is maximizing financial returns.

These authors argue that this concept prevails among fund managers and company managers.", "“Universal owners” refers to large investors with a long -term outlook whose holdings are diversified geographica lly, across asset classes, and investment opportunities, who are exposed to the economy and to positive and negative externalities. Consequently, it is in their interest to support reforms that improve the economy and reduce exposure to social and environm ental impacts costs (Hawley and Williams, 2000, 2007). For these investors, the option to exit may be difficult so engaging might be a better option. They would seek 1) the improvement in corporate governance quality, 2) the minimization of negative extern alities arising from corporate production activity and 3) that corporations contribute to the economy (Martin et al. , 2007 pg.5).", "McNulty and Nordberg (2016) refer to “active ownership” and say ESG applies to long -term investors willing to conciliate fina ncial returns with positive social and environmental externalities. To capture investor heterogeneity, they distinguish between two investment attitudes. The first, path (a) includes the traditional notion of legal owners exercising exit and voice; “trader s” pursuing only financial interests, index or algorithmic investing; opportunistic activism; and those who exit when disagreeing with company business policy. The second path (b) is differentiated because it involves “psychological ownership” and thus cog nitive and affective mechanisms make investor engagement qualitatively different from path (a) (McNulty and Nordberg , 2016, p g.348). Psychological ownership refers to the relationship between the person/entity and the owned thing and is materially different from the legal view that arises from the rights and duties of contracting parties (Sikavica and Hillman, Certain of these views on ownership are associated with the idea that the owner is an individual, however, the current configuration of ownership is that most shares are held by institutional investors who are the record holders on behalf of – ultimately individuals – the beneficial owners. This gives rise to another layer of agency issues with implications to governance ( Gilson and Gordon, 2013), and as a result, institutional investor behavior towards governance may have determinants other than the rights and duties arising from ownership.", "2.6 Determinants of Institutional Investors Engagement", "Institutional investors are agents - intermedi aries between the beneficial owner of the shares and the company. They add a layer of management and a double set of agency issues – that between the manager of the investee company and the institutional investor and that between the latter and the benefic ial owner. Institutional investors’ business models may steer them away from the traditional legal owner perspective and they may have little interest in or capacity to reduce the agency problem in investee companies or act on behalf of better corporate go vernance.", "According to Gilson and Gordon (2013) there were 3 political factors that led to the growth in institutional investor activity and ownership of shares in the United States: 1) the decision to fund the pension system privately instead of through s ocial security; 2) the enactment of the Employee Retirement Income and Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) ; and 3) the subsequent move of employer - funded pension from defined benefit, where the risk of underfunding is borne by the employer, to defined contributio n where managing such risk is up to the employee. This not only fostered the growth of the mutual fund industry but also allowed substantial pools of money to be invested with", "diversification. Other factors that contributed to the concentration of ownershi p in institutional hands were tax incentives for pension investing under institutional schemes and the development of “portfolio theory”. The latter was underpinned by the findings that “ (i) diversification improves risk - adjusted returns; (ii) the broader the portfolio, the greater the diversification; and (iii) since secondary markets in seasoned equities are highly efficient, the fixed cost of research is best spread across large portfolios ” (Gilson and Gordon, 2013 pg.885) . Institutional investors are ex pected to incorporate learnings from portfolio theory in their portfolio design, thus construct diversified portfolios. The obvious approach to institutional investors propensity towards activism is classifying them by legal type. Ryan and Schneider (2002 ) develop ed a model for investor propensity towards activism electing f our types of investors: pension funds (public and private), mutual funds, insurance companies and banks. In a more recent approach, Çelik and Isaksson (2013) , enlarge the list of “tradi tional” types by adding “alternative” investors such as hedge funds, private equity firms, exchange -traded funds, sovereign wealth funds and asset managers who have become important players in the past 20 years. They note, however, there are several empiri cal difficulties to observing institutional investor behavior towards ownership responsibilities. Lack of information and double counting are two of them . Pension funds may invest though private equity and mutual funds as well as outsourc ing funds to asset managers, who themselves m ight be arms of other traditional investors such as insurance companies and financial institutions (Çelik and Isaksson, 2013 ). Thus, cross - investments, outsourcing of management and developments in trading practices (dar k pools and off - exchange platforms) have added complexity to the analysis.", "One type of ownership outsourcing is hiring proxy advisors, who offer the service of providing voting recommendations and exercising the proxy voting.

They also found strong evidence that both prior period and ongoing changes in governance mechanisms were associated with changes in go vernance -sensitive institutional ownership.

Typically, meetings occ ur annually on a regular basis but can become more frequent if the company is going through a special moment like a merger, a spin -off, a large issuance of debt or equity.

Another view differentiates all company -stakeholder communication from “Dialogue” with a capital “D”, de fined as a “process where corporations and shareholder activist groups mutually agree to ongoing communications to deal with a serious social issue” (Logsdon and Van Burren III , 2008 p.354).", "Private meetings can also be differentiated by motive: “tradition al” pension, mutual, and hedge fund (entrepreneurial) activism , focusing on shareholders’ interests, versus “ESG activism” or “active ownership”, involving engagement on matters that interest a broader spectrum of stakeholders (Dimson et al. , 2015). The te rm “Engagement” seems to be used by ESG practitioners, is most often observed in ESG activism literature, and is sometimes used interchangeably with activism, as in McCahery et al.

In this article, “private engagement ” means any type of private meeting, irrespective of motivation.", "The obvious implication of private engagement is that it generates private information and leads to asymmetry, which may enable higher average mutual fund returns (Cullen , Gasbarro, and Monro e, 2006). More importantly, it highlights the fuzzy line between private and material non - public information and the risk of inadvertent disclosure of the latter . Indeed, Durnev and Nain (2007) found that insider trading regulation reduced private informat ion trading at the onset of restrictions but was less effective when there were differences between control and cashflow rights. However, precisely because formal private meetings are prone to suspicion, insider information is probably transmitted via info rmal routes such as social networks (Ahren, 2017).", "Shares usually carry voting rights. In some jurisdictions most shares that are traded have voting rights on the basis one share one vote. This is considered the corporate governance best practice because political rights are proportional to the economic interest. However, companies may also issue shares with multiple votes or even restricted voting rights. The country’s legal framework will establish the types of shares that can be issued and their corresponding rights. It will also determine on which matters shareholders vote. Voting is one of the few rights shareholders have in public limited liability companies.", "It is also the country’s legal framework that will indicate whether institutional in vestors are required or not to exercise their votes. As mentioned, the American ERISA and Pension Funds Act require investors to vote, while in the UK voting is a best practice recommended the ISC’s Responsibilities of Institutional Shareholders and Agents : Statement of Principles (2002) . This has", "implications to voting turnouts. In the US, voting turnouts are higher than in the UK and Australia (Gillan and Starks, 2003). In some jurisdictions voting by institutional investors were prohibited and then reins tated (Choi and Cho, 2003). Voting is not required by the Brazilian regulator (Instrução CVM 555), but funds adopt voting policies based on Anbima’s best practices code. While the right to vote per share is a valued governance practice, actual exercising o f votes, as previously discussed, is not as straight forward. First institutional holders are not typically the beneficial holders of the shares, second, pension funds differ in their policies with regards to retaining or not voting rights when they outsou rce the fund management, and thirdly, stock lending transfers the right to vote to the borrower even without the knowledge of the beneficial shareholder. Assuming however, that the shareholder wants to vote, he will need to devote time and resources to be come sufficiently informed to make an independent judgement. If this is not enough to drive small investors away, they still need to go through the often complex and sometimes cumbersome voting processes. When cross -border voting is involved, the investors often navigate through complex country -specific rules and regulations that may further deter them from voting (Eckbo , Paone , and Urheim , 2011). Sometimes the economically viable way to exercise votes is hiring the services of proxy advisors.", "When voting, shareholders may vote with or against management by simply saying no or submitting an alternative proposal.

Gantchev (2013) ranks activist tactics in steps each of which represents a higher degree of confrontation from the previous one. These steps are 1) demand negotiations, 2) board rep resentation, 3) a proxy contest threat and 4) a proxy contest. At each step, the investor reevaluates his chance of success against the cost of pursuing a more confrontational stance or selling at market price. These costs may “i nclude disclosure, legal an d other fees of hiring proxy advisors and solicitors, corporate governance experts, investment banks, public relations and advertising firms, in addition to unobservable costs such as the time and effort of the activist (Gantchev, 2013 pg . 614). The decisi on to proceed implies that the investor will achieve a net gain after the campaign costs. The author finds that a proxy fight costs US$10.71 million on average and that mean abnormal returns decline by two -thirds due to them (Gantchev, 2013). Another facto r that may hinder activism by institutional investors is free riding by minority investors who will benefit from the appreciation in value of the stock but will not pay for the cost of interference. Even so, there may be other incentives for investors to i nterfere. Very liquid stocks, rather than inhibiting voice, may provide activists who intend to intervene with the opportunity to recover such costs by acquiring the devalued stock before the intervention, set in motion and sell it after the fact (Norli, O stergaard and Schidele, 2015). Norli et al. (2015) argue that liquid stocks enable activists to build their positions without causing changes to the stock prices and reap significant returns by trading the stock.", "2.7.2.4 Exit as a governance mechanism .", "Liquidity may also be instrumental to another form of activism: exit or its threat. Non- controlling block -holders are assumed to have the incentive to become informed and make accurate evaluations of a company’s fundamental value. When such block -holders s ell the stock, and compete in the process, the company’s share price drops to reflect its intrinsic value. This risk encourages management to invest for long -term growth and prevent their own remuneration to be dampened by lower stock prices (Edmans, 2009; Edmans and Manso, 2011 ; Admati and Pfleider, 2009 ; Edmans, Fang and Zur, 2013)", "Exit by a large institutional investor may also serve as a signal of bad news to other shareholders, precisely because large investors are thought to be better informed. Their departure from a company’s shareholder base could lead to changes in its mix – more short -term rather than long term holders and influence changes in management (Gillan and Stark, 2003), possibly with implications on price volatility.", "2.7.2.5 Shareholder coalit ions", "Shareholders may unite to vote in favor of shared interests. These coalitions are loose, ad hoc, and established for a specific aim ( e.g., to remove incumbent management, to react to a take‐ over announcement ). Longer term arrangements are difficult to observe due to their confidential nature and the fact that disclosure of intentions requirements may apply. Crespi and Renneboog (2010) estimate the relation between executive board restructuring and different measures of shareholder concentration. They f ind that shareholder coalitions outperform other concentration measures. The also find that coalitions of executive directors succeed in repelling attempts to discipline underperforming management. Thus, unless management has sufficient relative voting power, managerial disciplining is made either by large corporations or by coalitions of institutions (Crespi and Renneboog, 2010).", "2.8 Selected cases of early pension fund activism", "Understanding cases of early pension fund activism is important because there is a “pro- activity” aspect to their behavior in the sense that they do not refrain from investing in companies in which they identify issues they dislike. Instead, they invest and then try to influence management to make changes. This behavior is different fro m a “reactive” or “defensive” activism where the investor sees no issues with the company a priori and reacts when something that displeases them happens. Going forward we will make this distinction between pro -active and reactive activism. One of the cl assical cases of pension fund activism is that of the Teachers Insurance Annuity Association –College Retirement Equities Fund (TIAA -CREF). Carleton, Nelson and Weisbach (1998) analyzed the private correspondence between TIAA -CREF and targeted firms (1992 -96) and found its private efforts to persuade companies in promoting the desired changes turned out to be successful prior to TIAA -CREF submitting a resolution for vote. The benefits of activism varied depending on the issue at hand (negative onboard divers ity, positive on the targeting date for blank check preferred issues; insignificant or no benefit on confidential voting issues and changes in", "accounting measures of performance). The main takeaway from this study, however, is the importance of private neg otiations between institutions and the corporations.", "Another widely researched case of pension fund activism is that of California Public Employees’ Retirement System (“CalPERS or the “System”). CalPERs activist practice initiated in 1986 and has changed over time. It was the main participant in the creation of the Council of Institutional Investors (CII)9 in 198410 and was involved in shaping federal and state level policies. In those early days of activism, CalPERs targeted portfolio companies with both g overnance issues (e.g., poison pills), and poor performance. The size of the firm in their portfolio and whether it had high institutional ownership were also criteria for selection. Their targets would be subject to shareholder resolutions in the followin g proxy season. CalPERS also tested a less adversarial approach by sending letters to the Chairman of the Board or the CEO requesting a meeting where they would make their governance improvement requests prior to submitting the resolution to a vote. Coming to an agreement with the company was the preferred solution because even if the resolution won a majority vote, it would still be non -binding (Smith, 1996).", "In 1992 it changed its approach by publishing its first Focus List with five to ten underperform ing companies with poor governance they would watch during the year. This was the short list of a larger list of companies they contacted and established a dialogue with the CEO and other independent directors (Anson, White, Ho, 2004). Ten years later its approach changed again. Two lists were produced. The Monitoring list contained companies that had agreed with the implementation of reforms and the Focus List with those companies who did not. Only the Focus List became public (Smythe, McNeil and English I I, 2015). Since 2010, CalPERS non longer publishes the Focus list and privately engages the targeted underperforming firms (Zheng and Zhong, 2017). Smith (1996) found that firms targeted by CalPERs were larger, had poor stock performance, and more institu tional ownership than his control sample. The pension fund succeeded in settling for the requested governance changes in most of the companies over the six -year sample -period, and, although the operating performance of those companies was positive, the inc rease was small. Similarly, those that did not settle had small negative variations in operating performance. Recent studies found that there was more value in the activism directed towards smaller companies that had performed poorly and had large boards ( Smythe et al. 2015) and that operating performance of", "9 https://www.cii.org/index.asp", "10 The CII is a governa nce best practice non -profit organization serving the interests of member institutional investors and asset owners.

Becht, Franks, Mayer and Rossi (2009), found that when their engagement effort was achieved it was both economically large and had a statistically significant abnormal returns around the announcement date of the changes (Becht et al. , 2009).", "HUKFF was set up as a separate entity from Hermes, who manages British Telecom Pension and the Post Office Staff Superannuation Schemes, because the trustees of those entities thought that intensified engagement required overweight positions in underperfor ming stocks which could not be achieved by their core investments. Thus, HUKFF has other investors and is run independently from Hermes. It conducts activism through private interventions rather than shareholder proposals or proxy statements. It will only embark on an activist trajectory towards a company, if three conditions are met. First, the company stock price should be underperforming. Second, HUKFF should believe it can engage the company successfully and third, it can expect a 20% appreciation over the company’s current share price. If met, the fund would increase its position and engage management to present the changes it seeks (Becht et al. , 2009).", "Engagement involved meetings and correspondence with the CEO and the Chairman but could also include other members from management such as divisional managers, head of investor relations, and non -executive board members. HUKFF also contacted other institutional shareholders to tell them of their engagement intentions and to seek support – especially if i t was necessary to call for (or make a threat) an extraordinary general meeting which can be done with 10% of the voting capital under UK law.", "Change objectives included restructuring operations mainly divesting of non -core activities and assets and limiti ng acquisitions, replacing the CEO or the Chairman, and increasing cash pay - outs to shareholders. The most favorable outcome was when management adopted the requested changes. HUKFF would then wait until changes were implemented, announced, and incorporate d into the share price. It then divested with a profit. If the company’s reaction was negative or mixed, HUKFF would escalate. It would try to remove the CEO or Chairman that was not in support of its changes. To strengthen its position HUKFFs ownership wa s higher and lasted longer, on average, in confrontational engagements. Other confrontational actions included threats to block rights issues, press campaigns, but generally actions were of a private nature – visits, meetings, phone calls, letter writing ( Becht et al. , 2009).", "These cases indicate that pension funds have, overtime, adopted different strategies but pro - actively approached companies’ management requesting change and used more belligerent practices – publicity and shareholder proposals – to voi ce their plea if companies were not compliant. 2.9 Mutual funds are not expected to be activists.", "Despite holding large portions of equities and thereby having the power to pressure management, Gilson and Gordon (2013) state that mutual funds are not proactive in putting forward proxy proposals but will frequently join others opposing management on core governance issues (e.g. , poison pills, staggard boards). They argue that this behavior is due to the agency cost of “a gency capitalism”; i.e., profit seeking asset managers strive to achieve superior relative performance and minimizing costs is part of that process. Acting towards the improvement of the performance of the investee companies will benefit the beneficial hol der of their funds but also that of their competitors so there is no incentive to pursue that route. In fact, the authors believe this behavior locks -in managerial slack and is an added agency cost. Their main claim is that governance rights are undervalue d because to use them effectively funds will have to analyze and follow companies in detail and engage in expensive activism.", "Factors that work against governance proactivity are: (1) Diversification. It leads to fragmented portfolios where individual comp any weights might be too low. So even if the investor is successful in his actions the improvement effect might not be enough to make a difference in his portfolio but will certainly add to its costs. 2) Evaluation of the fund based on relative performance . When performance is measured relative to a benchmark or peers, working towards improving the governance of one company will benefit all competitors and not necessarily allow the activist to distinguish himself. 3) Fund manager compensation. When compensa tion related to fund size and superior relative performance is what brings in more funds, there will be no incentive for activism. 4) Evaluation based on absolute performance. If evaluation is based on absolute performance the investment focus is most like ly on asset allocation where equities is just one asset class. Thus, the analysis favors macro movements where the performance of individual companies may matter even less if submerged in general market movements. Mutual funds expect to be recognized by th e quality of their portfolio management rather than by developing alternative better strategies for investee companies (Gilson and Gordon, 2013).", "On the possibility that mutual funds might be conflicted in voting against management because investee compan ies might be their clients for managing company pension fund money, Davis", "and Ham Kim (2005) found that funds generally followed a voting policy irrespective of the investee. Their findings did not support the hypothesis that funds voted with management wh en there were commercial ties with the portfolio company nor that investors were more prone to activism when the size of their holding was large. The authors state this result is not surprising because the research was done in the period after the SEC mand ated disclosure of voting policies by mutual funds in 2004. However, they found that at the family level funds were less likely to vote against management when there were more business ties to portfolio companies (Davis and Ham Kim, 2005). These findings a re corroborated with those by Asharf and Ryan (2012) at the firm -proposal level, confirming the view that fund families with business ties vote with management at all firms, who suggest that “fund families with pension -related ties are less insulated from management pressures than fund families without ties” and that mutual funds would not be as “pressure -resistant” as initially proposed (Ashraf and Ryan, 2012). Funds that were in the same educational network as the firm’s executives were more likely to vot e with management and against shareholder -initiated proposals to limit executive compensation than out -of-network funds (Butler and Gurum, 2012).", "3 The Brazilian Institutional Setting and Context: Capital Markets and", "Corporate Governan ce As stated, this research adopts the perspective that institutions – both formal and informal – are relevant for organizations and their behavior.

Another example is the share of funds invested in equities by institutional investors. According to Anbima Fund Manager Ranking Report, investment in equities represented 10% of total invested by institutional investors in November 2020 (Anbimab). This is still a small fraction of total amount invested by institutional investors however, the same figure was 5% in December 2015. If a low interest rates environment remains the norm for the foreseeable future, we are likely to see a structural shift in the weight of stocks relative to other forms of fixed income investments increasing the demand for equity in institutional investors’ portfolios. However, these changes are too recent to infer longer term trends.", "3.1 Capital varieties approach to country comparis ons.", "The capital varieties approach compares capitalist economies placing firms as central actors. Firms are viewed as relational entit ies, whose success to produce products and services profitably depends on the coordination of relationships with other a ctors. The five key relationships which interact and must be coordinated are 1) industrial relations (wages, work conditions and productivity levels); 2) vocational training and education (the ability to obtain labor with suitable skills and the workforce’ s willingness to invest in developing such skills); 3) corporate governance (access to financing/assurance of returns on investment ); 4) inter -firm relations (clients, suppliers, services – stable demand for products and access to technology) and 5) employ ees (ensure competencies and cooperation) (Halls and Soskice, 2001) Different countries are characterized by the way this coordination is conducted with consequences to corporate governance. The latter is embedded in the country’s institutional environme nt with implications as to how governance mechanism interact and are effective. Two models typify developed economies: liberal market economies (LME) and coordinated market economies (CME). In liberal market economies, “firms coordinate their activities p rimarily via hierarchies and competitive market arrangements ” where “m arket relationships are characterized by the arm's -length exchange of goods or services in a context of competition and formal contracting. In coordinated market economies, firms depend more heavily on nonmarket relationships to coordinate their endeavors with other actors to construct their core competencies. These non -market modes of coordination generally entail more extensive relational or incomplete contracting, network", "monitoring ba sed on the exchange of private information , inside networks, and more reliance on collaborative, as opposed to competitive, relationships to build the competencies of the firm ” (Solstice & Hall, 2004 pg 8) . The United States and Britain are the prime LME e xamples while Germany and Japan represent CMEs. Two other models typify other developed and undeveloped economies: family market or hierarchical market economies (FLME or HME) and state -led market economies (SLME). Latin American countries are classified a s FLME or hierarchical market economies (HME). Given the varieties of capitalism focus on corporate governance and labor relations, the core features of these economies are family -owned diversified business groups, multinationals (MNCs), atomistic labor re lations and low skills (Schneider, 2009). The region lacks institutions to intermediate employment relations within firms and to incentivize investment in skills and training. Educational levels remain low with little public or private investment in traini ng.", "Large companies in Latin America are either diversified family -owned conglomerates or multinationals (MNCs). Domestic firms share four points in common: 1) they are diversified into subsidiaries that conduct activities with no market or technological a ffinities; 2) the group maintains hierarchical control over the subsidiaries; 3) a small number of huge groups control large portions of GDP; and 4) groups have been owned and managed by large families for several generations. Both diversification and fami ly control introduce hierarchies in governance while large control blocks mean these families do not need to do much negotiating with other block -holders. Because these businesses represent large chunks of GDP it is likely they exert power over competitors , suppliers and clients (Schneider, 2009).", "MNCs are the other group of large companies in Latin America. They also conduct hierarchical coordination for technology and capital transfers, and some relations with suppliers, clients, and trade. Much of their exchanges are intra -company emphasizing the hierarchical nature of coordination (Schneider, 2009).", "Together domestic conglomerates and MNCs accounted for significant portions of GDP and were key channels for accessing capital, technology, and markets throu gh verticalization and hierarchy. According to Schneider (2009), these two groups “ impeded movement towards both markets in corporate governance and coordination in inter -firm relations ” (Schneider, 2009, pg. 565). They substituted capital markets and slow ed their development.", "Comparing the role of corporate actors in the different types of capitalism, we note that in family market economies both managers and the board of directors protect the interests of the controlling family. If, on one hand, agency pro blems between controlling shareholders and managers", "have less room to develop, the board of directors could be an ineffective mechanism to safeguard the interests of minority shareholders, whose interest might not be necessarily aligned with that of contro lling shareholders. Examples of mechanisms through which controlling shareholders may expropriate minority shareholders are targeted issues and repurchases of securities, transfer of assets, entrenchment, exploitation of a business relationship with contro lled companies through transfer pricing, seeking to fulfill personal objectives rather than the maximization of shareholder value Under family market economies, both internal and external governance mechanisms offer weak protection to minority shareholders. The market for corporate control, for example, is non - existent. The implication is that one of the most effective mechanisms for the correction of company underperformance is simply not there to protect minority shareholders or consu mers. The prevailing legal tradition is civil law which, in addition to offering less protection for investors, is usually not enforced with the satisfactory speed and outcomes (La Porta et al. , 1999). While the strong presence of owners in the companies’ administration may work towards reducing classical agency problems between managers and owners, boards may not see themselves as representing the interests of minority shareholders. Thus, when company controlling shareholders are clearly defined and minor ities shareholders are involved, principal -principal agency issues prevail. They occur because ownership is concentrated. In many emerging markets this conflict may be exacerbated by lack of the institutional infrastructure for appropriate governance and d ysfunctional external governance mechanisms, which should operate in conjunction with internal mechanisms. Additionally, reliance on internal controls , as explained above, brings little relief (Dharwadkar and George, 2000). The implication for emerging economies is subdued activism by investors since exit is optimal for minority shareholders. Young et al. , (2008) argue that principal -principal conflicts may increase monitoring costs in emerging economies because: ambiguous in stitutional structures make enforcement difficult; managers represent owners’ interest and may circumvent monitoring mechanisms; and share prices carry less information due to small free floats and capital markets’ less effective monitoring mechanisms. Fur thermore, costs incurred by agents to ensure they will not harm principals (bonding costs) may also increase. The most typical of these are cross -listing (Young et al., 2008) and premium listing segments.", "In fact, Silveira and Dias Jr. (2009) measure the costs of conflicts between controlling and minority shareholders in Brazil by using event study methodology in 24 cases where such dispute gained the media. Their hypothesis is that when such disputes become public, relevant agency costs", "are taking place. They find ample support for their hypothesis. Companies lose 6.6 percent of value on the publicity date. These losses reach 12 percent over the following fifteen days. They estimate that the value loss ranged from US$ 325 to 497 million for each company (S ilveira and Dias Jr .,", "3.2 Corporate Ownership in Brazil", "Ownership concentration at the company level is observed in several markets in the world. The three largest shareholders own 50% of the capital in half of the world’s listed companies and 30% in three quarters of these companies ( De La Cruz, Medina and Tang, 2019). Concentration in Brazil is even higher since on average, 61.27% of the voting shares of publicly traded companies is held by the largest shareholder (Sternberg et.al. , 2011). Concen tration is higher in the regular, N1 and N2 listing segments (Leal et.al. , 2002 ; Gorga, 2009 ; Pinto , 2013) or via shareholder’s agreements despite growing dispersion (Sternberg et.al. , 2011).

In 1997, Congress removed certain important rights from the Corporate Law11, weakening the protection of minority shareholders with respect to changes in control and created a favorable environment for delisting. Changes led minority shareholders not to receive the economic value of their shares in various freeze out offers. In those “dark ages”, investors were not the only losers. From 1990 to 2005, the Stock Exchange (B3) lost one third of its listings. Of 234 companies, half left between 1998 to 2001 (Source: B3a).

Companies that want to list their shares in the stock exchange must register with the CVM. The Law allows the issuance of dual class, ordinary and preferred shares. Ordinary shares have the right of one vote per share. Multiple voting rights per share is not permitted but the company’s charter may limi t voting rights. Preferred shares may not have voting rights but, if so, are assured a minimum dividend (25% of profits or 3% the book value of the shares, or 10% higher than dividends distributed to the ordinary shares) and have precedence over ordinary shares on the return of capital. Preferred shares may acquire voting rights if the company fails to pay mandatory dividends for three consecutive years. They also have the rights to elect separately a member of the board of directors.", "Initially, the Lei da s SAs allowed the company to issue as much as two -thirds of its capital in preferred shares. This permitted family -owned companies and the government to raise capital in the market without losing control. The prime example of this usage was the state -owned telecommunications holding company, Telebras. The government’s control stake - a little over 50% of the company’s voting capital – only corresponded to 20% of its total capital! This control stake was sold at a premium in the privatization auctions in 199 8. After that Law 10 ,303 of 2001 reformed the Lei das SAs. and limited the maximum of preferred shares that could be issued to 50% (Almeida and Leal, 2020).", "The Lei das SAs defines and attributes responsibilities to the controlling shareholder including s ituations where there could be abuse of such power and conflict of interest (Art. 117, Section IV of Law 6404/76). It also allows shareholders representing at least 1/10th of the company’s voting capital to request cumulative voting for directors (Art. 141 ). Ordinary shareholders representing 15% of the total voting shares and preferred shareholders representing 10% of the total capital will be allowed to elect one member of the board each in a separate voting session where the controlling shareholder does not vote.", "Brazil’s corporate law allows shareholders to elect a three -to-five-member Fiscal Board.

The Fiscal Board can provide an effective protection instrument to outside shareholders if its members are qualifie d, independent and the administration does give them access to the materials they need to perform their work well. They also have the advantage of being able to make requests and opine individually because it is not a collegiate body as the board of direct ors. Its main weakness is not being permanent for most companies, and of course, just as boards, they can be filled with rubber stampers.", "When the United States passed Sarbanes -Oxley Act in 2002, Brazilian companies who had cross -listed in the NYSE had t o comply. Many of those were state or former state -controlled companies who already had a permanent fiscal board. Brazilian companies were able to convince the SEC to accept those who had permanent fiscal boards as SOX compliant. Thus, many may perceive the fiscal board and the audit committee to be bodies that perform the same function. In fact, Bortolon, Silva and Barros (2019) found that when a company has an audit committee , requests for the installation of a fiscal board were less frequent. They also f ound that these requests were more frequent in companies with large boards, worse performance (ROE) and who had shareholders’ agreements (Bortolon, Silva and Barros, 2019 ). The key point with regards to the fiscal board is that it can used by shareholders to monitor the companies more closely. Minority shareholders are assured a seat and it has a lower threshold of ownership to be met to be able to request its installment. Enforcement of investor rights is a key element in investor protection. Howeve r, in Brazil, enforcement is deficient for two reasons. First, lawsuits dealing with violation of shareholder rights are handled by non -specialized State Court judges who lack both the know -how and jurisprudence due to the absence of precedent cases. Also , courts may take a considerable amount of time to reach a decision making it costly for the pleading party. The second reason are the limited powers of CVM. It can only access information that is protected by bank secrecy law on a case -by-case bases by requesting the judiciary to grant it access or through the cooperation of the Central Bank. It is also affected by personnel and financial constraints (Silveira and Dias Jr, 2009). 3.4 Important regulatory changes .", "Over the last 20 years, the Brazilian regulation evolved in the direction of better governance.

The second was the introduction of the “Formulário de Referencia” (FR), or reference form, by CVM’s Instruction 480/2009 and amendments. The FR upgraded Brazilian publicly traded companies’ disclosure standards to something similar and along the lines of the American 10 -K. Prior to that, little information was required of them in annual reports. Only the country’s largest companies who had cross -listed in US exchanges were providing regular, thorough disclosures in their 20 -F (equivalent of the 10 -K for foreign issuers). Those companies that were only listed in the local exchange provided next to nothing of information. In addition to standardized disclosure, the FR speeded up follow -on issuance of stock or debentures since the company’s information would always be updated and issuances could combine the FR with informati on on the company with the prospectus with the specifics of the transaction.", "The third important regulatory change was CVM Instruction 586/2017.

The code was a bottom -up experience elaborated by 11 capital market entities – GT Interagentes12 - among them representatives of pension funds, asset managers, investor relations professionals and the I nstituto Brasileiro de Governança Corporativa (IBGC). It is a watered -down version of IBGC’s own governance code and is intended to be relatively easy to be complied with as way to incentive companies to accept and comply.

Lava -jato was a sophisticated corruption scheme involving construction companies, company manage rs and the illegal financing of political parties, including the then presidential party. The law is applicable to all state -owned (federal, state, and municipal) and those that are publicly traded and have private shareholders as well. Its main merit from a governance standpoint was to impose restrictions and requirements for the board of directors and fiscal board members . In addition to a relevant career and proven experience, board members cannot be government officials. They cannot be regulating agenc y officials or union workers; they cannot have occupied decision - making positions in political parties in the past 36 months or other positions where conflict of interest is possible. The law also requires companies to introduce a chartered audit committe e and internal auditing reporting directly to the audit committee. It grants minority shareholders the right of electing one board member irrespective of reaching the minimum threshold for cumulative voting. This Law can be an important tool to improve gov ernance of state - owned companies. This seems to have been the case in some publicly traded state -owned companies (Duarte and Leal, 2021).", "Changes in the voting process in General Meetings (GM). Having to show up in person to vote was one of the items considered by La Porta et.al. (1998) as making it difficult for shareholders to exercise voting rights in comparison to countries where investors simply mailed -in their votes. In 2018 (Instrução CVM 561/15), the Brazilian regulator made the availability o f electronic voting mandatory, so investors may “mail” their votes electronically using digital certification. Instruction 481/2009 and subsequent amendments, regulates the procedures for companies to call for a GM. The GM is announced 3013 days prior to the date. When announced, management proposal and the proxy statement is made public. The names of board candidates and shareholder proposals need to be submitted up prior to the GM, including the request for the formation of a fiscal board. The proxy statement is republished prior to the meeting and distance votes must be recorded prior to the meeting. Requests for cumulative voting must be submitted; the custodian delivers its proxy votes and company makes public a synthetic voting charts w ith the votes it received so far.

So further improvements may still be necessary for this action to become effective in reducing voting costs.", "Despite the progress in regulation, over this period -of-time, so me decisions by the regulator, CVM and insider trading cases that go unpunished by the public prosecutor14, reveal there is a long way to go before minority shareholders may feel adequately protected. One prime example of these episodes was the acquittal, b y the regulator, of Petrobras’ board members in five processes related to the Lava -jato corruption scheme. This was the largest corporate corruption scheme in the world. It “stole” US$100 billion of value from shareholders (retirees, individuals, the Brazi lian Federal Union, local and foreign institutional investors).

Not only because it attracts most of the new listings but because NM companies now account for 51% of the market capita lization in both main indices, Ibovespa and IBX - 100. Contributing to this outcome was the fact that some large market caps such as Vale – one of the world’s largest mining conglomerates – converted their preferred shares into ordinaries and joined NM. Also , both state -owned Banco do Brasil and Petrobras, when taking public their insurance and oil distribution subsidiaries, respectively, did so in NM.

One such influence was the adoption of the investor relations practice . Some companies understood i ts essence: that building relationships involves ongoing communication with investors, including management, board members and controlling share holders. Thus, another important, and rarely mentioned, change in the market was the establishment the Investor Relations practice. Back in 1993, CVM Instruction 202/93 instituted the Director of Capital Markets Relations. This was the name given to one of the chartered members of the executive board who would be responsible for providing the market with mandated disclosures. The nominee could accumulate the title with any other function and typically CFOs are given this responsibility. But in the late 1990 s when Brazilian companies began listing in the NYSE and structuring their", "investor relations departments, CVM changed the name of this executive board member to “Director of Investor Relations” (DRI) (CVM Instrução 309/99). When CVM instituted the FR, in a similar fashion to the Sarbanes -Oxley requirements, both the CEO and the DRI were required to certify that the information in the FR and Financial Statements accurately represented the company’s financial condition. The regulator also demands companies t o keep a website and hold one public meeting per year. Strictly speaking DRI is a compliance function and is associated with but does not consist of, substantially, the voluntary activities that characterize investor relations. However, this regulator induced “syncretism” has led many to interpret that investor relations is obligatory in Brazil. Irrespective of the conceptual mess, the voluntary practice of investor relations is firmly established. Most companies will designate professionals to form an inve stor relations team. Companies provide all mandated and voluntary information in readily accessible and, usually, quite standardized websites, many regularly hold earnings conference calls, issue press releases, and conduct all the routinized communication activities the comprise investor relations. Investors know they have a point of access to their investees, with people who are prepared to answer their questions and arrange meetings with their CFOs, CEOs and Board Members.

(2017) mapped various types and examples of activism, constructed an activism index, and related it to a corporate governance index for 2008, 2010 and 2012. They detected that despite an overall increase, activism remained low throughout the period and several i ndex components held steady or declined. The activism indicators that presented more growth in the period were proposals presented by minority shareholders and cumulative voting requests to elect directors. They also noted a reduction in the number of prop osals that were approved unanimously and the number of companies that did not experience at least one activist event. They found that activism was more frequent in larger companies and had a higher index score on those with poorer governance practices (Var gas et al. , 2017).", "Guimarães et al. (2018) assessed the types of firms that were targets for activism and measured the impact of activism on efficiency. They used the Vargas et al. (2018) activism index and data envelopment analysis (DEA) to generate effi ciency scores and bootstrapped truncated regression to assess whether activism targets less efficient firms. Their findings suggest activists targeted less efficient companies , but the level of activism did not predict future efficiency improvements (Guima rães et al. , 2019) .", "Maranho et al. (2020) assume that the degree and form of engagement varies according to the investment objective of the institutional investor on the investee company, therefore, they score firm-investor pairs considering various activism markers and the impact on each firms’ corporate governance practices. They found that the average score of their firm -investor index was lower than half of the maximum score possible suggesting that investor activism and independence is not high in Brazil even when large shareholders a re involved. They were able to distinguish among investor types and origin and detected that asset managers were less active than other institutional investors. They also found that long term holders and foreign investors were related to better company governance practices while being a board member and signatory of a shareholders’ agreement was associated with worse company governance practices possibly because these investors are insiders and therefore aligned with management. They found no significant im pact of activism on corporate", "governance either at the firm -investor pairs level nor at the company aggregated institutional investor score (Maranho et al. , 2020).", "Collares (2020) scored manifestations of activism that were made public in minutes of share holder meetings to create an index which was subsequently related to governance practices and company performance. She found a negative and significant relationship between activism and governance indicating that companies with better governance practices such as premium listing segments and particularly, independent board members suffered less activism. The relationship between activism and performance, however, was not significant and therefore inconclusive. The author infers that corporate governance, ra ther than performance, motivates investors to act in Brazilian companies (Collares, 2020).", "Yamahaki and Fyrnas (2016) qualitatively investigated whether regulation encouraged private shareholder engagement in Brazil and South Africa. They interviewe d institutional investors – mainly Principles of Responsible Investment (PRI) signatories. Their findings suggest that while legislation provided limited direct encouragement of private engagement, it did enhance asset managers’ understanding of and intere st in Responsible Investment practices, thereby reducing pension funds’ concerns about failure to fulfill fiduciary duties. They concluded that r egulation promote d an ‘enabling environment’ for ESG engagement (Yamahaki and Fyrnas , 2016). Pension funds are important institutional investors. Investments from Brazil’s pension funds represented circa 14.1% of GDP in 2020 and investment in equities and equity funds represented 18% of total pension fund investment (A brapp ). Thus, much research has been devoted t o this type of institutional investor. Crisóstomo and González (2006) investigated whether pension fund participation in companies improved performance. They observed there was an increase in the participation of pension funds in Brazilian companies’ share holder base between 1995 -2002 although the growth of their presence among the five largest voting shareholders was not significant in the period. They were not able to affirm that the presence of pension funds among the five largest shareholders had an imp act on company performance, although, in 2002 companies with at least one pension fund among the five largest shareholder presented better performance indicator averages, and significant increases in dividend payout (Crisóstomo and Gonzales, 2006).", "Puns uvo, Kayo and Barros (2006) investigated the influence of pension funds on companies’ corporate governance quality. They expected that when pension funds were part of the control block and frequently participated on boards, the relationship between pension fund participation and governance quality would be inverse. They found this relationship to be significant (5% level) and", "negative and interpreted it to result from the fact that when there are few controlling shareholders, the larger their share in the total capital the less need to invest in governance quality. In that sense, when companies’ ownership is concentrated, a large participation could function as a substitute for quality governance (Punsuvo et al. 2006).", "De Oliveira, Leal and Almeida (2012) look into th e relationship between three of the largest Brazilian pension funds (Previ, Petros and Funcef) as relevant shareholders and find that their presence is not associated with better company corporate governance. They note however that their scores are highly correlated with the stock exchange’s premium listing segments and company size. They find it reasonable to expect that larger companies would have both the means and the incentive to implement better corporate governance practices. It is quite possible these large pension funds prefer to have their more relevant holdings in larger companies with consistent past profitability, which happen to be the same companies that have better corporate governance. Thus, it may well be that variables are endo genous and that these large institutional investors elect liquidity as their key investment criterion. They also consider it possible that these pension funds – which are sponsored by state -owned companies – make decisions based on the political criteria o r priorities of the incumbent government. Such perspectives are not necessarily consistent with corporate governance best practices in which case the impact relevant shareholdings by these institutions may have on corporate governance practices might not b e detected (De Oliveira et al., 2012).", "Sonza and Granzotto (2018) question whether pension funds are good monitors. They find that pension funds participating in companies’ control structures is negatively associated to efficiency measured by ROA and ROE a nd with market performance (Tobin’s Q). They attribute this outcome to the lack of adequate monitoring skills by pension funds, who may, in fact create conflicts that go against maximizing company’s value (Sonza and Granzotto, 2018).", "De Almeida and Leal ( 2020) examine two cases where two state-owned company pension funds acted but were not entirely successful in their attempts to change the course of decisions made at their investee companies. The authors investigate whether the outcome in these cases aris e from the lack of skills (Sonza et al., 2018), or of interest to engage (Punsuvo et al. , 2007), or due to alignment of interests with government policy in lieu of that of minority shareholders (Maranho et al. 2020). The cases are interesting because they reveal that it takes more than size and influence to be successful when advocating against the concentration of ownership or better governance practices. They highlight the fact that active investing is risky even for deep pocket players. In these cases, t he negative outcome for the pension funds is attributed to their failure in anticipating the changes that", "were about to happen in their investees (a major control reconcentration in one case; and a more aggressive management/strategic style coupled with le gal issues relating to sanitary licenses in the other). Another important point observed in the study was that in one of the cases the two pension funds were at opposite positions. With respect the purpose of the investigation, the authors concluded that t hese funds showed a keen interest in acting. Because in one of the cases the two pension funds were in opposition, they suggest the funds were acting in the best interest of their beneficiaries rather than following political guidance from the government. Overall, they concur with the view of previous studies in that pension funds lack the necessary skills for effective activism (Sonza and Granzotto, 2018) and the presence of these institutions in companies’ investor base does little for the improvement of their corporate governance or performance (De Oliveira et.al. ; 2012, Punsuvo et al. , 2007 ; De Almeira and Leal, 2020).", "A second major institutional investor which has been singled out in research is BNDESPar, the investment arm of BNDES. Lazzarini and Mus acchio (2010) found that BNDESPar, as a minority shareholder contributes to the increase the company’s return on assets possibly because their capital constraints are reduced with the banks long -term equity commitment and loans. However, this was not the c ase when this investment was made in state -owned companies, where government interference was possible or in private -domestic pyramidal groups, where there was potential for minority shareholder expropriation (Lazzarini et al. , 2010). Thus, deployment of t ax-payer funds on equity positions of private or mixed capital companies does not render uniform results to all companies.", "Duarte and Leal (2021) examine multiple cases where BNDESPar disputed with other investee controlling shareholders. Two cases concern a large protein producer JBS, whose international expansion received the support of BNDES equity and loans. The third and fourth were related to the Rio de Janeiro electricity distributer, Light, a company controlled by Cemig, the electricity producer and distributer of the State of Minas Gerais and who was controlled by the State with the same name.", "In the first case, BNDESPar opposed JBS’ board member compensation. The company’s board had members of the family who controlled JBS through a holding company . The latter as well as key family members were involved in corruption and as the scandal unfolded with indictments and legal proceedings, JBS lost market value, hurting minority shareholders. When the case was escalated to the regulator, CVM, it became ob vious that jurisprudence regarding the controlling shareholder’s right to vote in conflict -of-interest situations was not consolidated. CVM’s collegiate voted that it", "was up to the controlling shareholders to declare themselves impeded. Despite BNDESPar su bstantial 13% share, CVM’s decision left them at the mercy of the family’s dominant 63.5% voting power. In the second case, BNDESPar was successful in preventing the company from implementing a corporate restructuring that would result in transferring the company’s fiscal domicile abroad. However, this success was only achieved because it was party to a shareholder’s agreement that gave it veto rights. BNDESPar’s position in this case was political: it wanted to prevent the denationalization of a company th at had benefited from subsidized loans to reach its “national champion” status. In contrast to the first case where BNDESPar was perhaps aligned to minority shareholder interests, the second case revealed its priorities were elsewhere (Duarte et al. , 2021) . We suspect BNDESPar needed to save face: they could not afford the construal of a narrative that they had wasted taxpayer money on a policy that facilitated a national champion to leave the country. BNDESPar was also involved in two disputes with Cemig i n their minority position in Light. The first was related to Light’s financial performance. Here again, the bank lost its dispute due to Cemig’s 51% share in the voting capital. The second dispute concerned the appointment of members to Light’s fiscal boar d. Here BNDESPar was supported by the newly enacted “Lei das Estatais” which established nomination criteria for board members. They were able to reap a partial success (Duarte The analysis of these cases enabled the authors to reach rich an alytical conclusions: 1) Better corporate governance practices and mechanisms alone do not protect companies from being targets of activism.", "2) Political interests guided BNDESPar in some of their activist moves.", "3) Concentration does not align the interest between shareholders.", "4) Being a minority shareholder did not hinder the bank from fighting its cause even though when they won, it was because they were able to rely on the strength of the law. 5) Ownership concentration was key for the outcome of activist moves but a lso to the instruments used by the activist shareholder to fight and resist.", "6) It is difficult for activists to achieve their goals using corporate governance mechanisms when ownership concentration is high.", "4 Methodology", "4.1 Research ques tion", "What meanings institutional investors attribute to the term s, “activism” and “engagement”? Which corporate governance practices investors value most and why and, as a result, would : a) serve as criteria for investment decisions; b) be a matter for regular engagement, and c) prompt them into action ?", "These questions have underlying assumptions, namely: investors, as shareholders, have the legal right to vote on certain company matters and are entitled to the economic benefit yielded by their property . Their legitimacy arises from the shareholder value approach to corporate governance. We also assume investors will want to act to protect their positions from expropriation.", "4.2 Research design", "To address these questions, a qualitative research project was c hosen because it permits the exploration of meanings attributed by individuals on social issues (Creswell, 2010). The primary method of data collection was interviews because the objective was to capture attitudes, values, and preferences. Interviews enabl e the researcher to ask open -ended questions and better access the views, interpretations of events, understandings, experiences, and opinions and thus achieve greater depth and complexity (Silverman, 2006).", "The philosophical approach to interview conduct ion and interpretation was constructionism. Like constructivism, constructionism is a postmodern approach that shares the view that no objective reality exists to be discovered. However, while constructivism is concerned with individual cognitive processes , constructionism emphasizes language use and communicative practices that occur in interpersonal exchanges (Rosa, Tureta and Brito, 2006) .", "The conventional view about interviews is that respondents are passive subjects who passively possess the informa tion the interviewer wants. Such information is assumed to be uncontaminated. If contamination occurs, it stems from its setting, its participants, and their interaction, but not from the subject. Thus, interview technique has developed procedures that are to be followed for obtaining untampered facts. The validity of results depends on the successful application of these techniques. The interviewer is somewhat active but should remain removed from the data to gather the information that is already there w ithout biasing the respondent ’s answers. Self -control is essential", "not to influence and not suggest frames of reference. Interviewers’ neutrality is desired, and while they may use interpersonal skills to encourage expression, they should not help construc t attitudes, sentiments, and information in questions, doing so would compromise the result. Constructionism rejects this conventional concept of the interview because it considers social interaction to be constitutive, and participants to be constructi ve subjects. In an interview, participants are always actively engaged in constructing meaning - it is a process of co -construction. Thus, the interview is reconceptualized “as an occasion for purposefully animated participants to construct versions of rea lity interactionally rather than merely purvey data” (Gubrium and Holstein, 2003 pg . 32). The interview does not discover facts, realities, or truth, it uncovers accounts, or discourses, which are part of the world they describe. Experience is embedded in the social web of interpretation and reinterpretation – how participants create meaning. So, it is inappropriate to establish accuracy, reliability, and validity because these criteria presume one ’s objective is finding reality (Silverman, 2006). The rese arch concern is to preserve “what” is being said but consider the “how” it is said is related to the experiences being studied.", "4.3 Selection of institutions for interviewing", "The purpose of this study was to explore attitudes towards activism, the corporate g overnance preferences, and more broadly, the engagement process of members of the Brazilian investment industry by examining three groups of institutional investors: independent asset managers (IAs), non - independent asset managers (NIAs) and pension funds (PF). Legal type is commonly used to distinguish behavior of institutional investors because they have different investment objectives and are subject to different constraints.", "The primary criterion for the selection of possible interview candidates was s ize of assets under management (AUM). Research has indicated that size is a critical enabler for activism. To identify the largest players in the industry two sets of ranking reports were used. The financial amount of these separate rankings cannot be adde d up because of possible double counting. Since pension funds outsource some of their investments, IAs and NIAs AUM could include assets that belong to pension funds.", "Pension funds: The ranking of pension funds in terms of AUM was obtained from two institu tions who provide almost identical data - Superintendência Nacional de Previdência Complementar – Previc, the pension fund regulating agency and Associação Brasileira das Entidades Fechadas de Previdência Complementar – Abrapp, the class association of the group. The ten largest", "institutions account for approximately 51% of pension fund AUM.

This ranking contained 556 asset managers and financial institutions. However, not all of them invest in stocks or only have minor portions of their businesses invested in stocks. So, we selected the subset ranking of entities based on the amount of stock assets under management (StockUM). There were 279 entities in this group managing US$69 billion (R$ 239 billion) of StockUM. Th is amount corresponded to 6% on average of the total AUM managed by those entities . We classified entities under two categories: 257 IAs and 22 NIAs . This classification was made by identifying those who were financial institutions while all the rest were considered asset managers even th ough there might be some family offices among them.", "IAs manage approximately US$37 billion , and their stock holdings were on average 54% of total AUM, a much larger percentage when compared with NIAs whose stock holdings were only 3% of total AUM.

We used networking relationships with members of the Instituto Brasileiro de Governança Corporativa – IBGC who were board members and people from the investment management and broker industry to help us identify and put us in contact with those people in the organizations who could respond. Even so many did not respond or declined the invitation, but we were able to secure 18 interviews under the agreement that the names of the interviewees and the institutions would be kept confidential.", "Confidentiality: confidentiality was proposed and accepted as a strategy for partners and officers to be free to express their views on matters.

Websites were checked to see if and how they", "made their voting guidance available. Samples of letter to shareholders were also examined. Most of their communication is client directed and only occasionally would contain comments that were pertinent to the topics of interest.", "Themes and topics for the analysis of interview content derive from theory. “Activis m” was defined as “actions taken by shareholders with the explicit intention of influencing corporations’ policies and practices,” (Goronova and Ryan, 2014, pg.1232) . This definition does not specify which “actions” are considered activism. “Engagement ”, on the other hand , was defined as a process as in Martin et al. (2007) and as exposed in chapter 2.7 (Theoretical Framework ). Investor engagement involves ongoing communication between investors and the company and is subdivided into ordinary course of business (in 2.71) and extra -ordinary course of business (activism) (in 2.7.2 ). Actions which are considered ordinary course of business considered in the analysis were: 1) Meetings with management (propos ition #17) and 2) Voting in ordinary and extra -ordinary shareholder meetings (proposition #1 8). Extra -ordinary course of bus iness or activis m comprises the following actions: escalating confrontation (proposition #1 9), exit and the threat of exit (proposition# 20), investor coalition and collaboration (proposition # 21) and shareholder proposals (proposition #2 2). See table 2-7 for a schematic presentation and the authors used as reference for each action. Thus, i nvestors were not considered activists when they plainly stated they were not or when they described themselves as not wanting to change anything in the companies they invested . The explanation as to why they were not activists or did not approve activism was based on con tent of the discourse.

Structural codes are concept -based related to the topics of research investigation and theory. Simultaneous coding was applied to sections of the text that were related to more than one topic (Saldanha, 2009). Subsequently, codes were grouped into themes that were the focus of the analysis. Themes derive from theory and the object of analysis. They are the “whats” of the analysis . The “hows” are embedded in the interpretations.", "The two qu otes below exemplify how coding was done in Atlas.ti . In the first quote, t he first order code was Exit , because the investor was talking about his response to when he identified something in the company he did not agree with “ If I don’t agree I will sell (…) the advantage of having a liquid portfolio is that I can sell to stock on the following day , and will put my effort in something I am more aligned with , that’s it” ( 5:5 ¶ 20 in A05) and (5:12 ¶ 32 in A05) . Exit, in turn is considered an “activist” acti on. Thus, this code was grouped under the “activism” theme.

If what is produced in interviews is a description of reality and not reality itself, it denies the interview content of saying anything about reality. One counter argument to this criticism is that there is no other way of accessing this content other than that which is made available by the participants of the interview. Another counter argument is that it is possible to combine form (how) and content (what). Gubrium and Holstein (2003) are proponents of thi s view. In what they call an “active interview” they say that “meaningful reality is constituted at the nexus of the ‘hows’ and the ‘whats’ of experience, by way of interpretative practice – the procedures and resources used to apprehend, organize, and rep resent reality (Gubrium and Holstein, 2003 pg . 73). But according to Silverman (2006), this counter argument leads them to inconsistency because “what” questions are the realm of positivists and emotionalists. He questions whether using interviews to answe r such questions will not take us back to earlier positions. Although important and complex this is an unresolved issue. So, constructivism is either narrow or inconsistent. Constructionism is not typically claimed in business or even organizational studie s. It is used in fields of social psychology, education, life studies and interactional linguistics. Thus, there is a lack of references when one wants to apply them to a different field. The challenge of employing it to a business studies context is one o f execution. The pitfall is that it might not meet the standards of any field.", "Qualitative analysis does not lend itself to generalizations. As put by Yin (2009), in reference to case method studies , they allow analytical generalizations. Another limitati on is that one cannot consider interviewees to be representatives of their investor group . Candidate selection does not obey survey method stratification criteria and there is no assurance that interviewees are “typical” of their categories. At most one ca n affirm that the accounts and descriptions they profess are part of the plethora of accounts that might be out there. And while all interviewees were designated by their institu tions to speak for the purpose of this research, their views might not entirel y coincide with that of other employees particularly where opinions on certain issues are still under discussion . In", "addition, perceptions are exposed by individuals who differ in ranks, activities, and experience.

When companies take actions they dislike, they will talk to the company but if it does not accommodate their concerns exit, rather than fighting, is the preferred route. However, if the posit ions in their portfolios are significant and they understand their shareholders will lose, they will fight for their rights. To them activism is a defense mechanism. Having to defend their rights is not new because some veteran institutions initiated their histories as activists defending their rights and trying to convince controlling shareholders of the benefits of good governance.

Only one fund was quite adamant in stating they were not value -investor s, they did not have the typical “outlet complex” of buying things that did not fit just because they were cheap (8:1 ¶14 in A8 – table 5-3). And yet, despite this positioning, it would be a stretch to interpret their liability structure equal to that of pension funds with captive long -term funding. These asset managers still publish fund share prices daily and while they may not have to provide next -day funds for redemptions, we preferred to continue to classify them as “short -term”.

In the late 90s, particularly between 1999 and 2001s, the period described by one of them as the “dark ages” of the Brazilian capital markets, activism meant survival. They had to practice a n “ativismo, ativista ”: visit the company with a copy of the Corporate Law “under the arm”, “request the install ation of a fiscal council” . This was because in earlier decades companies had gone public solely for gaining “fiscal benefits”. Many were family -controlled companies with no knowledge of governance, valuation or investors, and no notion as to why they had gone public20. Those were hard times for investors also because of macro - economic factors: recent currency stabilization, macro instability, sharp fluctuations in the exchange rates, low liquidity and a securities law that did not adequately protect minorit y shareholders. One described the period as a chicken and egg situation: company shares were undervalued because shareholders had no rights, but no rights meant shares would continue to be cheap. They would buy preferred shares (with not voting rights) and try to convince controlling shareholders that better rights and governance would bring about a lower cost of capital. It was a trial -and-error game to find out who was or not receptive. They encountered both open and closed doors. But all -in-all one inve stor expressed his frustration with the energy spent on activism:", "“Then it’s like this, the recollection we accumulated from this experience, was this, ‘wow, how much energy we spent to have access to exceptional businesses. In the end investments were su ccessful, but as we see it today, the reason why they were successful, is much more because of the fact the price was right and the business was very good, than because of the fact we were activists.”21.", "Three factors facilitated a change in the capital markets environment: 1) the reform of the corporate law in 2001; 2) the creation of the N ovo Mercado voluntary governance segments by the stock exchange in 2000 and 3) the flagship IPO of the personal care products producer Natura in 2004. Better rules wer e in place, but this issuance made it concrete to controlling shareholders there was value to gain with better governance :", "20 “não tinha nem noção de por que tinham aberto o capital” 21 Então assim, memória que a gente acumulou dessa experiência toda, foi assim, ‘poxa, quanta energia para ter acesso a esses negócios excepcionais’. No final os investimentos foram bem -sucedidos, mas na nossa ótica atual, a razão pra eles terem sido bem -sucedidos, é ela está muito mais no fato de que o preço era adequado e o negócio era muito bom, do que no fato de que nós fomos ativistas”", "“So then, in fact, you created a neat sample, and we said ‘guys, this business of corporate law, it's good, everybody wins, the compa nies gain liquidity, in the market’, and we went in in that (…) and there was also the coincidence those were good years for Brazil, right?”22.", "It became possible for these investors to change their behavior. Instead of a “formal” presence with board seats and lawyers, investors took on a more “natural” ongoing relationship with investees. “So, instead of a formal presence where you need to have a seat in the board, in order to try to change the way the company behaves, be close to controlling shareholders to force them to do something”23, they were able to focus on seeking quality investment opportunities. Many companies that went public after these regulatory changes had a different mindset and were open to ongoing dialogue with investors, “in these more mo dern companies, voice is a more natural thing, it is not something that needs to be imposed or that we need to hire lawyers to have it ”24.", "The Brazilian capital markets evolved substantially making it possible for foreign investors to come in and the inves tment industry to grow, “since then, I think the Brazilian market has evolved a lot, we really became open to receive investments from abroad, and today there is a large quantity of companies, funds and managers, competent people.”25. Thus, those activist funds managers fell - back to their vocation: identifying quality and correctly priced investment opportunities. Despite implementing regulation along the lines of OECD recommendations, the Brazilian capital market retains one main feature: it is primarily made up by companies who have clearly defined controlling shareholders holding a substantial portion of the company’s capital (De La Cruz, Medina and Tang, 2019). Many companies remain controlled by families or other institutions (the state, multinationals) not changing the nature of Brazilian capitalism which remains predominantly hierarchical (Schneider, 2009). In addition, problems associated with common law – weak enforcement – continue to prevail (La Porta et al., 1999 ; Black, 1999, Marti n et al. , 2007) . Under these conditions, as we will observe in practitioner perspectives, activism is low.", "22 “Então ali você criou, de fato, uma amostragem bacana, e a gente falou assim, ‘cara, esse negócio de regra societária legal, é bom, assim todo mundo ganha, as empresas ganaham na liquidez, no mercado’ e a gente entrou naquele... também houve naquela conincidência dos anos bons do Brasil, né?” 23 “E a presença, então, deixa de ser uma presença formal, em que você tenta ter um assento no conselho pra mudar a forma com que a empresa se comporta, e está muito proximo dos c ontroladores pra força -los a fazer alguma coisa” .", "24 “nessas empresas mais modernas, essa voz é uma coisa natural, ela não é uma coisa que precisa ser imposta ou que a gente precisa ter um... que a gente precisa contratar advogados pra ter, vamos dizer assi m.” 25 “e desde então, eu acho que o mercado de capital no Brasil se desenvolveu muito, a gente realmente ficou aberto pra receber recursos de fora, e hoje você tem aí uma quantidade de empresas, de fundos, de gestores bastante grande, gente competente”", "5.3.2 Activism", "5.3.2.1 Activism has a negative connotation.", "In the academy the term “activism” refer s to a body of literature dealing with the relationship between investors and companies. It carries a neutral connotation. For practitioners, however, activism means confrontation, belligerence, and opportunistic behavior. This negative connotation arises f rom the recent US experience (3:61 ¶114 in A3 -table 5 -4), but also from some Brazilian cases that failed (5:36¶84 /A5:39 ¶ 88 in A5 – table 5 -4). In addition, moral or marketing pressure takes its toll when fund managers become activists without being total ly prepared for comprehensive analysis of the situation and end up causing more harm than good to companies – “So, it’s like this, when we are invested in a listed company and a private equity buys into the stock, for us a red light turns on, what is this guy going to do?”26.", "5.3.2.2 Investors are adamant in saying they are not activists!", "Considering “shareholder activism” as “actions taken by shareholders with the explicit intention of influencing corporations’ policies and practices,” (Goronova and Ryan, 2014, pg.1232), these asset managers are clearly not activists. Directly or indirectly, they state their non -activist standing. They prefer companies they can admire or learn from management (1:40 ¶ 6 in A1 –table 5-6). They do not make investments hoping to change some things or the entire management (4:5¶14 in A4/6:26 ¶ 40 in A06 – table 5 -5). In fact, if they think something needs to change in a company, they should not invest at all (5:65 ¶245 in A5 - table 5 -5). The ir liability structure and size does not support the cost of activism , nor do they become activists just because using governance filters for investment is part of the investment philosophy (9:13¶40 in A9/ 2:45¶270 in A2 – table 5-5). This non-activist standing is recognized by A MEC in the introduction of their Ste wardship Code27. 5.3.2.3 Activism requires spending scarce resources, distorts focus and is ineffective. The rationale as to why they are not activists varied. There was a wide range of reasons: size (too small as in 7:9¶29 in A7 -table 5 -5), costs/time (as in 9:39 ¶307 in A9 -table 5 -6), distortion of the investment focus, not knowing more than management and culture.

Man, do you know when the result of this thing came out? Who knows, eight or nine years after.

Assim tá melhorando mas leva tempo as coisas acontecerem mesmo” .", "The overwhelming reason for activism making little sense in Brazil is that most companies have defined majority controlling shareholders. Fighting against a con trolling shareholder is “unjust” and “ungrateful” (1:134 ¶ 6 in A1 - table 5 -8) even if you are a large shareholder. Uniting forces is a possibility but difficult because of different agendas. Many controlling shareholders still find minority shareholders a nuisance (6:38 ¶ 74 in A06 -table5 -8) and the most that can happen is a minority shareholder voting against (5:6 ¶ 20 in A05 - table 5 -8) or making some noise in meetings (2:41 ¶ 257 in A02 -table -8). Thus, activism is not seen as a force to transform busin esses (10:13 ¶ 42 in A10 – table 5 -8).", "5.3.2.4 Activism is a defense mechanism .", "While not considering themselves activists, they showed no hesitation to act if fund share holder interests were being harmed, if they saw distortions, and the size of their holdings justified it. They are happy that defense tools are in place if they need th em31. Because some veteran players started out as activists and some large players have been practic ing activism there is experience in the market to act. Thus, these investors are ne ither passive nor blindly loyal. When holdings are large, rights are not being respected or investees are being mismanaged, they will act. Thus, p erceptions are consistent with the view that when private cooperation fails, one may move on to public methods of escalating belligerence (Gantchev, 2013). But also because of this attitude they are better placed in the category of “reactive engagement” (Çelik and Isaksson , 2013) behaving in line with theoretical expectations for mutual fund behavior (Gilson and Gordon, 2013). If the ultimate expected gain from shareholder activism is attenuation of principal -agent problems due to absent owners (Gillan et al. , 2007), ownership con centration leads to less financial activism because it reduces the possibility of this conflict for large investors (Judge et al. , 2010; Punsuvo et al. , 2007; Shleifer et al. , 1997). However, in a context of principal -principal conflict and large control s takes, activism might not payoff. Since most companies have majority shareholders, trying to chang e may easily become a fight one is bound to lose even if one is a large minority shareholder (Duarte, 2021) . Engag ement needs to be sensitive and tactful in a culture that is affective, does not like confrontation (Meyer, 2015) and o wners find it hard to listen to an outsider who has ideas about how to run the business . Engagement with controlled companies needs to be well thought and carried out, for emotions not to cause the loss of objectiveness.

(2017) . For a large fund, becoming an activist is inevitable ( 4:9 ¶ 14 in A04 – table 5 - 10). It is a matter of taking the lead and making sure the company has a proper board in place. Companies without controlling shareholders are prone to the class ic agency problem (Jensen and Meckling, 1976) .

For these investors, their first choice is neither one of the traditional “voice, loyalty or exit” (Hirshman, 1970), but of non -entry (table 5-14). IAs exercise extreme scrutiny prior to commitment. This is applied to business fundamentals (such as predictability of returns), quality of management (e.g., internal controls).

Many companies are in commodity businesses where margins and returns are less predictable while investors seek companies with more predictable and high er returns on capital. It is clear asset managers focus on substance rather than form (table 5 -18). Differentiated governance trading segments at the stock exchange may imply better minority shareholder rights but the labels alone do not sustain credibility and they verify whether the company means what it preaches. Equally, there is no preconceived opinion as to whether defined control companies are inherently bette r or wors e than “corporations” and there is no prejudice in investing in preferred shares (no voting rights).", "This crafted and subjective evaluation contrasts with the standardized approach foreign investors make when using proxy solicitation firms to guide their vote.

Open communication channels are fundamental ( table 5 -19). The entry point is usually the company’s investor relation s (IR) department where most of the data is gathered, analyzed, and clarified. However, IR departments are seen as compliance areas devoting much time to fulfilling the mandatory disclosure requirements (2:60 ¶411 in A2), who produce the “standard” discours es and are not necessarily the most experienced and knowledgeable about the company (7:13 ¶31 in A7).

Secondly, the relationship may bias assessment and make timely disinvestment difficult ( 10:30 ¶ 92 in A10 – table 5 -21).

Specifically, the characterization of Brazilian society as “relational”, frequently mentioned in the works of celebrated anthropologists, Roberto da Matta and Livia Barbosa such as “A Casa e a Rua” (199 7) and “Igualdade e Meritocracia” (200 3), could be at play to explain the relevance of personal networks and the importance of the soft information obtained from people they know (and trust) personally. This may be an indication that Brazil’s capital mark et is low on contractual trust, a precondition for efficient capital markets (Martin et al. , 2007). So, investors rely on people they know to join forces to elect board members and to obtain soft information that cannot be transmitted in standard disclosu re materials or by institutionalized information channels (table 5 -22).

First, they can achieve greater depth and press management to discuss sensitive matters without exposing the company. Second, knowing what and how to ask is quality differentiator skill that gives them a competitive edge (6:74 ¶ 86 in A06 – table 5 -23). Th e third reason is a consequence of the second: other asset managers are competitors and do not want their questions to reveal insights and concerns (1:120 ¶ 27 in A01 – table 5 -23). If possible, they would want the opportunities to remain hidden for a good amount of time. Group meetings were thought to be fine when the purpose was getting to know the business and get a sense of management (5:30 ¶ 72 in A05 – table 5 -23). As stated, private meetings generate private information but not, necessarily, material non- public information.

Insider information was also a concern when a lot of it was obtained via personal relationships and non -institutional company sources (4:34 ¶ 110 in A04 – table 5 -23).

Most will participate when there is a topic of interest (5:49 ¶ 133 in A05 -X-24) or their participation is important (1:51 ¶ 29 in A01 -table 5 -24) – usually companies without controlling shareholders need a large enough turn -out to meet the minimum installation quorum. Smaller funds are very conscious that their stakes make no difference in the voting outcome (7:23 ¶ 71 in A07 table 5 -24) and are a “mere formality” (1:53 ¶ 29 in A01 – table 5 -24) in companie s with majority shareholders.

There is a learning curve to be climbed so that their participation is effective and well received (3:24 ¶ 6 in A03 – table 5 -25).

To that end, important information sources have become available. Knowing who are the other shareholders via Bloomberg services and/or by requesting the shareholder list to companies36 has become commonplace and companies more responsive to provide them. Also, investors knowing each other, knowing who usually has enough votes to team up with and the ability to communicate with each other enable collaboration (4:20 ¶ 48 in A04 – table 5 -26). The statements by several asset managers indicate they all have participated and sometimes initiated collaborative efforts. One even stated that that joining up votes was “not activism” but a “crowdfunding” for votes and it was “good” (5:55 ¶ 146 in A05 – table 5 -26)!

But the concern goes beyond that of legal restrictions: participating in boards may jeopar dize independent thinking and bias decision making (10:33 ¶ 92 in A10 – table 5 -27). Indicating members to the board of directors is also regarded as exceptional but may happen in cases in which the company has specific needs and collaboration among investors has enabled minority shareholders to elect appointees (3:48 ¶ 76 in A03 – table 5 -27).

These investors reject the label of activists because it is negatively perceived. They view activis m to distort focus, spend scarce resources and have little chance of success when dealing with majority -controlled companies. While they are not “activists” or at most “reactive activists” they can be considered active engagers since they follow companies closely and establish collaborative and close relationships with companies where exchanges are well received and mutually beneficial. In these relationships which they cultivate with care, they to put forward their views and suggest changes. When the compa ny is not sensitive to their concerns they prefer to exit instead of any other escalation. However, they will fight if their positions are substantial, and they believe their shareholders will be harmed. Since voting is not obligatory and seen a mere forma lity, they will participate in meetings when there is a matter of interest or when it benefits their relationship with the company.", "These perspectives are consistent with the theory that ownership concentration subdues activism (Schleifer and Vishny, 1997; La Porta et al. ,1999) . They are also consistent with theories that argue that diversification and performance metrics (Gilson and Gordon, 2013), profit -seeking and short -term liability structure are prone to less activism (Celik and Ikabosson, 2013; Ryan and Schneider, 2002). They corroborate with the view that investor size enables investors to wage activism (Ryan and Schneider, 2002; Rubach and Sebora ,2009) and mutual funds are the least active of Brazilian investors (Maranho et al. 2020). They also corr oborate with the view that activism in Brazil is still low but increasing (Vargas et al. , 2017).", "In terms of ownership conception, independent asset managers perspectives are compatible with that of “legal owners” as in McNulty and Nordberg’s (2016) path ( a); “traders” (Hendry et al. , 2006), and “profit and utility maximizers” (Berle and Means, 1991; Jensen and Meckling, 1976).

To the extent Brazilian public ly traded companies remain held by majority owners, resource allocation will remain the prerogative of controlling shareholders and how good a job they do will depend on the level of competition in the markets, the disruptive power of new technologies and the pressur e environmental changes may exercise. If politics plays a role in the level of competition in markets (Roe, 2008), it will also impact the quality and the speed of change.", "The external monitoring minority investors may exercise is likely not be strong enough to promote the correction of deviations. Independent asset managers with long -term focus may, through their ongoing relationship with investees, help only those companies in which they are successful in their convincing efforts. Acting only when th ey need to defend their rights and avoiding problematic companies are mechanisms that enable their survival but do little to cause corrections . The implications for normative proponents – such as the O ECD best practices and stewardship promoters – is that while efforts may need to continue because they contribute to enhance investor understanding of responsibilities ( Yamahaki and Fyrnas , 2016) and provide yardsticks for governments and investors as to how to orient their practices, actual change is slow and uncertain. For regulators, the implication is that regulation needs to improve to make the proxy voting process cheaper, easier to access and more transparent. This is also important for academic studie s on activism since voting outcomes, requests for cumulative votes and the presentation of alternative names in board or fiscal board elections are measurable indicators for activism.

This is due to size but also their disclosure standards may line-up with compliance requirements of the Central Bank and of publicly - traded companies. Thus, they provi de comprehensive disclosure of their policies and practices in their websites. In addition to the “ formulário de referência ”, they disclose their ethics and conduct codes; order allocation, risk management and employee personal investment policies; and compliance practices, for example.

Typically funds that are offered to the retail base are flat fee and short -term, however they also manag e tailor -made funds which may have other fee and liability structures. The same is true for diversification and investment strategies. They may offer single share funds with zero diversification, indexed and active funds.

Judging from the spotlight ESG is given in their websites39, they all make sustainable investment a big piece of their communication and, may include it in product offerings – e.g., BTGPactual Investimentos de Impacto, BB Ações Sustentabilidade. So ESG commitment is important for the or ganization’s legitimization which means they are subject to coercive isomorphism (Dimaggio and Powel, 1983). However, membership of PRI is also a way to deal with uncertainty since they will have guidelines, standards, and support, to handle issues that ar e relatively new to the investment field, so, here, mimetic isomorphism is also at play (Dimaggio and Furthermore, partaking in these initiatives (such as PRI) goes beyond signing a piece of paper.

The end -result is that institutions look alike in their discourse, their processes, and approaches to issues (isomorphism).", "In addition to all information provided freely, PRI signato ries can participate in groups to discuss themes, sectors, and indicators. This supports professionals in their understanding of issues and complexities, in establishing priorities and exchanging experiences. Periodically PRI identifies the sectors of focu s for discussion. Once that is done, they produce a letter, signed by all participants, with which they will meet with companies to express their concerns, the importance of the themes and solicit information and action. Institutions vary in how they parti cipate in these activities. Some appreciate it because they think it produces a stronger front, “Then, we think there is more weight, because you are taking a group of investors that are interested in that theme, and then if anyone has any specific issue, they can treat it separately”40; others participate with less enthusiasm: “but despite", "preocupação que eu tenho observado assim, não só aqui, mas nas gestoras em geral, é de ter essa preocupação de ter uma postura um pouco mais pos itiva do que de ser ativista e ter demandas muito específicas que (…) (1:18 ¶ 42 in C1).", "39 See BBDTVM, Itau Asset, Bradesco Asset, BTGPactual Asset, Vinci Partners and Santander Asset websites . 40 “Então a gente entende que tem um peso maior, porque você t á levando ali uma... um grupo de investidores que têm interesse naquele tema, e aí eventualmente se tiver uma coisa específica, cada um trata separadamente.” (1:33 ¶ 80 in", "that we also participate – to a lesser extent – in what we call group engagements, right?

This form of approach enables investors to bring up new or difficult issues with companies using the PRI front while their own organization’s participation is diluted. For large publicly traded organizations, themselves easy targets of activism (Goronova and Ryan, 2002), this kind of protection may enable them to advance discussions they might otherw ise be reluctant to start if pursued alone. Amec is another institution that has been active in the defense of minority shareholders, “Obviously, we believe a lot in the work they are doing, right? In the past few years, it has been very good in protecting minority shareholders, right?” 43. Amec can also express views without exposing its members but has also been instrumental in promoting discussion about issues that concern minority shareholders. In its Stewardship Code it proposes that the “ role of instit utional investor s cannot be detached from the fiduciary duty they accept when managing resources on behalf of individuals” 44. As PRI, Amec urges investors to be “active” rather than “activists” and state that not being “activist” does not mean being passiv e about fiduciary duties.

This creates potential conflicts of interests in exercising their fiduciary obligations (Brickley, Leash and Smith, 1988). Therefore, they would be less willing to vote against man agement. The question was put to NIAs, at first indirectly. This did not elicit any answers, so the question was put directly, and as expected NIAs response to this issue was along the lines of the separate legal entity, internal controls, and compliance. As separate legal entities they had the autonomy to make their decisions irrespective of the company in question. “Chinese walls”45 were in place preventing the asset management company to have access to confidential information from the bank and vice -versa. To ensure that rules are followed, they had compliance areas, internal controls and auditing that monitors, tapes phone calls, t racks access and contacts to prevent conflicted actions. However, one NIA indicated they had to be careful with the possibility of conflicting views on voting direction on the funds they manage for third parties46. So, perhaps the relevant potential for con flict of interest might not be between the asset management and the banking or insurance arms of the business but among the interests of the asset management clients themselves. Indeed, Davis and Ham Kim (2005) and Asharf and Ryan (2012) suggest withing fi rm conflict of interest in their findings that fund families are less likely to vote against management when there are more business ties to portfolio companies .", "6.3.2 Investment Process", "6.3.2.1 Two -pronged standardized investment processes: fundamental and ESG analysi s NIAs conduct two parallel processes of investment analysis.

There are several elements that would point to a lower propensity for activism: diversification, profit -seeking, and short -term liability structure (Gilson and Gordon, 2013; Celik and Ikabosson, 2013; Ryan and Schneider, 2002). But these are not the only ones. They also must manage fund object ives and client instructions when it comes to deciding vote orientation. In terms ownership conception, NIAs perspectives are compatible with that of “legal owners” as in McNulty and Nordberg’s (2016) path (a); “traders” (Hendry, 2006), and “profit and utility maximizers” (Berle and Means, 1991; Jensen and Meckling, 1976).

Therefore, engagement might be the route to manage the asset risk the face across several portfolios.", "NIAs have another challenge yet. Many are the investment arms of large publicly traded financial institutions, themselves favorite targets of activism and the media. Whichever way they choose to go it will have to be consistent with the regulation entities of the group are subjected to and the image and reputation objective of the conglomerate. So, it is likely that NIAs chose what is safe and good for their image. They seek external symbols and adopt standards that have international recognition such as the PRI and join in to support through membership and participation entities like Amec. These institutions not only provide them with yardsticks to align their conduct but lend their fronts to engagement actions or to voice minority sh areholders’ concerns. These movements pave the way for NIAs own individual engagement actions in the sense that when they happen, they will not be the only or first voice to be heard.", "Their commitment is genuine and has substance. They hire dedicated an d qualified teams, their employees participate in specialized discussions groups, write papers and reports, tackle the difficult task of integrating ESG into valuation models and portfolio orientation, and engage companies, making well -intended efforts to bring them on board.

However, they indicate that the regulator needs to act to improved disclosure on ESG and on transparency overall. While they have access to com panies , they do no t develop close relationships and favor a more institutionalized form s of relationship.", "Their perspectives also evidence that evaluating the effectiveness investor monitoring will remain difficult because both IAs and NIAs prefer private meetings with comp anies. This is consistent with McCahery, Sautner, and Starks ’s (2016) survey where they found investors preferred “behind - the-scenes” discussions with management and board members to overt voice channels . Thus, it reenforces the view that external indicato rs of activism might not reveal all of what goes on between investors and companies.", "A final point is that while integrating environmental and social risks and opportunities is important to evaluate current and future (pre) financial risks of a company, “traditional” governance quality and financial performance aspects seem to get diluted as if they lost relevance or were not fundamentally important to the company’s ability to do better in environmental and social issues. In terms of future studies one aspect that might be better elucidated is the nature and types of conflict -of-interest B razilian asset management companies may face . Both Brickley et al.

While the re migh t not be sufficient information to conduct similar studies in Brazil, it may be possible to qualitatively map out if such conflicts exist, their nature, magnitudes and how they are delt with . Do Brazilian banks have such critical lending exposures to compa nies? Is it a relevant conflict of interest? What are within asset management conflict of interests? Are compliance rules capable of avoiding them? Brazilian banks were never exposed to a “Glass Steagall Act, thus they have formed broader conglomerates than US banks have ever dreamed of. What conflict of interests might this create? Another area that might be explored in an article is a thorough understanding of the voting process .

Also, some large defined benefit plans are already net payers of pensions with higher liquidity needs so that being ti ed-up in long -term shareholder agreements is no longer as advantage ous because they have less control over the appropriate selling moment. They are comfortable in describing their actions as activism, but those differ according to investment strategy. In outsourced funds, they act as inducer of better practices requiring asset managers to become more formal, accountable and ESG minded. When they are insiders, they have better command and can appoint boards.

The other important feature that has not changed in essence is the predominance of public pensi on", "62 OECD Pension Fund in Figures June 2020 - https://www.oecd.org/pensions/private -pensions/Pension - Funds -in-Figur es-2020.pdf", "funds which account for 62.0% of AUM while private pension funds make up for most of the rest – 37.0% (Abrapp – Dez 2020 ). However, one must highlight a major difference between “public” pension funds in Brazil and in the US. In the US, “public” pension funds are those who belong to civil servants of the states. Those benefits are legal liabilities and as such are backed by state taxing power, so bankruptcy is not a serious possibility (Romano, 1993). In Brazil, the largest public pension funds belong to publicly traded companies that are controlled by the state like Petrobras and Banco do Brasil or those who are fully owned by the state or are government entities, e.g., Caixa Economica Federal, BNDES, and Banco Central. These entities provide retirement plans under capitalization systems63. While defined contribution plans are the largest in quantity - 41.7% of the total they only account for 13.1% of AUM. They are followed by variable contribution (CV) plans – 37.0% of the total and 25.5% of AUM. Lastly, defined benefit (DB) plans represent only 27.6% of the quantity of funds but have the lions’ share of AUM (61.4%) (Previc – Informe Estatístico – 4th Quarter 2020)64. DB plans have fallen out of favor because of their risk characteristics and many pension funds have stopped offering them at all. Gradually, the AUM share of DB plans should also decline as some large pension funds stated they have already reached the pe ak and are net payers of pensions. Shifting from DB to DC and CV plans is one means to reduce the possibility that pension funds suffer political pressure, however they also reduce incentives for activism because of more outsourcing (Romano, 1993).", "Distri bution of pension fund money is very unequal. The ten largest pension funds hold 57.9% of AUM (Previc – Informe Estatístico – 4th Quarter 2020) but the country’s largest pension fund alone has 22.5% of the total. The next largest is half its size and almos t twice as large as the third. The three largest pension funds are public and together manage 41.2% of the total AUM.

Being part of control blocks tied together by shareholder agreements was the way to go to protect their interests, at a time where minority shareholder protection was w eak. As insiders they were able to monitor and contribute to the development of those companies and the strategies they were to follow. The idea that a large participation in a control block could function as a substitute for quality governance was suggest ed by Punsuvo et al. (2006).", "To be effective, however, shareholder agreements need stability which means tying parties together for the long -term. They will impose conditions – such as preemptive rights – should a party decide to sell its stake. This may l imit the pension fund’s liquidity strategy.

If they have reached the point at which they are substantial or net payers of pensions they must hold shorter term fixed income instruments.

Also, in these plans employees can choose how to allocate thei r money by asset class, so, mobility and portability, calls for investments in more liquid stocks, such as those that are part of indices (IBX -100) and controlling shareholder positions are no longer suitable. The fact that the Brazilian stock exchange is more diversified contributes to enable this kind of strategy.

In part this because large public pension funds were insiders when they p articipated in controlled blocks of privatized companies and in part because some large pension funds belonged to privatized companies who took and more passive role.", "While the overall size as a percentage of GDP and main features of the Brazilian pension fund industry are the same, some micro features are leading to change. The most important one is the growth in the number of defined contribution (or CV plans) which require more liquidity. Another change is that as people age, defined benefit plans, most of which have been closed to new entrants, start paying out more pensions and will also need more liquidity. Thus, shareholder agreements with requirements that restrict the freedom of the pension fund to develop its liquidity strategy may no longer be int eresting. In fact, some high -profile shareholder agreements that made pension funds party to controlling blocks of privatized companies, no longer exist. The underlying companies were either sold or taken private or the shareholder agreement was dismantled . So, the role of public pension funds as insiders is diminishing.", "Pension fund activism evolves on three fronts: 1) inducing asset managers to whom the outsource their business towards greater formalization, accountability and responsible investment", "85 “Nós ainda não participamos de nenhuma delas, a gente ainda não indicou diretamente nenhuma.

Measuring the effectiveness in the first two fronts will be difficult but as voting information improves it will be possible to observe how they vote how successful they are in promoting their board member candidates and if those candidates help company performance or protect the interests of minorit y shareholders.

They are not compatible with the notions of “psychological” owners in McNulty and Nordberg’s (2016) path (b) nor “universal” owners (Hawley and Williams, 2000, 200 7).

How many are still in place? How significant are they? Can pension funds still be characterized as “controlling shareholders”? Can those participations sustain the argument developed in Lazzarini ( 2010) that the state maintained its grip in privatized companies through state -owned company pension funds? Depending on the answers to these questions, we may find that pension funds are inaugurating a new era of participation and their success as “activi sts” might be measured by the governance and performance quality of companies their votes or efforts were successful in electing board members.", "Another issue, also associated with the fact that their participation in controlling block diminished, that mig ht be explored is what types of political pressure can governments still exert over public pension funds?

One adaptation we made relates to the institutional environment. Since the Brazilian regulator requires all funds to publish quota prices daily, IAs were classified as “short -term” oriented despite most of them saying that they were long term investors. According to the model, a n “active fundamental” investment strategy would imply “alpha engagement” but IAs stated activism was a defensive me chanism thereby , a reactive attitude . Thus , we classified them as reactive engagers.", "Another issue relates to the unit of analysis. The model proposes four fund strategies . To the extent the institutional invest or only manages funds with one or similar strateg ies, as is the case of most IAs interviewed , fund and institution strategies may be considered the same. However, our unit of analysis is the institutional investor company and n ot the fund. Both NIAs manage several funds with different strategies and p ension funds apply several strategies to different portions of their portfolio. Thus, it is not possible to classify the institutional investor in terms of investment strategy. The same is true to portfolio and fee structure . NIAs, for example, may offer highly concentrated single share funds as well as highly diversified balanced funds . And yet, the invest ment companies ’ risk analysis , and thereb y, ESG engagement efforts and voting guidance are company rather than portfolio strategy related. NIAs , for example, when evaluating ESG risk do so based of investee merits . Company risk may impact its weight in active but not on indexed and single share p ortfolios. Thus, fund investment strategy might not be a good indicator of engagement expectations when dealing with large investment management companies or pension funds.", "Pension funds are an equal ly diverse group and may use several engagement strategies for parts of their portfolio .

Furthermore, t o the extent that observing investor “actions” is realized by noting their behavior in the proxy solicitation process, observations will not be substantial in Brazil because, as in the UK, voting is not obligatory and it is unlikely that voting turnouts will ever be as significant as in the US even if the reasons which disincentivize votes in the Brazilian environment, were to be eliminated .", "8.2 Ownership concepts", "Discourses and fund characteristics were also evaluated in terms of the ownership concepts underlying investor perspectives and the best fit seems to be that of legal owners who view their obligations with the investee firm in terms of a set of rights and obligations, as “active owners” in McNulty and Nordberg’s (2016) path a, investors (proposition #4).

Asset managers (i ndependen t or not) perceive “activism” to involve confrontation , so the term has a negative connotation which they associate with aggressive hedge fund activism in the US , cases of Brazilian private equities who took over publicly traded compani es with as “disastrous ” outcome and of investors who got together to extract value from companies and make changes which were not in the company’s best interests. They also reject the label , state they are not activists and that they want to be seen a s “collaborative , activists” .

In relation to the secondary question “what may prompt them to act ”, independent assets stated they would escalate if they thought their interests were not being respected and their positions in the company were important for their portfolios . In fact , some independent asset s managers and pension funds interviewed for this study were involved in investor -company disputes that gained the media .

On the contrary, they are active engagers in the sense they meet the company regularly and follow it closely . Independent assets avoid getting into poor governance situations where they may face the choice of exiting or fighting so, prior to entry , they are careful scruti nizers of their investees doing th orough work on governance and business aspects and developing close relationships with management where they can keep track and adjust expectations accordingly. Except for state -owned companies , rejected by some for their lower earnings predictability (governance and commodity businesses), there are no other eliminatory criteria adopted by independent assets . They are willing to invest in preferred or voting shares , family -run, foreign -run, or dispersed capital companies when they are happy with the investment opportunity and the company’s governance . The latter is examined for its substance : who the board members are, what is the board ’s dynamics, its power structure and the controlling shareholders ’ reputation , history , and treatment of minority shareholders . So, access to management is a key governance preference . They appreciate companies that value their input and refer to this process as “collaborative activism”. Ongoing a ccess and proximity are important because it afford s them foresight: the opportunity to discuss strategy with management, make non -intrusive suggestions and lend opinions on matters of their expertise. The behavior they describe is compatible with that found in Holland, 1998, in his investigation of B ritish institutional investors. This means that the substance of activity between investor and investees happens here, as elsewhere , behind -the-scenes (McCahery et al. , 2016 ) producing little or no external signs whether discussions and negotiations were successf ul in convincing management to change policies and practices . Without external indicators it is hard to evaluate the effectiveness of activism and thereby the relevance of this group of investors as an external governance mechanism .", "Non-independen t assets and internally managed pension fund s’ portfolios are also active engagers.

It usually means adopting standards, procedures and making some form of public accountability. Thus, particularly NIAs share similarities in structures and approaches . All entities with different degrees of formalism and sophistication are trying to incorporate ESG concerns in their investment analysis. In addition, adopting these principles gives them access to standards and discussions with which they can support the ir internal decision -making processes, especially since large institutions require traceable decision -making procedures because of hierarchies and compliance.", "Committing to outside and international standards also legitimizes their actions.

Beyond these internal aspects supporting the stewardship message and ESG can be interpreted as a more general act “activist” practice directed to the market and governments where they point the direction where they want the market to go without individually fronting the activity.

As stated before , voting at general meetings is not mandatory in Brazil and turnouts are low. Although some independent assets vote regularly due to belief, relationship and even fiduciary reasons, most state they vote on a case -by-case basis, when the issue at hand is of their interest. All that can be said is that there is a growing consciousness with respect to voting by non- independent assets . Large public pension funds exert influence either because they are insiders or they have positions that are large enough to propose and vote-in a board representative , request a fiscal board or separate voting .", "Despite that , the notion of voting as a fiduciary duty is still incipient and stewardship proponents have a substantial task ahead of them to convince investors to vote when, at best, all their vote can do is create some noi se. Identifying the “economic” benefits of voting when considering that most companies have clearly defined controlling shareholders may not be easy to justify. Towards that end, streamlining the distance voting process, i.e., making the system less cumber some, easy to access and cheap , is fundamental and the authorities should work diligently in that direction. The perspectives exposed by Brazilian institutional investors in this study are consistent with the theory that ownership concentration subdues act ivism (Schleifer and Vishny, 1997; La Porta et al.,1999) . They are also consistent with theories that argue that diversification and performance metrics (Gilson and Gordon, 2013), profit -seeking and short -term liability structure are prone to less activism (Celik and Ikabosson, 2013; Ryan and Schneider, 2002). They corroborate with the view that investor size enables investors to wage activism (Ryan and Schneider, 2002; Rubach and Sebora ,", "2009) and that, mutual funds, are the least active of Brazilian inves tors (Maranho et al. , 2020). They also support the view that activism in Brazil is still low but increasing (Vargas et al. , 2017). However, investor perspectives permit us to see how practitioners make sense of their world, understand their limitations, e xpose their frustrations, and describe their actions. They are yet another source of data support ing the view that local investors remain weak as an external governance mechanism . Even if we conceiv e that these investor s may attempt and succeed in convinc ing companies to change their policies and practices by engaging private ly in the ordinary course of business , it will remain hard to measure the effectiveness of these efforts .", "Thus, it seems that the improvement in investor protection which has occurred in Brazil over the past 20 years did what it could to strengthen capital markets , which ha ve responded by proving to be a viable source of funding for controlled companies and to receive foreign investment . However, these changes have no t challenge d the prevailing hierarchical firm organization that characterizes the country as Hierarchical Market Economy (Schneider, 2009) and external mechanisms such as investor activism and the market for corporate control remain weak or inexistent. If the effectiveness of the corporate governance system depends on the complementarity of internal and external mechanisms, improvements in the legal framework alone may not suffice . Novo Mercado requirements such as independent (from the controlling share holder) board members help but still leave minority investors vu lnerable .", "This is an indication that chang es in the legal framework may be necessary but not sufficient to strengthen the country’s governance system . To that end, the view proposed by Roe (2008) which found support in Aminadav et al. , 2020, empirical work, that politics matters could be better explored in the Brazilian situation and in countries where defined control predominates. Other micro and macro measures – such as more freedom for Br azilian s to invest abroad (and thus , force Brazilian companies to compete for capital on a global basis ), higher disclosure standards for non -public traded companies (lowering the gap between private and public company disclosure) , better long-term retirement investing alternative s, lower interest rates , etc. could be explored as part of a package of measures intended to strengthening and making local capital markets core choice of firm financing. But this is a political – economic policy - decision which has not yet been made.", "Meaning making is situated and interviews for this study were conducted in 2018.

We defined activism as “actions taken by shareholders with the explicit intention of influencing corporations’ policies and practices” (Goronova and Ryan, 2014) . Engagement was defined as a process involving the ongoing interaction between the company and investors . It includes ordinary activities of the investor relations routine such as meetings with the company and voting and extraordinary actions which were considered acti vism (Martin et al. , 2007). Among these, we considered exit, escalation of the conflict, voting against management , collaboration among investors and shareholder proposals.", "Our main conclusion s are:", "1) Activism has a negative con notation because it is ass ociated with confrontation . Investors do not want to be seen as activists and prefer to call themselves “collaborative activists”. Only large public pension funds use the term to describe their actions. 2) Activism in Brazil is limited and primarily reactive : a defense mechanism to be used if rights or interests are perceived to have been harmed but to be avoided at all cost s through prior scrutiny of companies’ governance. C ollaboration is a practice which is recognized by all as having become more common but is neither frequent, regular or with the same parties.", "3) Pro-active activism is limited to and primarily associated with public pension funds proposing candidates to board seats, requesting separate elections for minority or preferred shareholders and fiscal boards . Independent asset managers do not believe activism as an effective means of inducing change i n companies most of which have clearly defined controlling shareholders with over half of the voting capital. They do not see it as their roles to take action to induce performance or governance improvement other than what might be achieved by convinc ing management in ordinary course of business in private meetings .", "4) Voting disclosure is improving among non -independent asset managers and large public pension funds. Consciousness of voting as a fiduciary duty is increasing among Stewardship signatories but accountability is incipient. Independent asset managers have", "voting policies in place and some practice i t regularly on beliefs, habit or for relationship reasons. But most vote on a case -by-case basis when there is a subject of interest. So, voting turnouts will remain low impacting the visibility and ability to measure investor activism.", "5) Investors, as an external governa nce mechanism, remain weak. Further more, the ongoing improvements in investor protection over the past 20 years have borne fruits but have not changed the fundamental characteristi c of ownership structure. Thus, to the extent that governance effectiveness depends on the complementar ity of internal and external mechanisms , the fact that key external mechanisms (e.g., competitive markets for capital, and investor pressure) , imply that the overall governance sy stem remains weak. Ownership concentration may subdue principal -agent problem , but principal -principal issues remain without satisfactory remedies , theoretical or practical . In terms of further research , we suggest areas that may be pursed where better understanding of the specifics of the Brazilian case may be better clarified. We suggest better understanding of topics that are commonly raised in studies of activism: votes, conflict s-of-interest, and political pressure on pension funds.", "One research project that might be pursued is a thorough description of the voting process taking into consideration the information that needs to be provided, aspects of the electronic voting system, documentation, and its costs, and very importantly how vo tes are counted. Similar studies have been undertaken in other jurisdictions (Eckbo, 2011 ). This is because clarity of votes is so important for the measurement of activism. Another aspect associated with the voting process relates to the voting of candida te slates rather than voting for individual candidates. What are the merits of each alternative? What can it mean to power balance and most importantly what does it mean to board effectiveness? Conventional discussion about board composition is based on di rector independence. But as the idea of diversity evolves it becomes evident that what is important is an effective team at the board. So rather than individuals , what may be desired are board members that have complementary competencies that are needed by the company. So, voting for a slate may serve the company better. This renders a good debate concerning governance quality.", "On a broader perspective, the nature, and types of conflict of interest that may occur within asset managers and between asset management companies who are part of financial conglomerates could be further explored because financial institutions in Brazil are far more diversified tha n in the United States.

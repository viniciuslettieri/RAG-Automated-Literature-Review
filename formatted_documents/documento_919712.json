Corn oil can be o btained from various conventional processing; nonetheless, it also can be generated as a by -product from corn - bioethanol manufacturing (VELJKOVIĆ; BIBERDŽIĆ; BANKOVIĆ -ILIĆ; DJALOVI Ć et al. , 2018) . This method is more profitable and innovative because the residual stillage coming from corn-based bioethanol making is harnessed to produce distillers corn oil (DCO). In Brazil, corn represents the third most -produced plant of the tota l agricultural output, and as a consequence, the country is characterized to be one of the best producers of corn -based bioethanol globally (AGÊNCIABRASIL, 2021; BARROS; WOODY, 2020) . Crude corn oil primary comprises TAGs, but other minor components such as monoglycerides (MAGs) , diglycerides (DAGs) and free fatty acids (FFAs ) may be formed during the oil extr action process (OSAWA; GONÇALVES; RAGAZZI, 2007) .", "Biodiesel is defined as fatty acids monoalkyl esters (FAME), and it is considered a sustainable alternative for petroleum -based fuels. Over the years, many countries have adopted biodiesel mixtures to supply commercial engines. In this scenario, Brazil belongs to the group of the largest bio diesel manufacturers around the world (JANAUN; ELLIS, 2010; SILVA; FERREIRA; MARQUES; MURTA et al. , 2017) . The primary reaction for biodiesel synthesis is the transesterification of TAGs with short -chain alcohols in the presence of alkaline catalysts. For this purpose, edible oils are considered the most appropriate TAGs source. To boost the profitability of bi odiesel , some researchers have focused on investigating alternative feedstock such as DCO (VELJKOVIĆ; BIBERDŽIĆ; BANKOVIĆ -ILIĆ; DJALOVIĆ et al. , 2018) . The main drawback of oily commodities employed in the alkali -catalyzed transesterification procedure is the presenc e of FFAs since they react with basic catalyst s to form soap. Soap is undesirable because it diminishes biodiesel quality and can not be easily removed. In order to reduce the FFAs existent in oily lesser -grade feedstock, some treatments could be applied, like the esterification using glycerol.", "This work studied the esterification reaction between FFAs present in DCO and glycerol as a pre -treatment for subsequent biodiesel production. The glycerol is a co -product of biodiesel", "manufacturing that, in recent years, it has turned into an issue for th e biodiesel market. Such a problem is due to the expansion in biodiesel factories, causing the drop in glycerol price. In most cases, crude glycerol purification is vital for forwarding use as a precursor of value -added chemicals. Nonetheless, the primary hitch is that glycerol refining is expensive for medium and small biodiesel producers (ABDUL RAMAN; TAN; BUTHIYAPPAN, 2019; VELUTURLA; ARCHNA; SUBBA RAO; HEZIL et al. , 2018) . The application of unrefined glycerol has become the main focus for investigators and biodiesel manufacturers, consideri ng its low market pricing. In this scenario, the present study shows a prospect of employing crude glycerol in -situ for pre - treating acid DCO and explore the opportunity of integration of both procedures .", "Even if the esterification of FFAs with glycerol is an exciting option to develop an optimal industrial chain, the reaction is characterized to be slow, requiring high temperatures and intensive speed agitation to improve the oily/glycerol phases (FERRETI; SPPOTTI; DI COSIMO, 2018) . Besides, it needs an effective metho d for removing water (vacuum, N 2 purging) and high glycerol/oil mass ratios to keep up the reaction in the right direct ion (MIĆIĆ; TOMIĆ; MARTINOVIĆ; KISS et al. , 2019) . The fact that reaction is suitable under up temperatures may lead to the oil darkening because of the degradation of oil components. Another drawback is the TAGs glycerolysis , that produces MAGs and DAGs. MAGs, DAGs and degradation products , also foster the generation of soap and are undesirable. One possible alternative to alleviate the strong reaction conditions may be the addition of catalysts.", "This research aims at evaluating all the possible industrial applications of the esterification between FFAs present in DCO and glycerol. For this proposal, the optimization of process parameters (temperature, glycerol/oil mass ratio and vacuu m) using pure glycerol was carried out throughout the response surface methodology. The kinetics and the application of crude glycerol and acid glycerol were also analyzed to explore the best options for using mild conditions and reducing industrial costs. The primary objective is to obtain a high er-grade DCO with low content of FFAs, high content of TAGs, and less degraded.", "2 SCOPE", "2.1 GENERAL SCOPE", "Reduce the free fatty acids in distillers corn oil for biodiesel production throughout esterification using glycerol.", "2.2 ESPECIFIC SCOPES", "- Evaluate the effect of temperature, vacuum , and glycerol/oil mass ratio and their interaction s in the esterification reaction. - Optimize the process parameters of esterification reaction using disti lled glycerol by response surface methodology.", "- Characterize the products by analyzing the content of free fatty acids, monoglycerides, diglycerides, triglycerides and photometric color index. - Evaluate the effectiveness of crude glycerol, glycerol a cidified with HCl and glycerol acidified with citric acid in the free fatty acids reduction, glycerides formation and color. - Analyze the kinetics curves of products and equilibrium constants of free fatty acid s conversion using different glycerol types.", "3 REVIEW", "3.1 FATTY ACIDS (FAs)", "Fatty acids consist of a long aliphatic chain and a carboxyl group ( -COOH ) with different structures: branched or straight , saturated or unsaturated (MOGHADASIAN; SHAHIDI, 2017) . They are an essential component of lipids in animals, vegetables, and microorganisms. It is uncommon to find them in a free state; generally, they exist conjugated with a glycerol molecule in the form of triglycerides (TAGs) as can be seen in Figure 1 . Figure 1.

The hydrolysis of triglycerides occurs by enzymatic action inside the oilseed kernels or microbiological activity ; it may also take place at high temperatures during oil or fat extraction (OSAWA; GONÇALVES; RAGAZZI, 2007) .

Hydrolysis of triglycerides.", "(DÍAZ; TAPANES; CÂMARA; ARANDA, 2014) The soybean oil and palm oil are the most important vegetable oils worldwide. However, due to the recent surge of urbanization, health consciousness, and the development of the biofuels industry, finding out new oil crops that supply all of these necessities has been crucial . For example, corn oil is a non -edible oi l with a trend of increasing demand in recent years (Figure 3) due to its vast applicability and the easy growth of corn crops. The forecast for global production and marketing of corn oil was 3.3 million tons in 2018 and a revenue of US$ 4.3 billion in 20 19 (IMARCGROUP, 2019; VELJKOVIĆ; BIBERDŽIĆ; BANKOVIĆ -ILIĆ; DJALOVIĆ et al. , Figure 3.

A description and background information of corn oil is given below.", "3.1.2 Corn oil", "Corn oil is extracted from Zea mays L. , commonly referred to as maize or corn. Corn is an annual plant with white or yellow grainy fruit and an average height of 2.5 m. The genus Zea", "consists of four species : Z. luxurians , Z. diploperennis , Z. perennis , and Z. mays . The last one is economically important and has four subgroups , which differ from each other in the shape and color of grains, genetics, and chemical composition. The first steps in domesticating corn were taken by ancient farmers coming from México, about 10 . 000 years ago. Nowadays, corn is mostly cultivated in the United States of America (appr ox.40%) and China (approx. 20%), the remaining producers are Brazil, Indonesia Argentina, Ukraine, India, Mexico, and France (STRABLE; SCANLON, 2009; VELJKOVIĆ; BIBERDŽIĆ; BANKOVIĆ -ILIĆ; DJALOVIĆ et al. , 2018) .", "Historically in Brazil, o milho , how it is called, had been grown and consumed before the arrival of Europeans; the natives used to inclu de this grain in the daily diet. Later, Portuguese introduced novel technologies for corn cropping, and as a consequence, the production was gradually increasing. In 2019/2020, Brazil was responsible for 9.13% of the global corn production and the expectation to 2020/2021 is to grow 0.36% (FARMNEWS, 2020) . This grain is the third most -produce d plant of the tot al agricultural output in this country and represen ted the 17 .7% of the gross domestic product in 2020 (AGÊNCIABRASIL, 2021) . The biggest corn crops are located in Matto Grosso, Matto Grosso do Sul, Goiás, Paraná, Bahia, M inas Gerais and São Paulo. As depicted in Figure 4 , corn kernel comprises four main fractions: 5.5 -6% of hull and fiber (cellulose), 10 -14% of germ (oil, proteins, carbohydrates), 82% of endosperm (starch and proteins), and 1 -2% of tip cap (cellulose). Co rn oil is prim arily extracted from the ger m from corn kernel wet - or dry -milling.", "Figure 4. Corn kernel composition.", "(GWIRTZ; GARCIA -CASAL, 2013)", "Corn oil may also be obtained as a by -product from the bioethanol -makin g process. Due to the high content of starch, corn is an excellent raw material for producing bioethanol. In this procedure, just endosperm is used for fermentation, and the germ, the hull, and the tip cap are part of the stillage. The whole stillage is ce ntrifuged to take out the excess of water, and the remaining solids form the dried distiller grains with solubles (DDGS). Generally, DDGS contains m oisture (11%), protein (30 -31%) and oil (11 -12%) . From DDGS could be obtained distillers corn oil (DCO). The procedure for obtain ing DCO can be harnessed to integrate biodiesel production into corn-based ethanol production, advancing the overal l economy of corn-based biofuels factories (SCOTT; PRATT; HOFFMAN; MONTGOMERY, 2019; VELJKOVIĆ; BIBERDŽIĆ; BANKOVIĆ -ILIĆ; DJALOVIĆ et al. , 2018) .

In 2020, corn eth anol biorefineries extracted 3.3 billion pounds of DCO, and the market reached a value of US$940 million in the United States (RFA, 2021) . Furthermore, about 500 million kg DCO was employed in this country to obtain biodiesel in 2012,", "compared to 1500 million kg in 2017 (U.S.G.C, 2018) . Globally, DCO has a feedstock market share of approximately 13.2% in biodiesel manufacturing (TMR, 2021) . In Brazil, the total production of corn-based ethanol in 2020 was 2.5 billion liter s, with a rise of 1.17 billion liter s compared to 2019 . As a consequence, 27000 metric tons of DDGS were exported to the United Kingdom for the first time in 2019 (BARROS; WOODY, 2020) .

But, o ther m inority lipids such as diglycerides (DAG s), monoglycerides (MAG s), FFA s, phospholipids, tocopherols, sterols, and waxes may be also solubilized in the triglycerides matrix. Its typical dark yellow color is caused by the presence of pigments, principally carotenoids (lutein, zeaxanthin, and β -carotenes) and derivatives from cinnamic acid (BARRERA -ARELLANO; BADAN -RIBEIRO; SERNA - SALDIVAR, 2019) .", "Corn oil belongs to the group of vegeta ble oils with a high level of essential fatty acids as it comprises a relatively high amount of linoleic ( 34-62%) and oleic acid (24 -42%).

Total Brazilian biodiesel production in 2020 was 6.27 billion lit ers with an increase of 6% compared with 2019 (USDA, 2020) . The primary reaction for biodiesel synthesis is the transesterification of TAG s from vegetable oils, animal fats or their mixtures with short -chain alcohol s (methanol or ethanol) in the presence of alkaline catalyst s. Previous works demonstrated that this method is the most e ffective and f avorable when vegetable oils are used as feed stock (GEBREMARIAM; MARCHETTI, 2017; MARCHETTI; MIGUEL; ERRAZU, 2007; PATEL; SHAH, 2015) .

In most cases, it is crucial to purify the crude glycerol for subsequent use as a precursor of chemical derivatives bec ause the impurities could interfere in the conversion reactions .

In the next section more details of this reaction are presented. 3.4 ESTERIFICATION OF FFAs WITH GLYCEROL Esterification is a chem ical reaction in w hich a n organic acid (RCOOH) and an alcohol (ROH) form an ester and water. In this case, FFAs of corn oil are esterified with hydroxyl groups present in glycerol to produce glycerides , which are highly valuable for further biodiesel production . It is often applie d when the acidity content of oil is >5% .", "3.4.1 Reaction mechanism", "In the esterification reaction, r eactants of FFAs with glycerol form a heterogeneous system comprising two phases: (1) liquid -hydrophilic phase containing glycerol and (2) lipid-hydrophobic phase containing glycerides and FFAs (MAMTANI; SHAHBAZ; FARID, 2021; MOSTAFA; MAHER; ABDELMOEZ, 2013) . Indeed, the two phases also have somewhat different densities; therefore they are well differentiated and se parated (FELIZARDO; MACHADO; VERGUEIRO; CORREIA et al. , 2011) . Esterification occu rs as a homogeneous reaction by dissolving gly cerol in the lipid/FFAs phase under a hot and stirred environment. Although temperature and agitation improve the two-phases’ contact, glycerol solubility is limited due to the pyrolytic instability of fat caused by the heat -sensitive double bonds in the aliphatic chain (MUNIYAPPA; BRAMMER; NOUREDDINI, 1996) . Conforming to the electronic theory of organic chemistry (SUDB OROUGH; GITTINS, 1908) , the reaction rate is substantially reduced if the unsaturation position in the carbon chain is adjacent to the carboxylic group. In this reaction scheme, esterification arises continuously: initially, FFAs react with glycerol to produce MAGs; later, MAGs are re -esterified twice to yield DAGs and TAGs . Moreover, three water molecules are generated as by -products. This procedure is described in Figure 14 .", "Figure 14. Esterification of FFAs with glycerol to form TAGs.", "(MAMTANI; SHAHBAZ; FARID, 2021) The fact that esterification reaction co -occurs results in all three glycerides being present in the products at any time . Of the total of MAGs formed through an esterification reaction , the 2 - acyl or β -monoglycerides are often produced at any temperature, from 5 -8% at lower temperatures", "to 30% at the most upper temperatures (SONNTAG, 1982) . When e sterification is carried out under suitable conditions, it turns into a reversible reaction, as stated in the Mass Action law (MIĆIĆ; TOMIĆ; MARTINOVIĆ; KISS et al. , 2019) . Even if it is well -conditioned and keeps a straightforward direction, this reaction is considered as one of the most complicated reactions in oleochemistry (MAMTANI; SHAHBAZ; FARID, 2021; SONNTAG, 1982) . ELGHARBAWY; SADI K; SADEK e KASABY (2021) suggested a esterification reaction mechanism based on the following hypotheses:", "• The reaction starts with the glyceroxide anion formation (OCHOA -GÓMEZ; GÓMEZ - JIMÉNEZ -ABERASTURI; MAESTRO -MADURGA; PESQUERA -RODRÍGUEZ et • The FFAs are decomposed into FFAs radicals and proton H+ under high temperature. • The FFAs free radicals attack the oxy gen of glycerol hydroxyls groups to produce unstable intermediate compounds.", "• The free protons H+ react with the negative bound on the intermediate compound to form gl ycerides (MAG s, DAG s and TAG s) and water.", "The mechanism scheme is depicted in Figure 1 5.", "Figure 15. Esterification reaction mechanism of FFAs with glycerol.", "Adapted from ELGHARBAWY; SADIK; SADEK e KASABY (2021) . Although several authors elucidate th e mechanism and scheme reaction, contemplat ing only the three first phases of the FFAs esterification with glycerol (generating TAGs as a final product), other reactions are happening simultaneously. According to MIĆIĆ; TOMIĆ; MARTINOVIĆ; KISS et al. (2019) , in the first step of esterification reaction, the FFAs reacts with glycerol to form MAG; afterwards, DAGs and TAGs are also produced following the reactions 2- 6 presented below:", "FFA+glycerol↔MAG+ H2O (1) MAG+FFA↔DAG+ H2O (2) DAG+FFA↔TAG+ H2O (3) DAG+glycerol↔2 MAG (4) TAG+glycerol↔DAG+MAG (5) TAG+MAG↔2 DAG (6) Based on this scheme reaction, glycerol not only reacts with FFAs to be esterified but also reacts with DAGs and TAGs to split them into glycerides of minor hierarchy. This reaction is", "known as glycerolysis. Glycerolysis of TAGs is undesirable because the primary objective is to achieve the major quantity of TAGs for subsequent transesterification and biodiesel production. The results repor ted by TU; LU e KNOTHE (2017) indicated that the reaction occurs in two phases as follows: at the first phase, glycer ol is quickly consumed by FFAs, DAGs and TAGs to form MAGs and DAGs (reactions 1, 4 -5); then, at the second phase the MAGs formed react with FFAs to be transformed into DAGs (reaction 2). Finally, DAGs react with FFA to produce TAGs (reaction 3).", "In another work made by AND ERSON; ADDY; XIE; MA et al. (2016) , it was seen that at early reaction stages, FFAs has a slight steric hindrance causing difficulty to discriminate among glycerol or MAGs , when using zinc aluminium oxide and sodium sulfate as catalysts . Hence, reaction 1 is not the unique one responsible for reducing FFAs content at the beginning. The authors also observed that the initial rate of MAGs formation was not pretty different compared with DAGs formation , suggesting that at the first stage MAGs are converted into DAGs simultaneously (reactions 1 -2). Moreover, a second reordering of glycerides occurred when the unbound glycerol and MAGs had equal concentrations. At this phase, glycerides formation depended on the type and presence of catalysts (ANDERSON; ADDY; XIE; MA et al. , 2016) .", "3.1.2 Reaction kinetics", "TU; LU e KNOTHE (2017) researched the reaction kinetic of esterification of FF As present in greas e trap waste.

A.; APESTEGUÍA, C. R.; FERULLO, R. M. et al., 2015; FERRETTI; SPOTTI; DI COSIMO, 2018) . Higher temperatures improve the glycerol solubility in the oily phase and the mass transfer , leading to a right shift in equilibrium (FELIZARDO; MACHADO; VERGUEIRO; CORREIA et al. , 2011) .

(2019)", "3.1.3.3 Glycerol/oil molar ratio and glycerol solubility", "As is already determined, all the reactions are reversible; thus, an excess of glycerol is required to maintain the esterification in a forward direction. Since the reaction occurs in the oily phase, the glycerol concentration should be set carefully. A glycerol/oil ratio beyond the maximum limit will not be beneficial and would only incr ease the volume of the reaction mixture. Another point that needs to be taken into account is the possible TAGs glycerolysis into glycerides of lesser order. A high glyce rol/oil ratio could promote the TAGs glycerolysis. F or that reason the concentration should be chosen between a narrow range of values (MOQUIN; TEMELLI; KING; PALCIC, 2005) . From the economic perspective , it is worth mentioning that to use the lowest glycerol excess for red ucing the downstream processing is desirable, as glycerol needs to be separated from the pre -treated oil for subsequent biodiesel manufacturing .", "Initially, only equimolar reactions were researched by investigators (CHOUDHURY, 1960; HARTMAN, 1966) . Nevertheless , nowadays is broadly known that f or the reaction to be favoring glycerol/oil molar ratio should be at least 2:1 (ECHEVERRI; CARDENO; RÍOS, 2011; GOLE; GOGATE, 2014; ONG; KHAN; RAMLI; YU NUS et al. , 2016) . A glycerol/oil molar ratio of 6:1 at 220 °C and 300 kPa were established as optimum conditions when waste oil was esterified (MADDIKERI; PANDIT; GOGATE, 2012) . It is in line with other stu dies at 6:1 molar ratio glycerol to oil (FELIZARDO; MACHADO; VERGUEIRO; CORREIA et al. , 2011; MIĆIĆ; TOMIĆ; MARTINOVIĆ; KISS et al. , 2019; ZHANENOVA; BEHZADI; FARID, 2009) and 5:1 (PEREZ; ECHEVERRI; RIOS, 2015) . A gly cerol/oil molar ratio above 6:1 value proved not to have an enhancement in the r eaction (MIĆIĆ; TOMIĆ; MARTINOVIĆ; KISS et al. , 2019; ZHANENOVA; BEHZADI; FARID, 2009) .", "The trends for glycerides formation related to glycerol/oil molar ratio rising diverge from each other. As shown in Fi gure 1 7, the MAGs yield follows a similar trend as that of oleic acid transformation in the non -catalyzed esterification with glycerol at 220°C , 600 rpm, 300 min, 80 ml/min N 2 flow. Conversely, for TAGs and DAGs, it follows inversely. This phenom enon could be explained by the promotion of glycerolysis at upper glycerol/acid molar ratios.", "Figure 17.

Related to glycerol solubility, HARTMAN (1966) reported that glycerol is more soluble in caprylic and capric acid than in stearic acid at 180°C (Figure 18 ). Furthermore, in the study , a mixture of acids was esterified with glycerol. The results indicated a lesser stearic acid and an upper caprylic a cid transformation at equimolar and equivalent glycerol/acid ratio s. These findings confirm that glyce rol solubility in the acid raw material influences directly in the esterification reaction.", "Figure 18. Solubility of glycerol at 180 °C in different FAs.", "Adapted from HARTMAN (1966) . 3.1.3.4 Agitation unit", "Agitation is crucial for facilitating the contact among the two reactants and homogenizing the mixture, as stated above. Thus, mechanical or magnetic s tirring is a conventional solution applied in chemical reactions to improve the mass transfer inside the reactional medium. FELIZARDO; MACHADO; VERGUEIRO; CORREIA et al. (2011) studied FFAs esterification with glycerol in a batch reactor at 300 and 500 rpm w ithout catalyst, and there were no substantial enha ncements. On the contrary, a significant difference was en countered using metallic Zn as a catalyst. This event may occur since a triphasic heterogeneous mixture is formed when a catalyst is added; hence, a higher stirring speed is indispensable to preserve the homogeneity and suitable contact between both reactants and catalyst s.", "Several researchers recommend stirring speeds over 600 rpm to achieve a better reaction kinetics (BELELLI, P. G.; FERRETTI, C. A.; APESTEGUÍA, C. R.; FERULLO, R. M. et al. , 2015; WILLIAMSON; SHAHBAZ; MJALLI; ALNASHEF et al. , 2017; ZHANENOVA; BEHZADI; FARID, 2009) . Nonetheless , MIĆIĆ; TOMIĆ; MARTINOVIĆ; KISS et al. (2019) determined that varying the mixing speed did not affect the conversion profiles when waste oil was used as feedstock, adducing that reaction is not limited by the mass transfer. In this study , an intensive mixing of 670 rpm was used for all experi ments.", "On another hand, in -depth s tudies concerning alternatives for conventional agitation ar e not reported in previous works so far. Hydrodynamic cavitation and ultra -sonication have been researched for FFAs esterification reaction with short -chain alcohols (KELKAR; GOGATE; PANDIT, 2008; PATIL; BARAL; DHANKE; KORE, 2020) . Benefits of these techniques are remarked, such as reductions in the required molar /mass ratios, reaction time, temperatures, and better turbulence in the reactional medium compared to mechanical agitation (GOLE; NAVEEN; GOGATE, 2013) . Despite the advantages, their operational costs and technological requirements are not feasible for industrial applications. Due to the FFAs esterification with glycerol is a pre - treatment technique of lesser -grade feedstock for biodiesel production, traders and researchers focus on obtaining maximum yield at minimum cost. Therefore , these methods are not in line with the primary objective.", "3.1.3.5 Glycerol purity", "Pure glycerol has a pH of 6.4 , while crude glycerol is basic with a reported pH of around 9-10 (HU; LUO; WAN; LI, 2012) . The difference is because of the remaining alkali catalyst s from transesterification (HU; LUO; WAN; LI, 2012) . This fact opens up the probability of using crude glycerol for FFAs basic -catalyzed esterification, w hich theoretical ly would boost reaction yield. Though, the amount of soap and water present in crude glycerol may drop the reaction rate. ECHEVERRI; CARDENO e RÍOS (2011) studied the glycerolysis of soybean oil to produce MAGs and DAGs using low -treated crude glycerol (only methanol removal ). The authors discovered that soap present in crude glycerol drops the production of MAGs and promotes DAGs formation at 160 -180°C; it was explained because the soap acts as an emulsifier and helps in MAGs/TAGs contact fostering DAGs formation (reaction 6). They also found that basic catalyst s (NaOH or CH 3ONa) formed soap when water was added to crude glycerol.", "ZHANENOVA; BEHZADI e FARID (2009) compared the glycerides selectivity and oleic acid esterification reaction rate using USP grade glycerol and crude glycerol from soybean methyl esters biodiesel production at 220°C, 600 rpm agitation sp eed, 80 m L/min N 2 purging, and 6:1 glycerol/acid molar ratio. Those optimal conditions were found when USP grade glycerol was used; the oleic acid conversion under this environment was 99.7%, and selectivities towards mono, di, and tri -olein were 83.1%, 13%, and 3.5%, respectively. In opposition, the reaction performed with crude glycerol achieved a c onversion rate of 62.9% and mono -olein selectivity of 49.7%, evidencing a fell of both parameters and the adverse impact of impurities (sodium salts, methanol, soap and water ) on esterification reaction. Figure 19 details the decrease of esterification eff iciency with the rise in the impurity grade of glycerol. The diminution of available glycerol quantity per mol of crude glycerol is the reas on behind this observed behavio r.", "Figure 19. Effects of impurity grade of glycerol on FFAs esterification reaction.", "Adapted from MAMTANI; SHAHBAZ e FARID (2021) .", "SAN KONG; AROUA; DAUD; COGNET et al. (2016) researched the influence of crude glycerol impurities on oleic acid esterification under microwave assistance. In this study, crude glycerol purities of 69.90%, 86.21% and USP grade glycerol were tested. The results confirmed that moisture negatively affec ted the oleic acid conversion. That conclusion was drawn w hen the glycerol 70% pure produced a higher FFAs conversion than the 82.21% pure, while the analyses indicated that the moisture percent in the second one was higher . A reason for this event is that ester linkages are prone to be hydrolyzed, triggering the formation of FFAs; besides, the hygroscopic nature of glycerol aids it (ISLAM; FARD MASOUMI; HWA TEO; ABDOLLAHI et al., 2016) . Even though th e reaction took place under a N 2 purging system, it was not enough to preserve the forward equilibrium direction. The researchers also identified a low quantity of methyl oleate in the reaction medium, since some methanol in crude glycerol reacted with oleic acid. ELGHARBAWY; SADIK; SADEK e KASABY (2021) performed a previous work esterifying fish waste oil and palm waste oil using crude glycerol purified through a cheap method and UPS grade glycerol. The es terification was conducted at 150 °C, 600 rpm agitation speed , glycerol/oil mass ratios of 1:1 -2:1 and reaction time of 60 min . The cheap purification method for crude glycerol comprised: filtration, washing with ethanol and heating. No significant differences were found in the FFAs conversion between both glycerol types at both glycerol/oil mass ratios. All of the studies prese nted above were made considering the al kalinity of the crude glycerol. H owever, no register was found regarding the use of weakly -acidic crude glycerol for", "FFAs esterification. As discussed in section 3.3 , acid solutions (HCl, H2SO4, H3PO4 and organic acids) are used to neutralize the remaining basic catalyst and dissociate soap. Since not all acid molecules react with alkali -catalyst and soaps, a bit of acid surplus keeps immersed into the crude glycerol, generating a weak acid character. This acid residua l might act as a catalyst in subsequent esterification reaction, making it an excellent option to re -use crude glycerol in-situ applying a low - cost and simple one-step neutralization.", "Because of the benefits aforesaid, the use of mineral and organic acids as catalysts is the subject of this work. The next topic will detail previous research on employing homogeneous acid catalysts in esterification reaction between FFAs and glycerol.", "3.1.3.6 Catalysis and acid catalyst s", "An important issue related to the esterification reaction with glycerol is the high energetical requirement in terms of temperature, ag itation, and pressure. Catalysis could be an excellent option for carrying out the reaction under mild conditions and achieving an optimum yield. Moreover, catalysts will intensify the selectivity towards th e desired products and decrease co-products.", "Typically, there are three types of catalysts: homogeneous, heterogeneous, and enzymes . In the industrial application of esterification reactio n with glycerol, acid or basic homogeneous catalysts are commonly used because they are more feasible and cheaper than enzy mes and heterogeneous catalysts . Some drawbacks associated with acid homogeneous catalysts are the side - reaction s, difficulty to remove them from the final product, and corrosion of reactors (JYOTI; KESHAV; ANANDKUMAR; BHOI, 2018) . It has been reported that secondary reactions arise at high temperatures in the presence of acids, leading to a color darkening of final products (ÅKERMAN; GABER; GHANI; LÄMSÄ et al., 2011; COTERON; MARTINEZ; ARACIL, 1998; ISBELL; KLEIMAN; PLATTNER, 1994; MAQUIRRIAIN; QUERINI; PISARELLO, 2021) . Some of the secondary products formed from glycerol and catalyzed by acids are polyglycerols, oxygenated heterocyclic compounds and branched polyols (ZHOU; BELTRAMINI; FAN ; LU, 2008) . Besides, it should be taken into account that the decomposition of glycerol into acrole in is stimu lated by acid catalysis at higher temperatures (200 °C- 250°C) (ESTEVEZ; LOPEZ - PEDRAJAS; BLANCO -BONILLA; LUNA et al. , 2015) .", "Side-reaction s between FFAs and acid catalysts comprises generation of lactones (ISBELL; KLEIMAN; PLATTNER, 1994) , estolites (ÅKERMAN; GABER; GHANI; LÄMSÄ et al., 2011; ISBELL; KLEIMAN; PLATTNER, 1994) and polymers (SHOWELL; SWER N; NOBLE, 1968) . These compounds have high molecular weight and may decrease the reaction yield. The alkylation of the acid catalyst with the alcohol (glycerol) is another undesirable secondary reaction as it forms water and diminishes the amount of ava ilable acid catalyst in the reaction mixture. PISARELLO; DALLA COSTA; MENDOW e QUERINI (2010) studied and quantified this reaction in the esterification of high acidity raw materials using methanol and ethanol with sulfuric acid as a catalyst. The researchers observed kinetic constant variations in function of time and attributed this behavio r to the mono and dialkylsulphates formation. The alkylation reaction between glycerol and acids (sulfuric, p -toluensulfonic and methanesulfonic) was reported by MAQUIRRIAIN; QUERINI e PISARELLO (2021) . The reaction was carried out at 120°C. The authors established that sulfuric acid had a major loss and decreased to approximately half of the initial value after 180 min. In all studied cases, the darkening of the final product was after 120 min, reaching a strong black c olor at 180 min. Those results conclude that glycerol degradation in acid medium causes the formation of dark compounds even in the absence of FFAs.", "For acid -catalyzed FFAs esterification reaction with glycerol , investigators have principally used heteropolyacids (HOO; ABDULLAH, 2014) , sulfuric acid (MAQUIRRIAIN; QUERINI; PISARELLO, 2021; MOHOD; GOGATE, 2018) , p-toluensulfonic acid (Dı́AZ; MOHINO; PÉREZ -PARIENTE; SASTRE, 2001; MAQUIRRIAIN; QUERINI; PISARELLO, 2021) and methanesulfonic acid (MAQUIRRIAIN; QUERINI; PISARELLO, 2021) . Despite that, mineral acids such as HCl and H 2SO 4 could be the better option as they are commodity chem icals of relatively low price and might be recovered and re-used.", "Hydrochloric acid has not been studied broadly as a catalyst for esterification reaction between FFAs and glycerol . Several studies related to this mineral acid are reported employing methanol.

This study aimed at examining the recoverab ility and reusability of such homogeneous catalysts and their capability of FFAs reduction. HCl 0.5M demonstrated to be the more suitable catalyst since it was possible to reuse it five times with only a slight decrease in catalytic activity ; besides , the FFAs conversion was 98.44% . This study also proved that HCl exhibited a higher tolerance for accumulating water than other acids.", "BOUCHER; UNKER; HAWLEY; WILHITE et al. (2008) evaluated the recoverability and reuse of HCl (36% purity) and H 2SO 4 (97% purity) when linoleic acid blended with TAGs was esterified with methanol. The experiment was conducted at 70 °C, methanol/oil ratio of 6:1 and magnetic stirring . Optimal results were met using HCl 1 %wt. , which was reused three times for esterification and did not present a significant lessen i n rate constant contrasted with H 2SO 4. A remarkable observation made in this work was that acids also catalyzed the reaction transformation of TAGs to DAGs after the FFAs concentration became the minimum value. On the other side, the use of organic acids as catalysts for esterification reaction are unavailable in previous literature. Organic acids could be a sustainable and economic choice since they are o btained from renewable sources, less harmful and do not need corrosion -resistant equipment. This study will center on using citric acid as an organic and green option and hydrochloric acid as mineral acid because of the high possibility of recovery, re -use and availability.", "3.1.3.7 Problems linked with FFAs esterification using glycerol", "As was discus sed above, for the esterification reaction to be favorable, longer reaction times, high temperatures, strong stirring speeds and continuous water removal are required.

As can be seen, the p-value of the model is inferior to 0.05, evidencing that the model is able to explain the data. In opposition, t he lack of fit presents a p-value superior to 5%, which means the null hypothesis (the model error mean square is equal to the pure error) is accepted and it is concluded that model error provides a consistent estimate of the truth variance.

From Figure 38a, it is possible to affirm that high vacuum (50 mbar) improves FFA reduction (5.87%). As is well-known, water is a co -product formed on the FFAs esterification reaction and it has to be removed. Under a strong vacuum, water removal is more efficient since the boiling point of the reactional medium is reduced; then, water can be evaporated quickly (OLIVEIRA; TELES; QUEIMADA; COUTINHO, 2009) . In the presence of water, glycerides are hydrolyzed until forming FFAs, negativel y affecting the chemical equ ilibrium (BELELLI , P. G.; FERRETTI, C. A.; APESTEGUÍA, C. R.; FERULLO, R. M. et al. , 2015; MIĆIĆ; TOMIĆ; MARTINOVIĆ; KISS et al., 2019) . The influence of glycerol/oil mas s ratio is depicted in Figure 38 b. As can be observed, a glycerol concentration above the stoichiometric quantity aids the FFAs conversion.

This plot demonstrates that the FFAs conversion increases with the increase of temperature. A temperature rise affords a good homogenization of the reaction medium and positively affects the reaction kinetics that obeys the Arrhenius Law (BELELLI, P G; FERRETTI, C A; APESTEGUÍA, C R; FERULLO, R M et al. , 2015; FERRETI; SPPOTTI; DI COSIMO, 2018) . The mass transfer between FFAs/glycerol is also improved since the glycerol is more soluble as temperature increases. According to NOUREDDINI; HARKEY e GUTSMAN (2004) , the glycerol solubility i n common fats at room temperature is 4 -5wt.%; however, at 250 °C it reaches about 45 -50 wt.% .", "Figure 38.

As can be perceived, at high vacuum s, the oil color diminishes (Figure 67a). This event is supported by the fact that water is effectively carried away under a severe vacuum. As is well-known, the presence of water leads to the hydrolysis of TAGs, producing polar glycerides (DAGs and MAGs) (DOBARGANES; MÁRQUEZ -RUIZ, 2007) . In line with a previous investigation, these polar compounds increase the final oil color (FERRETI; SPPOTTI; DI COSIMO, 2018) . From Figure 67b, it is evidenced that as the glycerol/oil mass ratio increases (from 1.5 to 2) the oil color also increases. At high glycerol/oil ratios (wt./wt.) glycerolysis of glyce rides may be stimulated, producing MAGs and DAGs like products (reactions 4 -5). Figure 67c reveals that high temperatures rise up the oil color. Under upper temperatures, oil degradation occurs, yielding dark products (GOLE; GOGATE, 2014; WANG, YOUNG; MA, SHUN; WANG, LILI; TANG, SHUZE et al. , 2012) . For example, TAGs are decomposed into MAGs, DAGs, cyclic monomeric TAGs, isomeric TAGs, and non -polar dimeric TAGs (DOB ARGANES; MÁRQUEZ -RUIZ, 2007) . Furthermore, if the system is not entirely closed and exists a little air interaction, oxidation side -products like peroxides, ketones, carboxylic acids, alkanes and short - chain alkenes are formed (ANDERSSON; LINGNERT, 1998) .", "Figure 67. Main effect plot showing the effect of vacuum, glycerol/oil mass ratio and temperature on PCI response.", "The surface plots in 3D are displayed in Figure 68. The relationship between temperature and vacuum (Figure 68a) is different from the temperature a nd glycerol/oil ratio (wt./wt.).

The first section reveals that the temperature does not strongly influence the PCI value at a severe vacuum. Conversely, the contour demonstrates a slight slope in the second section, adducing that temperature should be lesser at this vacuum range to obtain a PCI va lue of 0.83 -1. This event could be attributed to the quantity of water produced at upper temperatures. It means the esterification is enhanced at high temperatures. Consequently, more water molecules are formed, requiring a severe vacuum to remove them and", "reduce the TAGs hydrolysis. Figure 69b depicts the isocurve related to temperature and glycerol/oil mass ratio. This contour plot indicates that a lesser PCI value is met when the temperature is low, and the glycerol/oil mass ratio is between 1.15 -1.60.

Figure 72 represents the kinetics curve s of the esterification reaction using distilled glycerol. As can be seen at the first hour, there exists a little bit increase in TAGs content, a reduction of MAGs, and a considerable rise in DAGs. This event may be supported by the fact that FFAs have a slight steric hindrance at earlier phases of reaction affecting the capacity of differentiation between glycerol and MAGs (ANDERSON; ADDY; XIE; MA et al., 2016) . In this case, FFAs are reacting more with MAGs to form DAGs (reaction 2) and TAGs (reaction 3) rather than with glycerol (reaction 1). After the first hour, the TAGs are diminishing, the MAGs and DAGs are consecutively developing, and FFAs dro p. This reaction performance is kept up until reaching the 13 hours of reaction. Those observations are in line with TU; LU e KNOTHE (2017) , who concluded that FFAs, DAGs and TAGs speedily consume glycerol to form MAGs and DAGs (react ions 1, 4 -5). ANDERSON; ADDY; XIE; MA et al. (2016) also proved the non -notable", "difference among the formation rate of MAGs and DAGs after a certain reaction time, adducing a simultaneous conversion of FFAs to MAGs and MAGs to DAGs (reactions 1 -2). On the other hand, PCI seems to diminish until reaching 4 hours and increases from that point of time . In previous research, the degradation of carotenoids (pigments) at temperatures of 55 -100°C led to color fading in corn oil (QIAN; DECKER; XIAO; MCCLEMENTS, 20 12). The initial drop in the PCI might be explained by reducing FFAs and the start of pigments degradation.", "The polar and none -polar compounds formed from 1) TAGs degra dation, 2) oxidation reactions , 3) antioxidants reduction, and 4 ) phospholipids degradation causes the increase in oi l color under high temperatures. Therefore, the PCI augmenting after 4 hours may be due to the increase in the formation of MAGs and DAGs and the oil degradation. Under higher temperatures, oil darkening i s produced due to the breakdown of TAGs into : MAGs, DAGs, cyclic monomeric TAGs, isomeric TAGs, and nonpolar dimeric TAGs (DOBARGANES; MÁRQUEZ -RUIZ, 2007) .", "Besides, possible oxidation reactions yield dark products such as peroxides, ketones, carboxylic acids, alkanes and short -chain alkenes (ANDERSSON; LINGNERT, 1998) . The reduction of a sizable amount of tocopherols (antioxidant s) later this time may also be a reason behind such color increase. As was shown in Table 2, crude corn oil has these antioxidants dissolved in the TAGs matrix. ZHANG; XU; JIANG e WANG (2013) found out that the tocopherols reduction was linearly related to color darke ning of medium -chain triacylglycerols under 105 °C at a time interval of 12 h. Another motive of color darkening could be the decomposition of phospholipids present in crude corn oil under a hot environment, chiefly in the presence of humidity (CRA, 2006) . Even if side -reactions are develop ing, the final PCI is lesser than the initial. It might occur because the polar compounds generated on the oil degradation, are dissolved by the glycerol that has a polar character. This fact was also corroborated by the visual appearance of the separated glycerol -rich phase, which presented a light yellow color. Similar annotations were done by MIĆIĆ; TOMIĆ; MARTINOVIĆ; KISS et al. (2019) when FFAs present in waste oil were esterified employing distilled glycerol. Mićić and coauthors observed that the color of the final treated -oil changed from brown to clear yellow and viscos ity lessened.", "Figure 72.

At the first hour, the MAGs concentration is flat compared to DAGs content due to the steric hindrance of FFAs. From this plot, it is also possible to infer that FFAs curve is not continuously decreasing and consumption is slower. Apparently, the water delays in transforming FFAs into MAGs since it drives the chemical equilibrium in the left direction (reverse reaction 1). The MAGs curve presents several falls at specific intervals of time. Meaning that, MAGs formation shows difficulties for preserving the right direction at such intervals. TAGs profile is constantly decreasing over time, whereas DAGs are rising. This event demonstrates the adverse effect of water on TAGs production because of the promotion of hydrolysis reaction (reverse reaction 3) . From the PCI profile, i t is evidenced a diminishing up to hours. The last DCO color is lighter than the initial since polar compounds are dissolved inside the glycerol -rich phase that was split out from the oily phase.", "MAG DAG TAG PCI Tempo (h)% m/m PCI Time (h)% wt.Glicerina destilada PCI", "Figure 73.

As can be perceived during the first hour, MAGs and DAGs building co - occur and DAGs content notably rises. This phenom enon is because the FFAs react more with MAGs instead of glycerol, fostering DAGs as products. After this point in time, MAGs and DAGs are continuously increasing (DAGs more than MAGs), while TAGs are constantly depleting. A possible explanation is that becaus e of substantial MAGs generation and soap surplus , TAGs react with MAGs to produce DAGs (reaction 6) . The soap existing in crude glycerol acts as an emulsifier, stimulating the reaction between MAGs and DAGs (ECHEVERRI; CARDENO; RÍOS, 2011) . Besides, TAGs may be undergoing glycerolysis, obtaining DAGs as products (reaction 5). It is also noticed a rapid reduction of FFAs, confirming the hypothesis that weak -acidic glycerol e nhances the FFAs esterification since acid works as a catalyst. These findings differ from earlier studies performed using alkaline crude glycerol as in those, th e FFAs transformation decreased (MAMTANI; SHAHBAZ; FARID, 2021; SAN KONG; AROUA; DAUD; COGNET et al. , 2016; ZHANENOVA; BEHZADI; FARID, 2009) . Nonetheless, other composites and elements (as was described in Table 4) in crude glycerol such as salts, methanol glut and ash , are probably catalyzing undesirable TAGs glycerolysis and decomposition. As shown in t he PCI curve , the usage of crude glycerol brings about an important influence on DCO color. Throughout the first 4 hours, a fading of oil is exhibited. But, past this MAG DAG TAG PCI Tempo (h)% m/m PCI Time (h)% wt.Glicerina+agua PCI", "time, the color turns dark. It seems to be that the additional components present in crude glycerol are reacting with minor oil components (pigments, phospholipids, antioxidants) and gl ycerides , originating dark unwanted products. Indeed, the extra constituents of crude glycerol could lead to glycerol degradation under elevated temperatures. The intensely d ark color of the separated rich - glycerol phase evidenced this event after the reaction ended up.", "From the FFAs profile, it is possible to say that there are no significant differences between the value obtained at 10 and 13 hours. Thus, 10 hours could be sufficient to reduce the FFAs content lower than 5%. From a industrial perspective, less time is desira ble for reduction of cost and in view of the better resu lts in relation to TAGs and PCI, 10 hours are highly benefic ial. Figure 74.

From the subfigures a -d, it is possible to conclude that MAGs and DAGs formation is superior when employing crude glycerol than distilled and dissolved glycerol . Conversely, the TAGs and FFAs conten ts are inferior. The possible reasons are: 1) the acid existent in crude glycerol composition works as a catalyst for FFAs conversion into MAGs/DAG and 2) the additional components promote the glycerolysis and hydrolysis of TAGs. It is essential to highlight that crude glycerol also contains water.

The course of DCO color along the reaction time is illustrated in Figure 74d. As can be seen, the darkening of color is up per using crude glycerol than distilled and dissolved. This fact suggests that the acid and other components of crude glycerol boost the degradation of oil. Surprisingly, the lower PCI value is obtained with the usage of dissolved glycerol.

From subfigures 77 a -e, it is possible to state that the worst results in terms of glycerides and PCI are obtained with an HCl concentration of 10% at 13 hours of reaction : high", "content of MAGs, low content of DAGs/TAGs, and intense dark color. Although the FFAs conversion is good, other responses are not in agreement with the goal of th is research. The outcomes also prove that as the HCl load increase, the MAGs content and PCI increase; this suggests a likely catalytic activity of HCl on the hydrolysis/glycerolysis of DAGs/TAGs (reverse reaction 2, reactions 4 -5) and the conversion of TA Gs into DAGs throughout the reaction 6. For the acid concentration of 0.1%, the glycerides responses present a slow reduction of TAGs, low MAGs content, a somewhat amount of DAGs and low PCI value. Nonetheless, the acidity of the final oil at the end is 6. 2%, which does not meet the purpose of reducing the FFAs to <5%. The values for all responses in the final pre -treated DCO employing an acid load of 1% at a time length of 13 hours reveal a higher amount of TAGs, an acceptable content of MAGs and DAGs, a FFAs content of 3.64% and a PCI a bit beyond the initial DCO color. These findings draw in the conclusion that the acid load influences on FFAs conversion. It is crucial to remark th at a bit of acid is lost during the procedure, elucidating why the lower acid concentration (0.1%) did not work satisfactorily on FFAs reduction . From MAGs and DAGs kinetics profiles at 1% of hydrochloric acid, it is evidenced that the concentrations are s imilar till getting 10 hours reaction. That phenom enon suggests a concurrent formation of MAGs and DAGs, proving that MAGs also consume FFAs to produce DAGs (reaction 2). The low TAGs reduction may be attributed to a bit of production of TAGs (reaction 3). It means, even if a quite production of TAGs is occurring, TAGs decomposition is persistent over time. TAGs depletion is more marked afterward 10 hours of reaction.", "On the other hand, the final oil and the glycerol split out from the reaction mixture we re dark brown (Figure 76 ). An explanation for the oil and glycerol darkness and the acid mislaid is that some secondary reactions are carried out under high temperatures in the presence of acids. For example, reactions between FFAs and acid catalysts gener ate lactones, estolites and polymers (ÅKERMAN; GABER; GHANI; LÄMSÄ et al., 2011; ISBELL; KLEIMAN; PLATTNER, 1994; SHOWELL; SWERN; NOBLE, 1968) . Acid catalysts react with glycerol forming polyglycerols, oxygenated heterocyclic compounds, branched polyols and acrolein (ZHOU; BELTRAMINI; FAN; LU, 2008) . Besides, t he alkylation of hydrochloric acid with glycerol leads to the formation of monoalkylchlorates. Several authors proved that alkylations of acid catalysts leads to the darkening of the final product when glycerol is used for esterifying FFAs (MAQUIRRIAIN;", "QUERINI; PISARELLO, 2021; PISARELLO; DALLA COSTA; MENDOW; QUERINI, 2010) . The minor components of the oil, like tocopherols, pigments, and phospholipids, may also be degraded by the acid, triggering dark subproducts.", "Figure 76. Visual appearance of DCO treated with glycerol acidified with HCl 1 %.", "It is also noticed from Figure 77 c that FFAs conversion decreases after 8 hours. In the last 5 hours, only 2% of FFAs are reduced, whereas approximately 6% of TAGs are consumed simultaneously. Same annotations were observed in an earlier work conducted by BOUCHER; UNKER; HAWLEY; WILHITE et al. (2008) . The researchers evaluated the esterification reaction among FFAs and methanol employing HCl 1 %wt. as a catalyst and co ncluded, the acid also catalyzed the reaction conversion of TAGs into DAGs after the FFAs concentration became the minimum value. Thus, the reaction time must be set carefully, trying no t to promote TAGs breakdown.", "Contrasting the found results employing glycerol acidified with HCl and control tests, it is possible to affirm that the acid content in crude glycerol influences on PCI. Nevertheless, the PCI values are higher with crude glycerol than with acid glycerol a t 0.1% and 1%. This observation suggests that other components in crude glycerol also aid the DCO darkening and degradation. The TAGs depletion is major using crude glycerol than using acid glycerol at 0.1% and 1%, meaning that the contaminants present in crude glycerol work as catalysts for TAGs decomposition. The upper concentration of MAGs and DAGs when employing crude glycerol supports that assumption.", "Related to FFAs reduction, the kinetic curve seems to be similar to the curve conducted with glycerol acidified with HCl at 1%. Such a result evidences the catalytic activity of acid on FFAs conversion. As was aforementioned, the acidity of crude glycerol in terms of HCl was 0.1%. In this way, comparing the FFAs conversion between acid glycerol at 0.1% and crude glycerol, a higher FFAs content is determined using acid glycerol at 0.1%. A possible explanation is that other contaminants present in crude glycerol also act as catalysts on FFAs reduction. Making an evaluation among dissolved glycerol and acid glycerol (0.1% and 1% of HCl), it looks like the water effect is almost insignificant when employing acid glycerol (80% v/v glycerol to water). This phenom enon could be explained by the fact that t he strong catalytic character of HCl is sufficient to drive the reaction in the proper direction. A considerable effect of water would be the diminishing of available glycerol; in other words, it would act as a limiting reagent since the glycerol is dissolved. This fact could impede obtaining a better yield on FFA s reduction.", "Figure 77.

Thereby, the best response will be selected within these three times. The decision is a little tricky with the naked eye because of the almost negl igible difference among the values. Aiming at facilitating the decision and determining whether the means are different between them, the one -way ANOVA with repeated measures test is conducted together with the Tukey test for all responses at a c onfidence level of 99% (Table 26 ) using the software Origin 2018 . Prior to ANOVA, the normality of responses has to be verified. For this, a Shapiro -Wilk test was performed, and the outcomes confirmed that all values follow a Gaussian curve. As can be seen, the p-values for all ANOVA tests are < 0.01, meaning that there exists a difference between at least two means. Once the null hypothesis i s rejected, the Tukey test is performed to detect which means are significantly dissimilar from each other related to the reaction time. None -considerable difference between 8 and 10 hours is detected according to Tukey outputs assessed by the software (p-values >0.01) for all the responses. Conversely, for 13 and 8 hours, only DAGs content is similar. From an economic perspective, lesser time is desirable due to the cost reduction ; furthermore, considering the higher TAGs consumption after 8 hours and the similarity of results at 8 and 10 hours, the best response is chosen at 8 hours and HCl load of 1%: FFAs of 5.1±0.3 %wt., MAGs of 19.2 ±1.7 %wt., DAGs of 22.7±3.7 Table 26.

A somewhat different approach is encountered for acidic dissolved glycerol with 10% of citric acid in terms of MAGs and DAGs. Apparently, the DAGs formation is slower than other acid concentrations (0.1 and 1%); however, the concentration is similar for all cases at the final point in time (13 h). This DAGs del ay at 10% may b e caused by the glycerolysis, hydrolysis of DAGs (reverse reaction 2 and reaction 4). The rapid growth of MAGs until reaching 8 hours corroborates that statement. Another reason behind that phenom enon may be secondary reactio ns between citri c acid/glycerol, citric acid/FFAs and citric acid/glycerides . It is reported that under high temperatures, the citric acid undergoes polycondensation with glycerol, forming the polyester glycerol citrate (WRZECIONEK; MATYSZCZAK; BANDZEREWICZ; RUŚKOWSKI et al. , 2021) . Moreover, the citric acid (in the same manner as HCl) could suffer alkylation when reacting with glycerol, producing alkylcitrates. Additional side-products are the citrateglycerides , made from the esterification of citric acid with MAGs and DAGs (GAUPP; ADAMS, 2014) . It is well-known that reactions between FFAs and mineral acids (HCl, H 2SO 4) generate lactones, estolites and polymers . In this particular case, the organic acid usage might produce more complex subproducts coming from citric acid/FFAs reactions. All of the mentioned side -reactions are aided by citric acid concentration. Hence, at 10% of citric acid load, such undesirable reactions delay the", "course of the reaction in two ways: the FFAs/glycerol and MAGs/FFAs contacts are disturbed because of polymeric secondary compounds.", "Related to the TAGs profiles, it is exhibited a high TAGs decomposition under all citric acid concent rations. This event suggests that citric acid catalyzes TAGs glycerolysis and hydrolysis, being inefficient for catalyzing the transformation of DAGs into TAGs. On the other hand, a quite difference in PCI behavior is detected at all acid loads until 10 hours of reaction (Figure 79 e), especially among 0.1% and 1 -10% of the citric acid dosage. The PCI rises more quickly after three hours for 0.1%, while it rises slowly for 1 -10%. Although the performance s are somewhat different, the final PCI valu e is the same at the last 13 hours in all acid dosages. A likely motive may be that at a citric acid dosage of 0.1% the side -reactions aforesaid are less prone to happen due to the lesser citric acid concentration in the reaction mixture. Thus, the darkeni ng of the oil is more noteworthy. This event is supported by the fact that the color of subproducts is opaque. For example, glycerol citrate is a white -opaque polymer (TISSERAT; SELLING; BYARS; STUFF, 2012) . The color of citroglycerides is from white to ivory -coloured (GAUPP; ADAMS, 2014) . These statements corroborate that the presence of white subproducts make the oil color lighter. It is crucial to remark that other complex side -products could influence the final color of oil : the alkylcitrates, compounds from FFAs/citric acid reaction , phospholipids degradation, pigme nts and antioxidants reductions . The alkylcitrates coming from FFAs/citric acid reaction give the impression to be light yellow or white, based on the observation of the final pre- treated oil (Figure 78) .", "Figure 78. Visual appearance of DCO treated with glycerol acidified with citric acid 0.1%.", "The visual appearance of the final product along the time confirms the existence of opaque polymer compounds inside the separated oily phase (Figure 78) . The final DCO seems more viscose and dense, mainly at citric acid loads of 1 -10%. According to GAUPP e ADAMS (2014) , citroglyce rides are insoluble in cold water, dispersible in hot water and soluble in oil and fats. In the same way, glycerol citrate is soluble in water after several days (8 -10 days) of exposition because of the partial hydrolysis of cross -links (PRAMANICK; RAY, 1988) . Nevertheless, when the glycerol citrate formed is hyperbranched have low viscosities and high solubility (ZAHLAN; SAEED; ALRASHEED; ALANDES et al. , 2019) . Hence, glycerol citrate could stay in both oily and glycerol/water phases and, citroglycerides are primary in the oily phase.", "Comparing the results of citric acid and control tests (Figure 78a -e), it can be inferred that using citric acid is better for obtaining a final product with a FFAs content < 5 % wt., a higher concentration of TAGs, and lower PCI in a time length of 13 hours .", "Figure 79.

As can be perceived, the more relevant results are attained in 13 hours of reaction and citric acid concentrations of 0.1 and 1%. Even if at 10% of citric acid loa d, the outcomes are similar, a lower citric acid concentration is desirable for diminishing the production of polymeric compounds. Thereby, the best condition will be chosen between 0.1 and 1% in a time length of 13 hours. For this purpose, one -way ANOVA i s carried out at a confidence level of 99%. The Shapiro -Wilk test was previously conducted to prove the normality of data. Based on the outputs assessed by the software (Table 28 ), it is possible to determine that the means for the two treatments are none - significant different on FFAs, DAGs, TAGs and PCI responses ( p-values > 0.01). On the contrary, for MAGs, the means are dissimilar ( p-value <0.01). Thus, the best response is selected at 13 hours and a citric acid load of 0.1%: FFAs of 4,9±0,6 %wt., MAGs of 20.0±1.0 %wt., DAGs of 34.7±2.5 Table 28.

For this, the outcomes obtained from using acid dissolved glycerol at 0.1% of citric acid and 1% of HCl are explored along with control tests (Figure 80 ). As is shown in Figures 80 a-e, the most satisfactory responses are generated when employing acid dissolved glycerol at 1% of HCl in 8 h. Based on the kineti c performance of FFAs (Figure 80 d), it can be noticed that at the first hour, the FFAs reduction using dissolved acid glycerol (1% of HCl) and crude is faster. Past the first hour, the FFAs diminishing is slow and gradually occurs. Such behavior is more noteworthy for dissolved acid glycerol (1% HCl) since the FFAs reduction is higher . This phenomenon is in line with the sig hted by FEUGE; KRAEMER e BAILEY (1945) , who found that the FFAs reduction happened in two stages, and at the first stage, the reaction rate of FFAs conversion was higher than the near completion stage. That conclusion would clarify why the MAGs and DAGs are simultaneously forming and , TAGs increase when using dissolved acid glycerol (1% of HCl) over 1 hour of reaction: FFAs are being consumed not only by glycerol but also by MAGs and DAGs to produce DAGs and TAG (reaction s 1-3), respectively. From 2 to 13 hours, those reactions are also occurring, however intermittently. In the case of crude glycerol, the important FFAs reduction at the first hour is due to the FFAs are reacting with glycerol and MAGs ( reaction s 1-2), the rapid growth of DAGs corroborates this event. Another motive for DAGs extensive rise is that at the first stage of reaction, TAGs underwent glycerolysis. Similar annotation was done in a previous work employing crude glycerol (TU; LU; KNOTHE, 2017) . Past the first hour, reactions 2 -3 are happening irregularly. For the esterification conducted with dissolved acid gl ycerol (0.1% of citric acid), the FFAs profile shows a steady reduction along the 13 hours of reaction. It appears to be similar to the blank test (distilled glycerol). At the first hour in both cases, the MAGs content diminishes,", "DAGs considerably grow, T AGs increase a bit, and FFAs are somewhat converted. Meaning that, in this first phase FFAs are consumed chiefly by MAGs and DAGs (reactions 2 -3) than by glycerol (reaction 1). This performance is upheld until the fourth hour using distilled glycerol, which is different for dissolved acid glycerol (0.1% of citric acid). In the second case, after 1 hour the FFAs are consumed mainly by glycerol and a bit by MAGs. In the situation of acid glycerol (0.1% of citric acid), t he rise of DAGs is attributed principally to TAGs breakdown (reactions 4, 6) , being corroborated by the TAGs significant diminishing from 2 to 13 hours.", "The PCI performance (Figure 80 e) exhibits that esterification carried out with cru de glycerol produces the darkes t final oil at 13 hours of reaction. Even if the reaction is made during 10 hours (selected as the best time) , the worst result for PCI is obtained for crude glycerol.", "Figure 80.

Once the best acid concentrations are chosen for both acid types (hydrochloric and citric), the constants rates ( k) are predicted and prospected by linear regression and the use of different order reactions: zero, first, second and third. After Equation 3 ( section 4.4.4.1) was linearized through integration, the plots were constructed by plotting X -axis versus Y -axis. Then, the slope of the plot will be the reaction rate constant. The R2 and R2-Adjustment for all reaction orders are presented in Table 2 9. The yellow highlights represent the higher values of R2 and R2-Adjustment for each type of glycerol.", "As can be seen, a first -order kinetic rate is able to explain the FFAs data when crude glycerol and acid dissolved glycerol (0.1% of citric acid) are employed. This event proves that the reaction rate depends on the concentration of one reactant or one mol of FFAs under those specific conditions. TU; LU e KNOTHE (2017) reported a first -order kinetic rate for the FFAs est erification using none -neutralized alkaline crude glycerol at 230 °C. In the same manner, ANDERSON; ADDY; XIE; MA et al. (2016) determined that first -order kinetic rate was suitable to fit the FFAs values in uncatal yzed, Zn -Al2SO 4 catalyzed and Na 2SO 4 catalyzed esterification reaction s under a temperature of 238 °C.", "On the contrary, for the usage of distilled, dissolved and dissolved acid glycerol (1% of HCl) the second -order kinetic rate is the finest for fitting the FFAs data. Concl uding that, two moles of FFAs or two reactants influence the reaction rate at those p articular reaction environments. A similar conclusion was established by FEUGE; KRAEMER e BAILEY (1945) . They studied the uncatalyzed and catalyzed esterification reaction between FFAs and distilled glycerol i n a temperature range of 166 -241°C. Besides, t he investigators defined that the reaction is fundamentally bimolecular . Other earlier research in which oleic acid is esterified applying methanol concluded that the reaction obeys a second -order reaction rate (CANAKCI; VAN", "Based on the examination done for Figure 80 (section 5.3.3), the variances on reaction rate orders may be supported by the fact that two reactions are responsibl e for FFAs diminishing over time using crude and dissolved acid glycerol (0.1% of citric acid). For the first one, reac tions 1,2 are prominent. F or the second one, reactions 2, 3 persist at the first hour and rea ctions 1, 2 from 2 to 13 hours. On the contrary, in the case of distilled and dissolved acid glycerol (1% of HCl ), three reactions are primar y govern the system. For the first one, reactions 1 -3 are noticeable until 4 hours and after this time reactions 1,2 are more prominent. For the second one, reactions 1 -3 are arising over the time. Thus, the first -order rate explains the FFAs data when two reactions are the principal and the second -order rate fits the FFAs values when three reactions are prominent. This conclusion is compatible with the fact that the rate depends on one mol of FFAs in first -order reactions and two moles of FFAs in second -order. In this way, FFAs will be consumed by whatever compound: glycerol, MAGs or DAGs. The more reactions, the more consumed FFAs moles. As was aforementioned, for drawing these conclusions, it was hypothesized that additional reactions (reverse reactions, reactions 5, 6) might affect the speed of FFAs conversion, without influencing the final concentration equilibrium .", "Table 29.

The individual effect of temperature, vacuum , and glycerol/oil mass ratio were found significant for FFAs and TAGs responses, whereas only temperature and vacuum were important for PCI. Although all the parameters interactions were non -significant for FFAs and TAGs, for PCI, temperature -vacuum and temperature -glycerol/oil mass ratio presented a significant influence on the response. It was proven the temperature is the most relevant parameter since it was significant for whole responses and only its interaction with other parameters was influential on PCI. Thus, temperature should be set cautiously for obtaining the expected outcomes. The mathematical modeling was attempted satisfactorily throughout the response surface methodology, being the two -factor interaction model able to explain the FFAs and TAGs data and, a quadratic model suitable to fit PCI values. The set range of the variab les demonstrated insufficient to establish maximum and minimum points for FFAs and TAGs responses.

The outcomes also evidenced that acidic content of crude glycerol works as an excellent catalyst for FFAs reduction a nd could be used in a time length of 10 hours; nonetheless, the content of DAGs is superior to the content of TAGs and PCI is higher. The additional impurities present in crude glycerol demonstrated to be unfavorable as they aid the TAGs decomposition and oil degradation, demanding a pos -refining process for the use in -situ.

The harnessing of glycerol glut and residual corn stillag e has a great potential to overcome the drop of glycerol price and the lack of waste management in the corn bioethanol trade .", "6.2 FUTURE WORK", "• Explore different conditions with an experimental design to improve the extent of FFAs conversion, TAGs formation and PCI using glycerol acidified with HCl and crude glycerol.", "• Test other types of inorganic acids and organic acids to develop better responses . • Prove the application of heterogeneous catalysts in the reaction. • Carry out the transesterification p rocess with the pre -treated DCO to determine the yield of biodiesel production and evaluate its properties. • Test a simple and cheap pre -treatment for crude glycerol prior to the use for esterification.", "• Perform an in -depth kinetic study considering the multiple reactions schemes and the concentration of glycerol, MAGs and DAGs.", "BIBLIOGRAPHIC REFERENCES ABDUL RAMAN, A.

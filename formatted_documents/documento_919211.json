(2020), namely theCGL model. We arethe ﬁrst to apply such a model fora port- folio built from the European stock market perspective. We originally characterize a four-regime economy from daily data, which is one step ahead of previous multi-regime researches that captured fewer regimes for European asset allocation. We identiﬁed not only the traditional bull and bear markets, but also extremely volatile regimes as the boom (positive) and the crash (negative) ones, which has allowed the allocation model to capture market trends in a more eﬃcient way. Given such conﬁguration, we ﬁrst performed accuracy assessments, concluding that the model provides adequate closed-form solutions for the maximization of the investor’s stochastic diﬀerential util- ity. Then, we analyzed the CGL model performance with an out-of sample application. Results have shown that the CGL allocation is signiﬁcantly dependent on the current regime that rules the economy (which is not directly observable). When comparing the performances with benchmark portfolios under traditional performance ratios, re- sults revealed clear superiority of the CGL model. We conclude that the CGL model opens attractive opportunities for investors and fund managers in the quest for asset allocation strategies that can quickly and reliably optimize future returns in uncertain economic environments.", "Keywords: Asset allocation; Dynamic portfolio allocation model; Regime- switching economies; Allocation strategies. Optimization portfolio problems; Euro- pean stock market.", "CONTENTS APPENDICES", "1 Introduction", "SincetheseminalworkofMarkowitz(1952)onportfoliotheory, assetallocationhas been a much investigated topic by investors to optimize portfolio returns while mini- mizing context risks. Following this ﬁrst and simplistic approach, time-continuous dy- namic models introduced by Merton (1973) demonstrated superior portfolio strategies permitting inter-temporal hedging. Another important milestone in tactical asset al- location came with the introduction of Markov chains models by Hamilton (1989). For example, Schwert (1989) showed that working with Markow-Switching (MS) regimes allows a better inference of the economy shifts and permits to uncover unobservable parameters, enabling more accurate ﬁnancial forecasts. Later, Tu (2010) detailed how models that take into account these cycles, either considering observable or hidden regimes, outperform models which ignore them.", "Assuming that investors ﬁnd their felicity from terminal wealth and/or interme- diate consumption under diﬀerent settings, various analytical or numerical strategic asset allocation models suggest solutions for the optimal portfolio problem (e.g., Bren- nan et al. (1997), Wachter (2010) and Campbell et al. (2004)). Current state of the art approaches consist of ﬁnding a solution for realistic (but more complex) utility func- tions under a regime-switching economy. By being the ﬁrst model to oﬀer an analytical (approximate) solution to the optimal portfolio problem in a regime-switching econ- omy under the stochastic diﬀerential utility function of Duﬃe and Epstein (1992), the model introduced by Campani et al. (2020), hereafter noted as the CGL model, opens new perspectives for real-time portfolio selection and dynamic investment strategy. Campani et al. (2020) started by presenting the eﬃciency of their analytical model within the US market, while Lewin and Campani (2020a,b) did an equivalent work regarding the model in the Brazilian economy. Now, this research investigates if the application of the CGL model could outperform benchmarks in the European stock market which oﬀer a large amount of opportunities within geographically diversiﬁed markets.", "Academics such as Krolzig and Toro (2005) showed the existence of economic cycles inEurope,whichindicatestheimportanceofMSmodels. Tothebestofourknowledge, previous researches used only up to three regimes to describe and analyze European markets in order to oﬀer an asset allocation strategy for investing in such countries. We were able to ﬁnd 4 regimes.", "We apply the CGL model to empirically solve an optimal portfolio problem formed with 5 equity indices (4 European major blue chip indices and the S&P500 US index) and the risk-free investment. We validate the model with an out-of-sample simulation based on daily returns. Our work also innovates by characterizing the European econ- omy with four MS regimes that better capture the business cycles when compared to previous research in the RS portfolio allocation literature. Moreover, we contribute to the development of the CGL literature by implementing a constrained optimization of the Hamilton and Susmel (1994) ﬁlter for parameter estimation, which improves the parameters ﬁt robustness – a critical step for the model accuracy. Our conclusions show that the European four regimes may present short duration cycles, some regimes in the order of a few days. In this setting, the CGL model outperforms the benchmarks on most indicators during most years in the period of 2000-2019. Although multi-regime based models usually indicate highly leveraged portfolios bringing together high turnover ratios, future simple mitigation strategies could be proven eﬀective: We also discuss some possible venues in this context.", "2 Literature Review", "With the advent of the computer era, Brennan et al. (1997) showed that strate- gic asset allocation would become a central problem for investors who search felicity maximizing the utility of their investment returns while remaining within their risk tolerance. In this context, dynamic models were raised, permitting the investor to hedge against uncertainty not only against states but also though time. In this endeavor, structural changes in the economy have long been introduced in models either with threshold or smoothed transition factors. Yet, Hamilton (1989) seminal work and his introduction of a speciﬁc ﬁlter for Markov chains and hidden regimes paved the way for a broader use of MS models in the asset allocation world. The approach fostered increased interest for regime-switching models both in the aca- demic area and among practitioners. Ang and Bekaert (2004) and Ang and Timmer- mann (2012) could show for instance the important consequences regime switches can have on the investor solution when choosing an optimal portfolio. Parameters such as means, volatilities and cross-covariances of asset returns feature signiﬁcant diﬀerences acrossregimesandhighlyinﬂuenceﬁnancialseriesbehavior. GuidolinandHyde(2012) showed that vector auto-regressive models were not able to capture regime shifts in asset returns while Tu (2010) showed that signiﬁcant losses (in the order of 2% per annum) arise from the use of a single-regime model with respect to a multi-regime one. Solutions for portfolio optimal allocation in a MS regime economy came ﬁrst from numerical approaches. With observable regime and without considering consump- tion, Guidolin and Timmermann (2006) solve the problem in a discrete time setting in the form of the roots of a system of polynomial equation (ﬁrst-order condition). With unobservable regimes this time, Guidolin and Timmermann (2007) provided a simulation-based solution in a four unobservable regime economy. They work again within a discrete-time setting and with power time-additive utility. Although numerical solutions can provide accurate results, analytical solutions of- fers a better evaluation of the parameters and their inﬂuence on the asset allocation. Honda (2003) published such a solution of the optimal portfolio problem under unob- servable regimes for the mean return of the risky assets (but not for its volatility). The model assumed a power utility from consumption and terminal wealth in a continuous time model with two hidden regimes. Yet, it becomes analytical only for the speciﬁc and quite unrealistic Constant Relative Risk-Aversion (CRRA) value of other values, the model authors derived a numerical solution with Monte Carlo sim- ulation by applying a Martingale approach. In a comparable approach, Liu (2011) used as well a martingale method to develop a continuous-time intertemporal model that solves the consumption-portfolio problem. He worked with two hidden Markov states under ambiguity and provided a solution in terms of Mallavian derivatives and stochastic integrals.", "Zhou and Yin (2003) suggested a solution for the investor portfolio choice in a continuous time setting under a MS regime economy. They built a mean-variance portfolio selection model whose closed-form solution does not include however con- sumption and is set in a completely observable regime state. With similar observable regimes, Sotomayor and Cadenillas (2009) included consumption in their model. They were able to derive an explicit optimal solution for investment and consumption for two HARA utility functions (the log-utility and the power utility ones), however under inﬁnite horizon. Shen and Siu (2017) worked with unobservable regimes in which felic- ity comes from discounted utility from intermediate consumption and terminal wealth but their closed-form solution is solely derived for power utility. Explicit solutions for optimal portfolio are actually often derived with the power utility function. Despite its convenient manipulation, it unrealistically links the in- vestor risk aversion with the elasticity of consumption substitution parameter. To overcome this limitation, Duﬃe and Epstein (1992) introduced the stochastic diﬀeren- tial utility function allowing to disentangle the two behavioral aspects of the investor for recursive preference models as introduced by Epstein and Zin (1989). Campani et al. (2020) are the ﬁrst to present an analytical (though approximate) solution for the portfolio decision under the stochastic diﬀerential utility function in a multi-regime model. To solve the problem, the CGL model introduced a multiple regime setting to the approximate solution developed by Campani and Garcia (2019). The method presents a fairly accurate solution in the US and Brazilian markets, re- spectively, according to Campani et al. (2020) and Lewin and Campani (2020a). Both articles worked with four asset portfolios; two equity indices and two ﬁxed income indices. In both works, the authors found only negligible values for the wealth equiva- lent losses aroused from the comparison between the CGL model against the optimal (numerical) solution. More recently, given a portfolio with ﬁve assets, Lewin and Campani (2020b) computed for the ﬁrst time a CGL model out-of-sample portfo- lio performance evaluation with periodical reestimation of all the model parameters. Their work showed that the allocation strategy provided by the model outperforms the market benchmarks with statistical signiﬁcance.", "Given the relevance of these results, such analytical model can be useful for eq- uity investors maneuvering with geographically competing markets as encountered in Europe. Western Europe consists of developed countries oﬀering together one of the largest stock exchange market worldwide with opportunities often comparable to the ones available in the US. For an investor looking for geographical investment diversiﬁ- cation, European stocks become often a preferred choice. The CGL model is expected to signiﬁcantly enhance the opportunities of strategic asset allocation in the continent as previously performed by Ang and Bekaert (2002) under a model with two regimes on US, UK and German stocks. Yet, no work comparable to those applied to the American market in Guidolin and Timmermann (2007) and Campani et al. (2020), estimated four regimes in Europe.", "Business cycles across European markets have been already used in other related conﬁgurations. Artis et al. (2004) was a pioneer in identifying MS regimes in the Eu- ropean setting. Morana and Beltratti (2002) studied the regimes convergence within European stock markets following the introduction of the Euro currency. They identi- ﬁed three regimes characterized by diﬀerent volatilities: low, medium and high across UK, USA, Italy, Spain, Germany and France, where they observe non perfect cor- relations between regime switches across countries. Baele (2005) made used of MS regimes to study the spillover of equity volatility and came to conclude on the in- creasing integration of the European markets. Anas et al. (2004) and Krolzig (2013) went further by analyzing the business cycles in the European market after the intro- duction of the Euro, notably by the mean of MS model (MS Intercept and Regime Dependent Heteroscedasticity-Vector Autoregressive model). They found common cy- cles and symmetry between the European market, driven by shared macroeconomic activities and described by three regimes, although two were enough for France and Germany up to early 2000’s. One of their conclusion however is that with respect to the US market, regimes in the European monetary system are shorter lived. This is an additional point towards a model able to quickly and eﬃciently react to regime switches under a more realistic utility function, such as the stochastic utility, as oﬀered by the CGL model.", "Our research proposes the application of the CGL model in equity Western Europe markets to demonstrate its eﬃciency for the fast calculation of optimal portfolios. We move beyond the so far used MS regimes based strategies in Europe, estimating a four regime economy with the maximum-likelihood approach. We contribute to the CGL literature by adding constrains in the model parameter estimation based on the HamiltonandSusmel(1994)ﬁlter. Tobuildtheportfoliodynamicstrategy, weallocate among four main European market indices: CAC, DAX, FTSE100, SWM in addition to the S&P500 and a riskless investment.", "The remainder of this manuscript is structured as follows.

The regime transition dynamics (detailed in Appendix A) is exactly the same as in the original CGL model.", "To decide on the number of regimes that should be used in order to capture as best as possible the diﬀerent states of the European economy, we looked at previous published works on models using MS regimes. Bialkowski (2015) investigated the monthly returns of stock indices of central European markets with respect to western Europe and conﬁrmed the relevance of RS based models. He employed DAX, CAC40 and FTSE100 indices as markers of western Europe returns, but was however unable to determine a priori if a model of two or three regimes would better ﬁt these time series. Conversely, working in the US market, Guidolin and Timmermann (2004) showed that the evolution of stock and bond prices followed four distinct regimes: crash, slow growth, bull and boom states. They also provided evidence for the returns and volatilities dependence upon the underlying regimes. Here, we work with data encompassing pre- and post-Euro-currency introduction. Thus, in order to better capture variations in the European economy we adopted Guidolin and Timmermann (2004) as our guideline to study a four-regime model.", "3.2 The risky asset dynamics", "Withnrisky assets, we can write the assets dynamics in a 1\u0002nvector dSt=Stas a multidimensional stochastic process in the form:", "dSt In the equaton above, the vector \u0016s;tcontains the instantaneous risky assets ex- pected returns and the n\u0002nmatrix\u001bs;tis the inferior triangular matrix of volatilities.

For a time twith current running (hidden) regime Yt=i;i2R, we consider the (constant) asset parameters \u0016s;i and\u001bs;i.

The parameter estimation is a critical step in the conﬁguration and appli- cation of the model as they will be used to compute the probabilities of the regimes and the asset allocation solution. In previous applications of the CGL model, this step could represent a bottleneck since the estimation was originally elaborated using an unconstrained Maximum-Likelihood (ML) procedure starting from a single initial guess. Such estimation approach would lead for most optimizations to a local-minima which does not correspond to the best estimates.", "To overcome that limitation, we ﬁrst made adaptations to the ML estimation in- troduced by Dempster et al. (1977) and based on the ﬁlter of Hamilton and Susmel (1994) for the estimation of the regime probabilities. Our implementation now enables one to run ML estimation with constrains, in order to better ﬁt the estimated param- eters from past observations. Thus, several constrains were added to the optimization algorithm. In our case, with assets of the same class (stocks), we enforced positive correlation between them. Likewise, the average return per regime parameter were forced to be in ascending order for each of the asset. Numerically, the optimizations were interrupted when a parameter precision of at least 10\u00004was achieved. Secondly, the ML estimation optimizes the likelihood function iteratively and al- though the functional value increases monotically, the algorithm cannot guarantee the ﬁnding of a global maximum for an initial guess out of the converging radius. Similarly to Bialkowski (2015), we solved this issue by running 500 estimations starting from as many diﬀerent randomly generated initial guesses within reasonable boundaries. Eventually, the estimator whose log-likelihood function evaluation renders the maxi- mum value is retained as our ﬁnal estimator. A suﬃciently large number of diﬀerent initial guesses ensures the ﬁnding of the true maximum.", "The ML parameter estimation permits to infer both ﬁltered and smoothed prob- abilities.

Instead, we reduced the ML estimation from past data up to the beginning of each calendar year and kept the same parameter estimates over the following twelve months.

The extreme ones are the crash regime, where returns are negative and the volatility high, and the boom regime, which can often follow a crisis as a recovery trend with large positive returns. The slow growth regime refers to a market without strong direction that can sometimes be bearish with negative returns but in average has slightly positive excess returns. Finally, the bull regime compares well to the traditional deﬁnition of a bull market with a ﬂourishing and stable economical cycle.", "Table 1 and 2 provide the estimated regime parameters obtained when using the full data set available covering the period from March 1st1990 until January 31st2020.

Panel A of Table 2 shows the transition and ergodic probabilities as well as the average duration of each regime, while Panel B renders the assets’ volatility matrix necessary for the calculation of the CGL model solution (Appendix C details the calculation procedure for this volatility matrix). The reported values indicate that the American index is less aﬀected during the two extreme regimes, with lower amplitude of the risk premia. This lighter response to the crash and boom regimes can be due to the estimation approach that focus at the European economy rather than the American market, since the S&P500 being less correlated with the other indices. Moreover, the S&P500 capitalization is not aﬀected here by the currency exchange rate ﬂuctuation as the other indices are, reducing thereby the US stock index volatilities.", "In turn, the CAC and DAX indices present equivalent risk premia. In agreement with Morana and Beltratti (2002), this is explained by the markets convergence since the introduction of the common monetary policy, which is corroborated by the large correlation between both indices in all regimes. Meanwhile, the SWI index presents moderated correlation values with respect to other indices emphasizing the lower inter- dependency of the Swiss economy with its neighboring countries. Such speciﬁcity results in part from not being a full member of the European integrated market. Regarding the regimes, crash presents large negative mean risk premia and volatil- ities and switches most likely to the slow growth regime. This transition would often not mark the end of a crisis but an intermediate state before a potential new drop. Denoting a storm period of crisis, this regime is the shortest lived one and the less occurring one. Alternatively, the crash regime can transition to a boom period with large positive returns, signaling a recovery cycle. The boom regime has a short average duration and most likely transitions back to a bull regime where risk premia are also signiﬁcantly high but with lower volatilities. The slow growth regime features slightly larger volatilities than the bull regime whereas its risk premia are close to zero. This later regime is the longest lived one with 24 trading days on average, and transitions quasi-equally to the three other regimes with a preference for a crisis cycle. Finally, the bull regime is the other frequent regime, with 16 trading days of average duration. Figure 1 displays the regimes’ occurrences as translated by the smoothed probabil- ities. Therein, it’s possible to notice that daily data reveal regime switches triggered by minor events which can inﬂuence the investors’ mood for a few days only. This translates for instance by short periods of boom regime. It is also remarkable that the slow growth regime mainly took place before the year 2004. The following period was dominated by the bull regime, possibly favored by the credit access policies imple- mented during that era and that leaded to the subprime crisis of 2008 and later by the quantitative easing policies. In practice, the slow growth regime almost disappeared after 2004 in favor of the new predominance of the bull regime.

In this endeavor, we calculated and compared two dynamic strategies for diﬀerent horizons ranging from a single day to 126 trading days (approximately half a year); the CGL model and MCS. The original methodologies for applying the CGL model, as derived by Campani et al. (2020), and MCS, published by Guidolin and Timmermann (2007), are respectively detailed in Appendices D and E. These works studied horizons up to 10 years under monthly data, hence covering 120 periods. Here, we select our maximum horizon in a comparable manner to these authors and with a magnitude comparable to the one used by Lewin and Campani (2020a) who studied a strategy with an horizon up to 260 periods (weeks).", "Table 3 presents the asset allocation weights computed by the CGL model, which stands for the sub-optimal portfolio as it relies on an approximate (analytic) solu- tion. For comparison, the table presents the MCS allocation representing the optimal (numeric) solution. Additionally, it displays the wealth equivalent loss of the CGL solutions with respect to the MCS solutions for each conﬁguration. The parameters used to compute this table were estimated using the full data set from 01/03/1991 to 31/01/2020 given diﬀerent horizons. The table reports values for two scenarios. In one, the investor computes the portfolio solution considering the next regime as certain (100% of probability). In the other case, the investor has no access to the next period regime information and calculates the portfolio strategy considering either ergodic or equally-weighted probabilities.", "Analyzing the dynamic weights, the investor short sells all but FTSE stocks during the crash regime whilst in the slow growth regime she tends to stay out of the stock market with no strong positions with the money kept at the risk free rate. This contrasts to the bull and boom regimes where the investor borrows heavily at the risk free rate to invest in long positions in SP500, SWI and DAX. In these two regimes, FTSE and CAC are however shorted to hedge against uncertainty. When the investor does not have access to the next period regime, she invests in a more balanced way between the assets, the hedging component of the weights being more felt with respect to the myopic part. Uncertainty aﬀects thus greatly the asset allocation strategy. Whentheinformationaboutthenextperiodremainsunavailable,thestrategybecomes less aggressive with a lower level of leverage in the portfolio. The dynamic model solutions are highly leveraged with money borrowed at the risk free rate at almost up to six folds the investor wealth for the value of it is possible to notice in equation 3.10 that the portfolio weights present a hyperbolic behavior with respect to the investor risk aversion. Figure 2 illustrates this scaling where we observe the portfolio weights remaining stable and much less leveraged for value of greater than 15. Such hyperbolic scaling is actually also due to the minor eﬀect of the hedging component in the solution of the CGL model solution. Figure 3 shows the hedging part of the asset weight as the function of the horizon. The boom regime generated the greatest hedging demand while FTSE weights consist almost solely of the myopic part. The plotted values emphasize the relatively weak variations of the hedging demand with the horizon (by only a few percentage points) which come in line with the observation from Campani et al. (2020) under monthly data. This mild eﬀect of the hedging component and hence investor time horizon when calculating the portfolio weights, must be put in contrast with the eﬀect and importance of the ﬁltered probabilities which impacts much more strongly the solution as translated by the values of table 3.", "Table 3 right most column presents the wealth equivalent loss to assess the CGL model accuracy. Campani et al. (2020) used it to evaluate the model accuracy under monthly observations while Lewin and Campani (2020a), under weekly observations. Now we run the equivalent test with daily data. For a better visualization of the trends, ﬁgure 4 plots the WEL as a function of the investor horizon for each regime being certain to occur in the next period, for the ergodic probabilities and for the equal probabilities.", "TheCGL weights, divergesmore fromthe optimal solutionwhen theﬁltered proba- bilities are mixed, represented by the ergodic or equal probabilities cases, thus pointing to a more uncertain future. In such cases, the equivalent loss reaches up to 0.38% per trading day when setting a 126 day horizon and continues to diverge linearly beyond as seen in ﬁgure 4. This can be explained by the factor (V\u0019t) = (V\u0019inf)considered constant in the model. In practice, the situations where the ﬁltered probabilities are mixed usually identify to moments of transition between regimes (with a most likely regime probability bellow 50%), such cases representing less than 25% of all observa- tions in our data set. As seen in table 3, leverage decreases with more uncertain future. Often, the most likely regime for the next period present a fairly high probability level: the most likely regime probability averages at more than 80% probability for at least half of the days. This average situation can be identiﬁed to the high certainty cases presented in table 3 (the case of 100% certainty is used to simplify the illustration). In the case where the next period regime is already certain, the WEL remains below 0.05% even for larger horizons. In practice, an investor having access to mixed ﬁltered probabilities would suﬀer a WEL between the extreme cases (inaccessible information or certainty) presented here and corresponding to the central area in the plot of ﬁgure Finally, the overall magnitude of the losses generated by the CGL model would be considered acceptable by most practitioners. Such comparison of dynamic as- set allocation approaches provides evidence of the approximate CGL model accuracy when working at higher frequency data rate and when using a larger number of assets with respect to the previous works of Campani et al. (2020) and Lewin and Campani (2020a). Finally, it also enables a better identiﬁcation of the factors responsible for the deviation of the CGL model from the optimal solution obtainable numerically, i.e., the investor horizon and the future uncertainty.", "5.3 Out-of-sample performance", "Weperformedanout-of-samplesimulationusingmovingwindowsovertwentyyears to benchmark the dynamic solution of the CGL model with respect to four other portfolios. Two of them are based on models neglecting the existence of regimes, namely: the equally-weighted portfolio and the single-regime model. The equally- weighted portfolio, also called 1=nor naive portfolio, was selected as it became a performance benchmark since DeMiguel et al. (2009) demonstrated how this strategy actually beats a fairly large number of models based on complex rules of optimality. The portfolio we refer to as single-regime (SR) model is a solution employing the stochastic utility function from Duﬃe and Epstein (1992) as the CGL model does, but not taking into account the existence of multiple regimes. When compared to the CGL solution, the SR model benchmarks the importance of applying the regimes in asset allocation. The last portfolio is based on the optimal (numeric) solution, where we evaluate the returns of the MCS based portfolio to compare and assess the experimental validity of the CGL dynamic approach. For these dynamic approaches, we consider an investor with an horizon of half a year (126 days) which is a horizon that will cover many economical cycles.", "TocomputetheCGLandMCSsolutions,weconsideredaninvestorhavingaccessto the ﬁltered probabilities at the moment of investing. These probabilities are obtained using estimated parameters recalculated yearly from the past ten calendar year data and not the full data sample as in the previous sections. For this reason the ﬁltered probabilitiesdisplayedinﬁgure5diﬀerfromthesmoothedprobabilities(ﬁgure1). The ﬁltered probabilities reﬂect the information available at the time when the investor has to make her decision. She has access of course to a lower amount of data than one would have retrospectively while the parametrization of the regime also evolves as newer data are incorporated. Nevertheless, already from such investor perspective, ﬁgure 5 shows that the regimes with higher volatilities (regimes 1 and 4 as presented in Table 1) are often paired with crashing and booming recovery periods such as the 2002 or 2008 crises, or even more minor downturns. Conversely, less extreme regimes are, as anticipated, to happen more often. Filtered probabilities would hence represent precious information in the investor decision process. To evaluate the CGL performance, ﬁgure 6 permits to investigate the cumulative and yearly log-returns obtained on each calendar year. Considering the compounding eﬀects over twenty years, the equally-weighted and single-regime portfolios eventually present returns three orders of magnitude smaller than the CGL and MCS solutions. Apartfromtheyear2018,theequally-weightedandsingle-regimeportfoliosalwayspre- sentedyearlyexcessriskpremiumsremainingclosetozerowhilethedynamicstrategies clearly oﬀer superior yearly returns. Likewise, the comparison between the CGL and MCS returns reveals that the eﬀect of the approximation used by the CGL model is minimum, validating our accuracy test conclusion. As for the relatively poor performance of the CGL model during the period 2000- 2002, one could argue that the estimation based on ten-years-data delivered misﬁt parameters. The underlying explanation there would be the shock generated by Euro introduction in 1999 and the markets’ transition to converging trends hence after. To enhance the comparison, we also plotted in ﬁgure 6 the portfolio solution cal- culated for an investor using the ergodic as the ﬁltered probabilities. Under this assumption, the dynamic portfolios (CGL erg. and MCS erg.) often under-perform the reference portfolios (ﬁltered probabilities), which shows the strong necessity to frequently recalculate the optimal portfolio at each new ﬁltration available. Table 4 presents these average daily return per as well as other performance indi- cators to assess the CGL performance on the out-of-sample simulation with respect to the non-dynamic portfolios. The MCS portfolio is also reported here and is seen to follow very closely the one of the CGL model. The table provides for each year and for the full period the daily average return, Sharpe and Sortino ratios for the observed portfolios. These performance indicators are also plotted in ﬁgure 7 for a better visual rendering and comparison.", "Due to the high leveraging of the CGL portfolio, the model return volatility is greater than the compared strategies. Therefore and despite its greater returns for all years(except2018), theCGLportfoliopresentsfouryearswhereitsSharpeandSortino indicators are inferior. For this same reason, the CGL portfolio CEQ under quadratic utility is lower than the reference portfolios for almost half of the years. In spite of the greater loss of the CGL model solution for the speciﬁc year of 2018, the portfolio provided greater Sharpe and Sortino ratios for this period. The negative skewness and high kurtosis visible in ﬁgure 7 for that particular year indicate that its return was aﬀected by a few days of unusual large negative returns. When considering the full twenty-year period, the CGL model surpasses clearly the other reference portfolios. Overall, the returns of the CGL portfolio present third and fourth moments com- parable to the benchmarks when normalizing for the volatility. In parallel, the CGL performance indicators could almost directly been scaled with the investor risk aver- sion considering the hyperbolic scaling of the portfolio weights as a function of 1= (see equation 3.10).", "The values reported for the MCS calculations demonstrates empirically the equiv- alent performances obtained from the dynamic MCS and the CGL model, hence vali- dating the approximation used in the CGL model analytical derivation. To assess the statistical robustness of the calculated CGL model performance, we tested the average return of the CGL portfolio against the indices composing it and against the reference portfolios. We used both a bootstraping approach (see Efron and Tibshirani (1993)) and the Wilcoxon rank sum test (which is better suited for non parametricdistributions)toevaluatewhethertheCGLmodelreturnswerestatistically greater than the indices and reference portfolios. Hence, our null hypothesis was that the CGL model returns are not greater in average than the indices and reference portfolios. The full time series of returns calculated from 01-01-2000 to 31-12-2019 was used within the two tests. Table 5 reports the test p-values obtained for the two tests on the series average. With all p-values far below 1%, the null hypothesis is rejected with high statistical signiﬁcance, conﬁrming the superiority of the CGL portfolios in term of returns over the non dynamic portfolios and more noticeably over the ﬁve assets composing it.", "We look next into more details at the CGL portfolio returns in term of assets and most likely regime. Table 6 presents the out-of-sample calculation results for the period 2000-2019. There, the next most probable regime was calculated for each investment period and the portfolio returns computed for each asset. The annualized returns in the table then show the average asset return when one regime was the most likely to happen and the average daily return is also provided for each most likely next period regime. The calculated values show that CAC did not generate eﬀectively revenues in our simulation but was rather used to hedge against risk. FTSE was the asset generating the greatest returns in extreme regimes while SWI had positive returns in any regime. Regarding the economic cycles, boom is the regime with the largest returns following the trend of the market itself. The slow growth regime is the one whose excess returns are the lowest, the assets during this regime not having any speciﬁc trend in term of drifts prevent taking clear advantageous positions as observable in table 1. Conversely, the crash regime, although characterized by strong falls of the market capitalization, can be shown proﬁtable due to the clear direction of the market.", "Table 4 and ﬁgure 7 are performance indicators calculated over arbitrary delimited periods of time (calendar years) corresponding to the windows of parameter reestima- tion. To be more consistent with our ﬁxed horizon chosen as 126 trading days and the daily rebalancing, we also calculated the returns using a daily rolling window and the results are shown in ﬁgure 8. There, one can notice shorter periods where the benchmarks outperform the CGL strategy. However, the superior performances of the CGL based models become more striking during storm and recovery periods, i.e., when the market volatilities are high (regime 1 and 4). As a matter of fact, the CGL model presents globally better Sharpe and Sortino ratios than the reference portfolios. These indicators turned to be highly in favour of the CGL model during crisis, indicating that the multi-regime approach prevents major losses during periods of downturns or high volatilities.", "With ﬁgure 9, we analyzed the leverage obtained by the CGL solution.

The right part of the table displays the corresponding CEQ calculated under power utility from the bequest. Increasing avoids bankruptcy as it would happen to risk lovers investors but with the side eﬀect of bringing the CEQ toward zero with the reduction of the gains. Again, these CEQ values are greatly aﬀected by the CGL portfolio return volatility by deﬁnition and as one can see for the full period, the CEQ is always negative whatever the value of considered.", "Hence, when increasing reduces the CGL model CEQs to level equivalent to the ones achievable with other portfolio but such reduction of the investor risk and hence CEQ through the returns volatility would however only happen at the cost of the cancellation of potential additional returns scaling hyperbolically. The table starts with a value of two since lower values would eventually brings the investor out of business and generate unrealistic CEQs.", "The CGL model oﬀers a highly leveraged portfolio which needs a mitigation scheme to generate in practice a workable turnover ratio. Table 8 presents the eﬀect of varying the rebalancing frequency over the CGL returns per year or for the full twenty year period from 2000 to 2019. Average daily returns are moderately aﬀected when the investor rebalances the portfolio every other day, but the same does not apply under weeklyorbimonthlyrebalancing, wheretheCGLmodeleﬃciencysigniﬁcantlydropsas seen with the return calculated for isntance for the full period. A weekly or bimonthly rebalancing cancels out some of the gain brought by the multi-regime model and even create losses for some of the years when the regimes are volatile (e.g., the period 2008-2010). This behavior indicates the existence of short lived regimes, which last only a few days conforming the estimation displayed in table 2. The crash and boom regimes average duration are for instance around six days. Besides, a lower rebalancing frequency does not aﬀect much the CGL portfolio volatility, leading to Sharpe ratios following the trend of the model return as a function of the rebalancing. If a daily rebalancing is expected to provide in theory the best return for the model, on the other hand, this happens at the cost of a large turnover. The table shows 8 that the turnover ratios of the weekly and bimonthly rebalancing strategies often decrease by a greater ratio than the corresponding returns. The turnovers fall often by a factor three or more times greater than the returns’ decrease (e.g., the years 2011-2013). Modulating the rebalancing frequency is therefore a trivial approach an investor might apply in order to mitigate the friction costs but at the expense of lower returns.", "Going further, table 8 also displays the return for the DRF strategy where rebal- ancing is only performed when the most likely regime changes and with an inertia of one day (median ﬁlter of size three, see section 3.5). Rebalancing frequency under this easy approach is equivalent to 8.6 day rebalancing period, but with better average returns (0.063% daily return in average for the DRF strategy against 0.034% for the 8.6 day rebalancing strategy). The gain is even greater after the period 2000-2003 where regimes had a diﬀerent behavior compared to the rest of the considered period. With the DRF, the number of rebalancing in average always remained below the one of a weekly rebalancing (52 switches per year). The DRF adapts also well to the volatility of the markets with for instance almost no switch in the years 2004-2006 with a ﬂourishing and stable economic cycle and the opposite for the years 2008-2009. The Sharpe ratio with the DRF also improves with respect to the equivalent regular rebalancing strategy of 8.6 days (respectively cSRDRF = 0:04andcSR8:6days= 0:02). Thus, this out-of-sample simulation let us foresee that more sophisticated approaches could be implemented by practitioners to keep turnovers within acceptable limits.", "6 Conclusion", "We demonstrated the validity of the CGL model within the European market. Our setting presented four regimes closely related to the literature of Guidolin and Timmermann (2007, 2008), although those studies were applied in the US economy. Our research enabled a more complete depiction of European economic cycles than previous works. We were able to deﬁne more extreme regimes whose occurrence, although less frequent, strongly aﬀects the portfolio overall performance. In order to estimate our 4-regime switching model, long data-series were neces- sary. We suggest practitioners and analysts to consider working with relatively high frequency data, as we did with daily data. Despite the rebalancing challenges, the approach allows to capture regimes which last only a few days or weeks. Short du- ration regimes might reﬂect changes in investors mood resulting from minor events, which would go unnoticed on weekly or monthly data frequency. In addition, the daily reassessment of ﬁltered probabilities oﬀers faster responses to extreme regimes and specially the mitigation of losses due to a lesser inertia eﬀect. The next level of extension of the method involves working with time-varying regime parameters, where the most recent parameter estimation also undergoes a daily update. Our accuracy tests corroborated the ﬁndings from Campani et al. (2020) and Lewin and Campani (2020a): the CGL model losses for being an approximate solution are negligible when compared to the MCS optimal solution under realistic market con- ditions when investors take the observed returns and update their regimes probabili- ties. The out-of-sample simulation highlighted the importance of multi-regime models for asset allocation. The CGL model clearly outperforms two benchmark portfolios proposed by a single-regime investor, and the traditional equally weighted portfolio. Considering the time span from 2000 to the end of 2019, the CGL model presented returns greater than the benchmarks for all years but 2018.

For each 4-regime probability vector with values in the grid, the right hand side wealth evolution of the recursive equation E.27 is calculated with the Monte-Carlo approach. A large number of current regime draws N= 100 000 distributed according to the current regime probabilities (the 4-regime probability vector) permits to sim- ulate returns and approximate the expected distribution. For each random draw, we infer the next regime probabilities using the transition probability matrix (as does the the Hamilton ﬁlter of equation 3.4).

This loss is deﬁned as the additional money an investor using the CGL model would have to invest more than an equivalent investor using MCS so that they both achieve equal utility from their investment. Mathematically, the wealth equivalent loss is obtained equalizing equation E.26 which is the optimal one for the MCS investor with the same utility function of the CGL model user where the value of H\u0010 ^Yt+1jt;t\u0011 is suboptimal.
